<p><span class="atmosphere">It is the year 2013, or later. You have just navigated to the earliest post of Eli Dupree's wildly popular website, which has over 100,000 regular readers. Eli has released at least one full graphic novel here, as well as dozens of short stories, songs, games, and other cool things, and is currently in the midst of an even more massive project, which ze is hoping to finish within a month or two.</span></p>

<p>That's right, I'm talking to you &ndash; you, the reader. Usually, when someone writes "now", or uses present-tense verbs, they mean the time at which they're speaking. But in this post, the present is the time when you're reading it, which I have just claimed is the year 2013 or later. People who write blogs usually talk to the other people from the present, and I'm going to go back to doing that with my second post, but I thought it would be fun to talk to you people from the future instead, just for once. Of course, I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but it's a lot more fun to just assume I'm right than to stick a phrase like <q>I'm guessing that</q> in front of everything.</p>

<p>First posts weren't a thing that I thought I liked writing, back when I wrote this post in the middle of 2011. Usually, when I started to get involved in a new thing, I would try to do it a little at a time, rather than make a big, flashy entrance. After all, people usually get more skilled, not less, over time, so how can a first post, or first performance, or first musical album, ever hope to live up to what will come after it? But a good challenge is always fun, so here, the challenge was this: Make a first post that is <em>so awesome</em> that it will still be awesome now that you've seen everything that comes after it.</p>

<p>Since part of the point of this website is to advance the cause of social justice, I did consider the idea of ignoring the issue of awesomeness for this post, and dedicating it to some specific cause instead. On the other hand, I didn't want the symbolic nature of a <em>first</em> post to imply that I was setting up one issue as more important than the other. I wouldn't have been able to consider anything thoroughly, because I would have felt obligated to make everything perfect and even-handed, which is impossible &ndash; exactly the issue that made me reluctant to write an epic first post originally. I did make a lot of posts about various social issues soon after this one, but this one was completely dedicated to awesomeness; I didn't even bother to advocate on my own behalf by explaining the gender-neutral pronoun I used in the first paragraph!</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to make a bunch of ambitious claims about my future success!</p>

<h2>It's at least 2013</h2>

<p>The first question I had to ask myself was this: Who are you? Who will be reading this post? And that led me to a very interesting series of conclusions.</p>

<p>First, the way this website is set up, it is easy to go back to the beginning and read the first post. And there was really only a very short window of opportunity for this post to have been displayed on the first page; therefore, it's almost certainly true that you've deliberately looked back to read it, rather than reading it at the time it was posted.</p>

<p>Second, a good website's readership tends to increase exponentially over time, as more people hear about it, post links to it, and so on. What this means is that there are always a lot more late joiners than early joiners. However, the number of posts <em>I</em> make in that time doesn't increase exponentially, so the late joiners won't have a much harder time reading all the way back to the first post, even ignoring the readers who deliberately jump back to the beginning. This inevitably leads to the conclusion that more late joiners will read this post than early joiners. And what that means is that, assuming I keep producing this website through, say, 2016, <em>you are almost certainly arriving after 2013, regardless of how effectively I publicized it in 2011.</em></p>

<p>That raises some interesting issues. It means that I'm talking to the majority, while the people who read my posts within a few days are the minority. Most blog posts, by using present-tense verbs to refer to the <em>writer's</em> time, subtly privilege their present-day audience, by placing them in the present; they allow later readers to view the record of events, but do not directly address those readers. Or worse, the present tense refers only to the author's present, ignoring the readers entirely! When a person writes something, and another person reads it, there are two people involved; why should the language establish the time of one event, the writing, while ignoring the time of the other event, the reading, entirely? When I wrote the next few posts after this one, it was only linguistic convention that made me write for the minority of readers from the present, or the even smaller minority of myself. What justification did I have for mentally privileging the present-day minority over the silent majority of onlookers from the future? Or was the future truly so limited that it was right for me to have valued my influence on my present-day readers more highly?</p>

<p>Let's move on.</p>

<h2>I have 100,000 readers</h2>

<p>Okay, this one was a bit more of a gamble. I didn't actually know for sure that my website would become this popular. But when I made that gamble, the outcomes were skewed in my favor, for two reasons: First, if I was right, then <strong>lots</strong> of people would know I was right, while if I was wrong, relatively few people would know I was wrong. Second, if I was right, then it would be very impressive that I had accurately claimed such a large readership, while if I was wrong, it wouldn't have been that much of a disappointment, since it's such a high number I was aiming for in the first place. (True, if I've ended up with ten million readers by now, the 100,000 looks like a pittance, but I don't think you'll fault me for claiming <em>only</em> 100,000!) And by the same logic from the last section, if I ever have that many readers, then in the long run, most of the people who read <em>this</em> post will read it when my claims are true!</p>

<p>But that paragraph makes it sound like I wasn't actually that confident about my ability to acquire a large reader base. On the contrary, I definitely was! I had lots of reasons to believe that I would gain a wide following:</p>

<p>1) I went into this task with the specific intention of making my posts easy to read, engaging, and thought-provoking. I wanted this to be a website that all kinds of people could both enjoy and learn from. Thus, I had reason to hope that it would spread both among people who enjoyed reading it for its own sake, and also among people who were serious activists and liked the ideas it was expressing.</p>

<p>2) Remember that graphic novel I mentioned in the first paragraph? I released it one page at a time, in a serial format &ndash; i.e. as a webcomic. It's a well-known fact that publishing a webcomic with a regular update schedule brings readers back over and over again. And the e-mail notification system is also an effective way to keep up with the website without having to actively reload the page, for people who have e-mail addresses that they check regularly.</p>

<p>3) This should probably have been the first item on this list, because it's the most important: <em>The stuff I do is really cool</em>. That's why my website was able to spread so quickly by word of mouth (or word of blog, or word of instant message): Lots of people read it and wanted to tell their friends about it &ndash; people just like you! Sadly, doing really cool stuff isn't always enough to become popular. History, up to and including the present, is full of examples of marginalized people who did really cool things and weren't recognized for it. But in my case, my cool abilities combined favorably with my societal privileges to bring you a product that can hopefully work towards demolishing the very injustices that created this situation in the first place!</p>

<p>(Yeah, I was an optimist when I wrote this post. You'd better hope I still am.)</p>

<h2>I've done lots of massive projects</h2>

<p>I'm afraid I went for a bit of a cop-out on this one. Of <em>course</em> I'm working on a massive project... I'm <em>always</em> working on a massive project!</p>

<p>Writing this <em>website</em> was a massive project. Just before that, I finished up a semester of college by writing a <em>novella</em> (which I posted on this website later in 2011). Before I wrote the novella, I was working on writing my own <em>music composition software</em>, and in the middle of all that, I was acting in a full-length <em>play</em>. And a day or two after I wrote this post, I started working in earnest on my next massive project, where I wrote my own <em>graphics editing</em> software &ndash; the same software I went on to use to write the <em>graphic novel</em> I mentioned.</p>

<p>So, in short, I had this very clear knowledge: I would have been walking on treacherous ground if I had claimed that I <em>wasn't</em> working on a massive project right now.</p>

<p>So keep an eye on the website, whatever year you're viewing it in, because... you know that massive project I'm doing? I'm hoping to finish it within a month or two.</p>

  "force_date":datetime.date(2011, 6, 10),

  "contents":'''

<autotitle>

<p>On my website, I have made it so that whenever someone uses any form of the pronoun "she" or "he" in a post or comment, it appears with a mark of scrutiny. Observe: She, he, her, him, hers, his, herself, himself.</p>

<p>I also avoid using those pronouns myself, and use the gender-neutral pronoun "ze" instead. I've listed the forms of "ze", as I use it, in the table below:</p>

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-width: 1">
  <tr><th>As subject</th><th>As object</th><th>Possessive<br/>adjective</th><th>Possessive<br/>pronoun</th><th>Reflexive</th></tr>
  <tr><td>she</td><td>her</td><td>her</td><td>hers</td><td>herself</td></tr>
  <tr><td>he</td><td>him</td><td>his</td><td>his</td><td>himself</td></tr>
  <tr><td>they</td><td>them</td><td>their</td><td>theirs</td><td>themself</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ze</td><td>zem</td><td>zir</td><td>zirs</td><td>zemself</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Because to say "she" or "he" is to explicitly declare a gender for another person, and that level of explicitness should be matched by how visible the word is in the sentence.</p>

<p>Since "she" and "he" are structural components of the language, it's very difficult to avoid using them if you're not willing to modify the language itself. And because they're so hard to avoid, they actively divide all humans into two classes: The "she"-humans and the "he"-humans.</p>

<p>That division is called "the gender binary". I don't like it.</p>

<p>If you include the gender binary in every sentence you write, speak, or think, then it becomes part of what you think about when you think about any person. You start judging people based on their apparent gender, rather than on whatever is actually relevant to the discussion. Obviously, that's a pretty silly idea. And given our world's huge amount of public and private discrimination against humans who don't fall neatly into the gender binary (hi!), and against humans who fit neatly but fall on the "she" side, it's not just a pretty silly idea &ndash; it's a totally terrible idea.</p>

<p>Consider this: Have you ever felt uncomfortable because you didn't know what gender another person was? Now, have you ever felt uncomfortable because you didn't know what another person's favorite color was? If you answered "Yes" and "No", then welcome to the wonderful world of thinking that gender is a uniquely essential quality of a person!<footnote((This is also a great analogy because lots of people just assume you have a favorite color, but not everyone naturally has one!))> Our social norms say that you're supposed to judge other people based on their genders, and so a lot of people get uncomfortable when they can't do what they're "supposed" to. The whole system of judgment sneaks into your head by starting with the benign-seeming judgement of whether you're supposed to use the "she" pronouns or the "he" pronouns.</p>

<p>But that turns out to not be such a benign judgement at all. When you do it, you're helping society judge whether whoever you're talking about is a "she"-human, or a "he"-human, or someone who doesn't really fit in the little boxes they're supposed to fit in. And when I say "society", I mean the kid sitting in the front of your class who's going to bully the doesn't-really-fit kid when you're not looking (or maybe when you are). I mean your male friend who doesn't think they're being sexist, but who always talks over their female friends in conversations. I mean the person who lives down the street, who seems pretty nice, who tried to rape and murder another person last week, just because the other person didn't fit our standards of "she" or "he".<footnote((Well, usually it's not <em>just</em> because they didn't fit in the gender binary. Usually it's also because they were a person of color, and/or mentally disabled, and/or homeless, and/or... well, you get the idea.))> Obviously, when a person commits rape or murder, they bear the sole responsibility. But that person thought it was okay because people like <em>you</em> said, "I care so little about <em>those people</em> that I won't even change the way I talk to stop excluding them."</p>

<h2>So what do we do about it?</h2>

<p>I don't expect you to stop using those pronouns entirely, any more than I expect you to magically solve all the world's problems at once. What you <em>can</em> do is to notice when you do it, and be aware of how that affects the way you're communicating.</p>

<p>Now, if only we had a way to do that automatically get your attention whenever you let one of those words pass without comment...? OH RIGHT.</p>

<p>If you're more ambitious, you can start cutting back on your use of these gendered pronouns, and start using gender-neutral pronouns. There are a variety of options for this. One is to use the singular "they"; if you look back over this post, you'll see that I used the singular "they" a lot. In most cases, it's unobtrusive and it gets the job done. Some people say it's grammatically incorrect, but those people are wrong.</p>

<p>"They" doesn't always work, though &ndash; one of the advantages of "she" and "he" is that they're two separate words, so they can, given the right genders of people, refer to two different people unambiguously. Getting rid of them already loses that advantage &ndash; it means that even if you have a female person and a male person, you still have to use the same pronoun for both of them &ndash; and it only gets worse if you also have to use the same pronoun for a group of people as for the individuals. So, it helps to have a pronoun that is third-person, explicitly singular, and doesn't assign a gender. English didn't have any of those for a while, but now it has lots of them. If you've read this website much, you've probably noticed that I use one of them in particular: "ze".</p>

<p>Since the structure of "ze" is so similar to the existing pronouns, I have had an easy time adding it to my vocabulary. And it has another nice advantage over "they": When people argue that I shouldn't use it, it's easy to engage in the real conversation about gender, while with "they", it often gets bogged down as a conversation about grammar.</p>

<p>The other most common gender-neutral pronouns are the Spivak set: ey, em, eir, eirs, emself. I personally don't like this set, because I feel like I'm mumbling when I say them out loud, not to mention that "ey" and "em" both have other meanings, or at least are pronounced the same as words that do. But it's a set I've seen used in a bunch of places, so I thought it would be prudent to mention it here. It also bears mentioning that there are a bunch of different variants of "ze", from ze/hir/hir/hirs/hirself to zhe/zhim/zher/zhers/zhimself; I picked the set I use simply because it feels the most natural to me.</p>

<p>That concludes my thoughts for now. Since this is the reference post for everywhere that "she" and "he" are scrutinized, I may update it from time to time.</p>

<p>This is going to be one of those posts that make me think "Why am I writing a post about this instead of doing it?!". But it's late at night and I'm not <em>really</em> going to get anything done before the morning, so I might as well go ahead and write this up.</p>

<p>So, I wrote a graphic short st&ndash; No, wait, I'm going to tell this in chronological order, starting from way back in the beginning. We could have a long argument about where the beginning really is, and whether it's really a net or lattice rather than a linear story that starts at a single beginning point, but we're not going to do that, because I'm the one telling this story, and I've picked one beginning point that I like best.</p>

<p>It begins with me dorking around with the images from an old computer RPG called <i>Sword Dream</i>. Or maybe it was <i>Yipe!</i>. How old am I &ndash; ten? Anyway, it was basically me taking images and drawing over them or recombining them. I wasn't very good at it, but it wasn't hard to do things like copying the head of a monster to make a monster that had two heads, or stuff like that. I had an <em>idea</em> of what I wanted to accomplish, but my tools didn't let me accomplish that. I was using old Mac software &ndash; GraphicConverter and ClarisWorks. Later, I started using the GIMP, but it wasn't much of an improvement, because it had the same basic problem: It wasn't a seamless extension of my underlying wills and desires! There's a saying, "Only a bad worker blames their tools"<footnote((Okay, that's not the original saying, but I think it's nicer when we don't use sexist and classist language.))>, but that saying was written by people who didn't have computers. Why should I ever do work that my computer can do for me? If you know me, you know that I insist on automating everything that can possibly be automated.</p>

<p>Shuffle the timeline around a bit because I don't remember what order this next stuff comes in. I spend lots of time drawing stuff in school &ndash; doodling, you might call it. I drew a lot of dragons. I mostly drew them in the same style &ndash; bold lines and shapes, little to no shading. When I did draw pictures where I used shading more, people told me they looked better, because they were more "realistic", but I didn't like them. What's the point of being realistic? If I wanted a realistic picture, I'd take a photograph. No &ndash; the goal of art is to produce something that's <em>better</em> than realism. It's to project our wills and desires through the medium and onto our audience. (To break the narrative a bit, look at my avatar on this site &ndash; the circular face with the yellow background, the broken-off pieces, and the wizard's hat. There's not a realistic image in the world that could convey the ideas that image conveys.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I go through some more computer games, most notably Spiderweb Software's <i>Blades of Exile</i>, and finally came to rest at the modern Free-and-open-source game, <i>Battle for Wesnoth</i>. (You'll probably hear more about my exploits in the BfW community in some other posts, too; I've committed a huge amount of time to it.) BfW had an active community of artists, and I learned a bunch of stuff from them. I tried my hand at making graphics for the game, but I was constantly frustrated by the software I had available to me. I actually liked ClarisWorks <em>better</em> than the GIMP for sprite editing<footnote((Oh by the way, a static 2d image used by a computer game is called a "sprite".))>, because it had a simpler user interface, without all the fancy controls of the GIMP. But I was picking the lesser of two evils. At some point during this time period, I decided that I should write my own sprite editing software, tuned to that specific task instead of being a general-purpose graphics editor like the GIMP. That's not what I'm doing now; I will probably never do that, because sprite art is a horrible kludge that only exists because of the limited resolution of computer monitors. Moving on...</p>

<p>Fast forward about three years. I've taken some serious art classes in high school, which made me pretty good at drawing things in a photo-realistic way, which is nice even if it's not the most important skill to have.<footnote((At the time of this writing, you can see some of my work from one of those classes at <a href="http://eli.cedarswampstudios.org/drawing-1-sketchbook">this page</a> of my old website.))> It's my third semester of college. There are two cool creative writing courses offered in January. One of them is a prose memoir course taught by a person who everybody thinks is the coolest creative writing professor ever. The other is course about the graphic novel. The first class fills up very fast, and I don't want to compete for a slot in it, so I sign up for the second. AND THEN MY FATE IS SEALED.</p>

<p>During January, I write the graphic short story <a href="'''+website_base+'''/people-are-wrong-sometimes">People Are Wrong Sometimes</a>, and I think, "Why the hell didn't I get into this medium earlier?" This is the <b>perfect</b> medium for me &ndash; the way I see it, the essence of a work of art is to effectively express an interesting idea, and a graphic narrative combines the abstract expressiveness of language with the instant expressiveness of images, resulting in a storytelling mode that can express ideas so fast that it can almost do justice to the overflowing supply of ideas that's inside my head.</p>

<p>There's just one catch. It takes frickin' ages! To draw that story, I sketched it in pencil, then drew over it in pencil, then drew over it in pen so that it would come out more clearly to the computer, then scanned it into the computer, then touched it up, then colored it in the computer. And when I colored it, I had to manually separate the lines from each other. This is a <em>tragedy</em>. All of those things were possible to automate, and therefore, they should have been automated.</p>

<p>So I'm going to automate them now.</p>

<p>First, a pencil? Seriously? Why would I ever draw something on paper, which has the unique property of <em>being unable to be analyzed and manipulated at the slightest thought</em>, when I could draw in raw data? Step one of my automation is to get a graphics tablet &ndash; a device that lets you draw and have your hand movements be immediately translated into computer data. There's no reason for me to ever deal with physical media in the first place, and having the computer record my drawing means that I can easily mark which lines are which, rather than having to manually separate them afterwards. Of course, this all means that my first task is to do super blitz research on the tablet market and how I can get a bargain on one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I need to research the underlying computer format of the tablet input. Or, at least, I need to find other people's code that can accept the input, so that I can use it for my own work. And I also need to learn more about how to read and write existing image file formats.</p>

<p>Once I have a tablet and figure out how to take input from it, it's just a matter of<footnote((And I make it sound so simple! It is not simple; I just happen to be really, really good at getting my ideas straight, which makes this step the one that I'm most confident about doing well, even though it's probably the most difficult step in abstract terms.))> experimenting with different ways of processing that information until I have ones that are near-perfectly in tune with my internal ways of understanding how I produce art. And creating internal data structures that I can easily manipulate and change when I decide I want to restructure my stuff. This is all going to sound a little abstract until I actually get started on doing it, but trust me, once I get going, I will have awesome powers. AWESOME POWERS.</p>

<p>Wacom is notable not just for being, essentially, <em>the</em> name in graphics tablets, but also for the fact that they're the only major graphics tablet producer that supports Linux-based operating systems. I happen to run a Linux-based OS (namely Ubuntu) on my computer, so that's a necessary feature. There are existing <a href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/">free and open source Linux drivers</a> for Wacom tablets<footnote((Maybe at some point I should also write about why the freedom to dissect and modify the software you use is important, but that's a bit of a daunting task for this post.))>. All other companies that produce tablets, by not having such drivers, have voluntarily rejected my money, which made my choice as a consumer very easy!</p>

<p>(You can tell I'm an expert on the tablet market because I spent a few hours researching it on Google!)</p>

<p>The tablet is supposed to arrive between June 16 and June 21. Since most of the work of this project is in experimentation once I actually receive the tablet, I might be a bit stalled for the next 5-8 days. I guess that gives me plenty of time to learn about file formats &ndash; maybe I should write a program that can load, make simple edits, and save a .png file, as an exercise to make sure I know my stuff.</p>

<p>But that means I need to decide what programming language to write it in! I'd love to write it in Haskell, which is a truly wonderful language, but I haven't written much Haskell code before, and there are a lot fewer existing libraries<footnote((A "library" is a bunch of general-purpose code that can be used in a lot of different projects.

<h3>Part one: Gender</h3>

<p>So, there's this thing called "gender". I wrote a little about it in <a href="'''+website_base+'''/blog/scrutinized-words-she-he">my post about why I use the pronoun "ze" and scrutinize "she" and "he"</a>. Gender is really important, but nobody knows what it is, so I'm going to skip to something that's easier to describe.</p>

<p>So, there's this thing called "sex".<footnote((Actually, there are two things called sex. Here, we're talking about the one that's a physical attribute of humans and most other animals. <a href="'''+website_base+'''/blog/sex">I'll talk about the other one in a different post.</a>))> In the case of humans... well, humans are diverse creatures. Some of them have vaginas, and some don't. Some have penises, and some don't. Some develop lots of facial hair when they reach puberty, some develop breasts, some have their voices deepen... and some don't. By a quirk of biology, most of these attributes are strongly correlated with each other, so we've grouped all the attributes that usually go with each other into two convenient little boxes. There's the box of deep voices, facial hair, and penises (and a bunch of other things), which we call the "male sex", and the box of breasts and vaginas (and a bunch of other things), which we call the "female sex". So if I have a human, and I ask a biologist what sex that human is, then the biologist will look for the attributes from each of those boxes, and if they all fit in the "male" box, the biologist will tell me that the human is male, and so forth. If the human's attributes don't fit neatly into a box, the biologist will give up, go back to zir laboratory, and invent a fancy theory about why not all humans are the way ze expected them to be. But the real reason that not all humans are the way ze expected them to be is that we don't know everything about how humans work yet.<footnote((By the way, the currently accepted term for people whose physical attributes don't fit neatly into a box is "intersex", as in "that person is intersex". Although people don't generally use the term "intersex" to describe people who start out male-sexed or female-sexed and then deliberately alter their bodies to change that.))></p>

<p>When a biologist writes something like "men have greater testosterone levels than women," ze is talking about <strong>sex</strong>.</p>

<p>There's another thing called "subconscious sex". All humans have brains, and brains are really weird. Brains often have strong senses of what is right, or what should happen. It's quite common for a human to have a strong sense of what zir <em>body</em> should be like, and if it's a sense about the attributes that we call "sex", then that sense is called "subconscious sex". Fortunately for most humans, that sense <em>usually</em> matches what their bodies are actually like. Unfortunately, the ones for whom it doesn't are in quite a pickle. Fortunately, we have enough technology to change most of those physical attributes through surgery and hormone supplements. Unfortunately again, those things are expensive, and our social and legal systems are full of discrimination against people who have to do that.</p>

<p>Since neither our society nor our science understands subconscious sex very well, people don't usually talk about it.<footnote((Which is a shame. Remind me to write a post about how not talking about subconscious sex resonates with other neurodiversity issues.))></p>

<p>There's another thing called "assigned gender". When a person gets born, everybody around them usually goes and looks at their genitals and either says "It's a boy!" and starts giving them toy trucks, or says "It's a girl!" and starts giving them dolls and frilly dresses. When they do that, they're assigning the baby a gender; the baby usually doesn't get any choice in the matter. If its genitals don't fit the other people's notions of what male or female genitals look like, then they probably do weird medical tests to decide which they think makes more sense,<footnote((And they often also perform unnecessary surgery to make the baby more like they think it's supposed to be. What a bunch of assholes.))> because they aren't okay with just saying it's not male or female and leaving it at that. Giving people different toys because of what gender you've assigned them is called sexism. Because our society is so sexist, people of different assigned genders often end up experiencing the world in significantly different ways.</p>

<p>When a trans-exclusionary radical feminist says something like "I'm talking about real women &ndash; women who were born and raised as women", ze is talking about <strong>assigned gender</strong>.</p>

<p>There's another thing that I don't know a good name for. (Please tell me if you know a good name for it!) That's the gender that people usually decide you are when they see you. People are usually very stupid, so they look for easy cues to decide gender. Except that usually the cues they look for are physical sex cues, not gender cues; they look for breasts, facial hair, etc., so they're basically trying to decide your sex and they just assume that picking a gender for you based on that is okay. The main exception is that they also look for how long a person's hair is, which doesn't really make any sense because it's really easy to change how long your hair is, regardless of your gender or sex, if you have access to a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>When a person is in a room full of people they don't know and asks something like "who's that girl over there, wearing the fuzzy hat?", ze is talking about <strong>zir immediate gender identification of that person, whatever you want to call it</strong>. I'm going to use the phrases "male-perceived" and "female-perceived" to talk about this concept.</p>

<p>There's another thing called "gender roles". Remember that list of attributes associated with sex? Well, there are also lists of behaviors associated with gender. People usually expect you to do the behaviors associated with the gender they've picked out for you, and a lot of the time, they'll actively or passively discriminate against people who aren't doing them. The main difference between the gender lists and the sex lists is that the sex lists are biological fact, while the gender lists are arrant nonsense. I'm not even going to dirty this blog post by telling you what they are where I come from, because you probably hear about them all the time, and if you haven't heard about them, thank goodness for that!</p>

<p>When someone describes a female-perceived child who plays with male-perceived children at physical sports and games as "one of the boys", ze is talking about <strong>gender roles</strong>.</p>

<p>There's another thing called "gender identity". For one reason or another, some people think they actually <em>are</em> a specific gender, as opposed to just being assigned into it, or doing the activities associated with it, or subconsciously being of the sex associated with it. I haven't got a clue what that means, but it seems to be really important to some people, so I generally acknowledge that it is a thing that exists and is important. There are a lot of things that exist and are important even though I don't know how they work.</p>

<p>When someone refers to a male-identifying person as "she", and ze says something like "dude, I'm a guy", ze is talking about <b>gender identity</b>.</p>

<p>So, have I made my point yet?</p>

<h3>Part one and a half: No I bloody well haven't!</h3>

<p>The thing is, that whole essay about gender and sex and stuff isn't even the original reason I decided to scrutinize these words. I'm not saying it's not a wonderful reason to try to use more specific language, and to avoid overused, ambiguous terms like "woman" and "boy". But that's not the real reason that <em>I</em> have for avoiding those words, and I think it's a weaker reason.</p>

<p>After all, a person could say something like this:</p>

<blockquote>So what if people use those words to mean a lot of different things? Lots of people use lots of words incorrectly every day; that doesn't necessarily mean that you should avoid the words. It means you should use them correctly. And they're useful words, too: Think about how using the terms "trans man" and "trans woman" affirms trans people's identities, in a way that language like "FtM" and "MtF" don't. Your "unambiguous" language would say "trans female-identifying person" or "non-female-assigned female-identifying person", which, to my ear, sound like they're raising a note of skepticism about that identity, rather than affirming it.</blockquote>

<p>Well, okay, hypothetical person. I like what you're saying. But since you're advocating the continued use of the word "man", and you say you can use it in an unambigous way, I'd like to know what exactly you mean when you say "man".</p>

<blockquote>Simple: A person who identifies as male.</blockquote>

<p>So if I'm eight years old, and I say I'm male, then I'm a man?</p>

<blockquote>Oh. Sorry, I meant "An adult who identifies as male".</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Yes, you did. But what the heck is an adult, anyway?</p>

<h3>Part two: Age</h3>

<p>The same way I talked about in <a href="'''+website_base+'''/blog/scrutinized-words-she-he">my post about <q>she</q> and <q>he</q></a>, there are two problems here. One has to do with how we categorize people, and the other has to do with the fact that we chose an overbearing binary categorization system in the first place.</p>

<h4>Passive exclusion</h4>

<p>Suppose I'm addressing an audience, on the topic of feminism, and I say "Women in this country face pervasive discrimination". There are two problems with that sentence. The first problem, of course, is that it's true. The second problem is that there are plenty of people who face the exact same kinds of discrimination I'm talking about, but whom I've left out. Discrimination doesn't magically start when you hit adulthood, so by saying "women", I passively excluded a lot of people.<footnote((You could argue that I'm not obligated to include everyone when I make a statement &ndash; after all, I have already excluded everyone who's not female, and hence left out a lot of people who face much worse gender-based discrimination than the average person who is universally perceived as female. However, if I'm talking about a kind of discrimination that is actually related to their female-perceived-ness, then that exclusion that is necessary to the basic idea of what I'm saying. Excluding people by age has very little to do with what I'm saying, so it is not justified, especially since it's an attack from a position of privilege &ndash; adulthood &ndash; against a group that lacks that privilege.))></p>

<em>I decided to scrutinize these words because I kept catching myself saying things like that.</em>

<p>On a related note, think about the hypothetical person I was talking to. Ze didn't even notice right away when ze said "people" and really meant "adults". That's an easy mistake to make if you've internalized the notion that non-adults aren't really people. Both this and the example from the last paragraph are instances of ageism. Ageism, as you've probably guessed, is active or passive discrimination against people of a marginalized age group. In general, all people who are not yet adults (whatever an adult is) are a marginalized age group. (Ageism also includes discrimination against people who are much older, because of their high age; that's not the subject of this post, but I'd be wrong to leave it out of the definition.)</p>

<h4>Active discrimination</h4>

<p>Okay, now <a href="'''+website_base+'''/blog/scrutinized-words-she-he">go and re-read my post about <q>she</q> and <q>he</q></a>, except this time, replace "she" with "child", "he" with "adult", and "the minority of people who obviously don't fit in the gender binary" with "everyone who lives past the age of twelve". Go on, I'll wait.</p>

<p>When does a person become an adult? What the heck is an adult, anyway? It's just like the whole gender thing: Like gender, it's really, really important in society, and like gender, nobody has a clue what it really means.</p>

<p>As long as "man", "woman", "boy" and "girl" are our primary words for talking about people with genders (or sexes), we're going to have problems. It's not just a problem because it makes it awkward to decide what to say when you're talking about someone who's fourteen years old. It's also a problem because it creates a politics around the age categories. It makes every healthy conversation about gender into a secret nasty conversation about age, and every healthy conversation about age into a secret nasty conversation about gender. Even if you think it's okay to view specific events as coming-of-age events, we have language like "You're a woman now" and "separates the men from the boys" to make it so that you can't just be an adult... you have to be an adult in a gender-binary way! And that's not the only terrible thing it does. Let's look at another specific example:</p>

<p>So, there's this issue of people calling adult female people "girls", all the way up through their forties. Some people say it's bad because it reduces competent, independent adults to children.</p>

<p>Sure, that's bad... <em>if you were thinking of children as "lesser" in the first place.</em></p>

<p>Think about the schoolyard insult "You hit like a girl". It's pretty obvious how sexist that is. It's not sexist because you're telling a male-perceived child that ze's weak; it's sexist because the basic assumption of the statement is that female children suck at hitting because they're female. Of course, it's also an insult, and you shouldn't be insulting people anyway, so it's bascially a really bad idea on both counts. It's a statement that I'd be happy to blast from the language, and never look back.</p>

<p>Now think about the statement that calling an adult a "girl" is infantilizing. It's <em>true</em>, just like it's true that that "You hit like a girl" is an insult. People call adult female people "girls" because they think of female people as lesser and also think of children as lesser. But if you call out the sexism and not the ageism, you're just like the male child who yells back "I do NOT hit like a girl!" and leaves the basic, sexist assumption intact.</p>

<p>Like I said in the <q>she</q>/<q>he</q> post, that's only a symptom of the underlying disease, and the disease is the fact that our language pushes us to judge people based on their age before we make statements about their gender.</p>

<h2>My solution...?</h2>

<p>The easy way to communicate clearly is to say exactly what you mean (or as close as you can manage), and figure out which things you're thinking are true, and which are just convenient assumptions. Let's look at an example: Suppose we're debating abortion rights. Quick, tell me! What group is directly affected by access to abortions?</p>

<p>If you said "women", go find a buzzer so that you can make an annoying buzzing sound to mark your incorrect answer. The group affected is <i>people with functioning uteruses</i>. A lot of people with functioning uteruses aren't adults, and not all people with functioning uteruses are female-identifying. Of course, there's nothing stopping you from talking about how sexism affects legal abortion rights campaigns because of the strong correlation between functioning uteruses and female gender roles, <em>once you acknowledge that,</em> and by saying <i>people with functioning uteruses</i>, you have neatly avoided all the passively ageist and cissexist language. It's a lot of syllables, I know, but if worst comes to worst and you have to say it over and over again, you could always come up with a shorthand for it or something.</p>

<p>A few syllables is a small price to pay for a healthy society.</p>

<p>Also, I should have mentioned this yesterday: I <em>did</em> go on to rewrite my little exercise in Haskell. The exercise takes an image, messes with it, saves it to a file, draws it on the screen thirty times over the course of fifteen seconds, and exits. You can look at my <a href="/TODO/files/sdl_exercise_1.cpp">C++ source code</a> and <a href="/TODO/files/sdl_exercise_1.hs">Haskell source code</a>. They're almost exactly the same. Both consist of a quick wrapper around the SDL_Surface manipulation and a list of SDL commands to execute. Neither does much error checking. The Haskell one has significantly fewer lines, but they're about the same in file size. When I ran them, I used my avatar image from this site as the image to mess with. It looked pretty cool.</p>

<p>I was a little surprised at how easily I could write the Haskell code, although maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised, since I've been studying it for a while (not to mention that I'm a very fast learner). Since I love Haskell so much, I'm probably going to stick to it.</p>

<p>Sometime when I'm not so tired, I'm going to write a programming-101 post about C++, Haskell, and why Haskell is so much more awesome. When I say "programming 101", I mean that I hope it will be accessible to people who don't do computer programming &ndash; but as with my posts about gender, I believe that introducing basic concepts before expanding on them is <em>also</em> the most effective way to communicate even with people who are already feminists / computer programmers. It makes what I'm saying be more grounded, more clear, and more precise.</p>

<p>Oh, and also &ndash; I have shipping information on my tablet now. The best estimate is that it will arrive June 21, which gives me an entire week to get used to Haskell programming. I think I'm going to try to port my 2D collision-detection library from C++ to Haskell. Or maybe write a cute Haskell/OpenGL game. Or both. Watch me.</p>

<p>Ahem. This will be a policy of my website. I intend to make my website appropriate for all ages of viewers, or at least, all ages that are likely to be able to use a web browser. Being appropriate for children implies a lot of different things, so I'm making this post to outline the most important ones.</p>

<p><strong>#1. Words like "fuck" and "shit"<footnote((By the way, if you're a child, and the people around you have been <em>rude</em> enough not to tell you what "fuck" and "shit" mean, you can find good descriptions on the Wikipedia pages for them &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck">fuck</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit">shit</a>.))> are totally acceptable here, because nothing's worse for children than censorship.</strong></p>

<p>This is hardly the most important rule, but it's a good one to set the tone of this post. Being child-friendly means treating children with respect; it means treating them as independent human beings. When an adult tells you not to say certain words, that adult is not respecting you. Ze is saying that zir own opinion is more important than yours. Even if the adult lets you say what you want, but avoids "bad" words around you (and by the way, there's nothing <em>bad</em> about swearing), the adult is doing that for zir own benefit, not yours. Ze is trying to influence what you say and think, because ze thinks you're more "innocent" that way. That's not helpful; it's patronizing, and condescending.</p>

<p>We live in a world where adults tell outright <em>lies</em> to children because they think it's <em>cute</em>.<footnote((The lie I'm thinking of is Santa Claus. A lot of adults tell children that there's a person, called Santa Claus, who lives at the North Pole and gives them presents for Christmas. It's as ridiculous as it sounds.))> I'm not going to participate in that.</p>

<p>I admit that choosing whether or not to swear isn't a very important issue. So let's move on to an issue that is very, very important:</p>

<p><strong>#2. I will talk openly about <a href="'''+website_base+'''/blog/sex">sex and sexuality</a> here.</strong></p>

<p>This guideline (and the rest of them, really) is not just a child-friendliness issue; it's a human-friendliness issue. Most of the dominant cultures of the world are extremely sexually repressed; they don't talk about sex, they try to push sex-related information out of sight, and they even try to make people feel guilty for <em>thinking</em> about sex. Because of these things, when people actually <em>do</em> sexual stuff, they generally do it in a really bad way that's stressful for everyone involved. The only way you could make it worse would be by throwing everyone into teenage sexuality completely unprepared... which is exactly what we do by not talking to children about it.</p>

<p>A lot of people try to stop children from seeing anything that has anything to do with sexuality. They do this because they think it will "protect" children, but in fact, it does the exact opposite, by denying them access to information that is extremely important for them to have. It is also important for the information people can get about sexuality to emphasize consent, communication, and acceptance, rather than taboos and social power games.</p>

<p>I should also mention that children <em>do</em> often have sexual behaviors of their own, even before puberty. Adults often cause a lot of harm to children by trying to suppress this.</p>

<p><strong>#3. I will avoid saying things in a way that demeans, insults, or ignores people who are younger than I am.</strong></p>

<p>I wrote a lot about this in the second half of <a href="'''+website_base+'''/blog/scrutinized-words-man-woman-boy-girl">this post</a>; I don't have too much more to say about it here.</p>

<p>A lot of parts of our society are designed in a way that pointlessly excludes children, because the adults who designed them were only thinking about adults. Whenever you use language that demeans children, like using "childish" as an criticism or saying that you deserve privacy or respect because you're an "adult", you're saying that children aren't <em>really</em> people, and they shouldn't really have the same rights other people do. This adds to the patterns of thought that make people ignore accessibility to children. I don't think it should happen; I believe that if something is intended for the public, it should be &ndash; as much as it can be &ndash; accessible to <em>all</em> the public, regardless of their age, physical disability, or any other attribute.</p>

<p><strong>#4. I will try to write in a way that is clear and easy to understand. I will avoid making unnecessary cultural references. I will not assume that my readers have much prior knowledge of most subjects.</strong></p>

<p>Whee! Finally one that isn't completely against what most adults think being "child-friendly" is about!</p>

<p>Technically speaking, this isn't purely a child-friendliness issue, because many children are highly knowledgeable can read complicated text, and many adults aren't. However, adults <em>usually</em> have more knowledge and can read more easily than children, so if I want to make sure my website is accessible to children, I need to consider that. This guideline is also here to help adults who aren't native English speakers and are only just learning; it's also to help adults who have mental disabilities that prevent them from reading complex text... and so on. If I assume that a person already knows something, and I'm wrong, then I have communicated badly. Since I'm on the Internet, where almost anyone can read what I write, I should avoid assuming <em>any</em> knowledge that I don't have to.</p>

<p>In some of my posts, like when I write about computer programming, I have to assume a lot of knowledge in order to be able to say anything about the subject. In those cases, I will try to put a note at the beginning of each post saying what knowledge it assumes.</p>

<p>I have a lot of things to say, and I think most people would benefit from reading my posts. It wouldn't be very nice for me to write them in a way that's inconvenient for some people.</p>

<p>This post is intended to be accessible to people who don't know anything about computer programming. If you already know a lot about computer programming, you might want to <a href="#cppvhaskell1_into_the_personal">skip to the last section of this post</a> where I talk about what I'm doing now.</p>

<p>Computers calculate things. They're very good at it. But to get a computer to calculate something, you need to know how to control the computer. If you're a computer programmer, that means having a program called a "compiler" or "interpreter" that takes things you write in "programming languages" and converts them into a form that the computer can use. C++ and Haskell are both programming languages, but they work in significantly different ways.</p>

<p>I can't just say "Computer, tell me all the prime numbers between 2 and 100", because the computer doesn't understand English. But I CAN open up a Haskell prompt and say:</p>

<pre class="code">[x | x <- [2..100], not . any (\y -> x `mod` y == 0) $ [2..(x-1)]]</pre>

<p>That's valid Haskell code. It says "Get me the list of all numbers between 2 and 100 which are not divisible by any of the numbers less than them", and it pretty much says it in that order, too. This is a really short program because Haskell is designed to be a very "high level" language. I'll get to what that means in the next paragraph. But first, let's look at how I could do the same thing in C++:</p>

<pre class="code">std::vector&lt;int&gt; primes;
for (int x = 2; x <= 100; ++x) {
  bool x_is_prime = true;
  for (int y = 2; y < x; ++y) {
    if ((x % y) == 0) {
      x_is_prime = false;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (x_is_prime) {
    primes.push_back(x);
  }
}
return primes;</pre>

<p>Augh! It's fourteen lines instead of one! It's more than three times as long even if you only count letters in the most generous way! At this point you should be saying <q><acronym title="What the fuck?">WTF?</acronym> Why would anyone use C++?</q>.</p>

<p>Well, C++ is a "low level" language. There's a low-to-high continuum, with different languages falling in different places; Haskell is at the extreme high end, and C++ is mid-to-low. High level languages are designed to be a lot like human languages; they're supposed to be natural ways to express ideas. Low level languages, on the other hand, are designed to be a lot like the underlying machine code; they're supposed to give you better control over how the computer processes the information. That's very important if you're writing a program that's going to take a lot of processing power, because if you write high-level code that doesn't consider how it's going to be computed, then you may end up doing things in a very inefficient way. So it makes sense that the code I've written is more verbose in C++; when I compile either of those pieces of code into the underlying "machine language", the Haskell code becomes just as long as the C++ code &ndash; I could write it more concisely, at the cost of having less control over exactly what it became.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what if I don't care? In the last ten years, computers have gotten ridiculously fast. Like, RIDICULOUSLY fast. I feel like as long as I don't write an advanced physics simulator, or graphics code, or pointlessly waste calculations, then everything I write will execute in less than a millisecond without me having to do anything about it.</p>

<p>There's another important difference between C++ and Haskell: C++ is an "imperative" language and Haskell is a "functional" language. Imperative languages are essentially a series of commands for the computer: Go here, add these numbers together, stop, display it on the screen, go back and compute some more numbers. This makes sense for low-level languages because that's exactly how a computer works: It has a processing unit that executes simple commands, one after the other.<footnote((Well, modern computers often have multiple processors that work in parallel. And the computers of the future will probably embrace parallel processing even more. But the basic idea is still pretty similar.))> (There are also some high-level imperative languages, but in general, imperative languages are lower-level than functional languages.)</p>

<p>Functional languages like Haskell are different: They don't say "Do this to that". They say "This <strong>is</strong> that". If you want to put it in English terms, my C++ code says "Compute the list of all primes from 2 to 100 and return it", while the Haskell code just says "The list of all primes from 2 to 100". Of course, that can be kind of confusing because, hey, the computer does stuff, doesn't it? Like, right now, your computer is showing you this blog post. It hadn't always showed you this blog post, so if I never told the computer to do something, then how would you ever see anything? I mean, C++ can say "Draw a window, then display stuff until the user quits, then close the window", but what can Haskell do?</p>

<p>Well, the answer is that a Haskell program says something like "The output of this program <strong>is</strong> to draw a window on the screen and display the input the user asks for until the user quits". And I think that's pretty awesome. I don't have to worry "Do these commands make the computer do what I want it to do?" because in Haskell, I didn't write "do these commands", I wrote "this is what I want". And that's in addition to the fact that Haskell code is so much shorter, which makes it easier to read and makes there be fewer opportunities to mess up.</p>

<h2 id="cppvhaskell1_into_the_personal">Into the personal...</h2>

<p>A while ago, I wrote a 2D collision detection library in C++. That's a piece of code that simulates a bunch of objects moving around, and detects when they crash into each other. This is an important thing for computer games. Unfortunately, there's no simple way of doing it that doesn't waste lots of processor power when there are a lot of objects. So, without going into too much detail for the moment &ndash; this piece of code was <em>really complicated</em>.</p>

<p>In the last couple of days, I've been trying to rewrite it in Haskell, with varied success. Some parts of it translate over really easily and are much, much more readable in Haskell than they were in C++. Other parts aren't so easy to deal with. Because writing in Haskell is so much about getting your conceptual understanding right, and the C++ version really was too complicated for me to get a good conceptual understanding, I'm having trouble rebuilding it. And it would take a huge, epic blog post just to explain how it works, much less explain the issues with rewriting it. I'm not even sure if it would have the speed it needs if I wrote it in Haskell; I was mainly doing it as an exercise, and it was a good exercise, even if I got stuck on it.</p>

<p>Well, not to worry. I've only ever written one complete program in Haskell, or in <em>any</em> functional language, and it takes a lot of practice to get into functional programming when you're only familiar with imperative programming. I was lucky to have written this website in Python, which has a bunch of functional-programming-like features, even some that it borrows directly from Haskell. That made me familiar with some of the concepts before I jumped in, but still, it's not really that easy to write an extremely sophisticated program after only a few days!</p>

<p>So, for the moment, I'm going to step back and write a cute little game in Haskell instead.</p>

<p>So, I was thinking about this game I'm writing. I mostly only have vague ideas at this point, but it's going to be one of those games where you control a human and walk/fly/whatever around exploring the world and fighting various enemies. And maybe you'll find various equipment &ndash; different weapons and armor that you can switch around.</p>

<p>I'm a mathematician, so I love generalizing things. So I looked at the switching-around system and said "How much can I generalize this?" And so I immediately thought of allowing you, the player, to switch off your arms and legs and replace them with robot arms and legs, or use cool bio-technology to give yourself tentacles instead. And you can't really have a "switch one thing for another" system unless you can switch one thing for nothing. Maybe you could take off your arms and sell them in a shop? Sounds ridiculous, but I've definitely played games where you can do things like that!</p>

<p>But anyway, the real thing I want to talk about isn't taking off your arms, it's just taking off your <em>clothing</em>, which has a lot of different social implications, for some damn reason.</p>

<p>So I've got a choice. Do I allow the player to have zir character take off all zir clothes,<footnote((Assuming ze was wearing any in the first place. I think it's pretty cool to give the player complete freedom of choice by not sending them into the game with clothes already chosen for them, but that's a different issue.))> or don't I?</p>

<p>Suppose I do. Then I take a nice walk into the wonderful world of sexual exploitation! According to the stereotype, the people who will use this feature are mostly horny teenage male people who are sexually attracted to female people.<footnote((Well, that wouldn't happen if the character never looks female. But if the character is always male, that's just the same old male-as-default sexism that's been around for ages; I'm not going to do it. I suppose I could make the character always be androgynous, but recently, I've been deciding that it's a better idea to show diversity than to gloss over it.))> Most people from the real world would be creeped out by the idea of a super-powerful being from another reality staring at them when they're naked, so it would be reasonable to assume that the character doesn't like it either.<footnote((Well, not really. There's plenty of people in real life who are totally okay with other people looking at them in a sexual way, so it wouldn't be reasonable to assume that everybody isn't. But saying "Maybe the character is okay with it!" is a pedantic excuse.))> Which means that the player who does that is taking advantage of zir character; it's simulated voyeurism, and voyeurism is pretty icky.</p>

<p>Okay, that sounds bad. Suppose I don't do it. Then I enter the wonderful world of prudishness! I live in a society where nudity is a taboo; that social norm applies to most of the developed world, so statistically, since you're using the Internet, it's probably true where you are too. And it's really bad. Suppressing nudity, and suppressing depictions of nudity, makes people uncomfortable with their bodies. <em>The fact that I am writing this post in the first place</em> is because we think it's a big deal when someone isn't wearing any clothes. If people didn't think that being naked was inherently sexual, then the "sexual exploitation" thing wouldn't even be an issue. So if I design a game that could easily have the characters be naked, but <em>doesn't</em>, then I'm actively contributing to our taboos, and making the problem even worse &ndash; including the very problem that I described in the last paragraph!</p>

<p>Aaaaaaarrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhh!!!!!</p>

<p>Okay, time to settle down a bit.</p>

<p>The two opinions I just wrote are pretty standard opinions that apply to a lot of things. Look at advertisements on TV and the Internet. A lot of them have sexually suggestive pictures of female-sexed, femininity-performing people who aren't wearing very much clothing. It's pretty terrible, because of the way it makes female bodies into something that's for sale, which makes some people look at female-bodied people more as objects than people, and so on. So there's a strong temptation to look at it, say "This is pretty terrible; let's fix it by doing the exact opposite!", and then try to fix it by going on a crusade to eliminate all female nudity. Which is equally terrible, because when you do <em>that</em>, you're suppressing the sexuality of a lot of female-anythinged people, and making them just as self-conscious about their bodies as they were when they were exposed to the mass of supposedly-perfect-looking images of their sex/gender/whatever on TV and the Internet!<footnote((I'm being a bit careless about dividing sex from gender here, because different people have entirely different ways of responding to social pressure, even within the same sex and/or the same gender, so anything I say about this is a vague generalization that applies to some people and not others.))> Oh, and it makes people who think they're perceived as male be totally uncomfortable about expressing <em>their</em> sexual attraction, too.</p>

<p>There's a lot of issues that have similar temptations. Here's another example: Suppose I'm writing a story with a powerful, evil, controlling character. Suppose the character is male, cis, and generally gender-comforming. That's annoying because it's the cultural default &ndash; big surprise, it's another male person in control. I'm representing male people as being in control and female people (assuming there are female characters ze's manipulating) as being weak or powerless. So, suppose I decide I'll make the evil character be female instead. Then it gets worse! Because there are <em>also</em> stereotypes about female people being evil and controlling. Instead of being an "Oh jeez a man is in charge" story, it's a "You'd better watch out &ndash; don't put a woman in charge!" story. And if I make the character be androgynous, or a robot, or whatever, then it becomes an anti-androgyne or anti-robot story.</p>

<p>That's not a unique example. That kind of thing happens basically whenever you write a story that has people with genders in it. This sounds like a job for...<footnote((<q>Sounds like a job for</q> is a cultural reference to the line "This sounds like a job for... Superman!". I said I'd avoid unnecessary cultural references, but in this case, the line has the same meaning regardless of whether you get the reference. On the other hand, most people will probably read this footnote, which wastes lots of extra time, and maybe therefore means that making the reference had a bad effect after all!))></p>

<p>DIVERSITY!</p>

<p>Yeah, you can have the same story, except put a lot of other characters in it that contradict the same stereotypes. Like I could have the evil male dominator, and also have an evil female dominator. Or I could have just the evil female dominator and have a secondary female character who has a lot of authority and uses it well. Or I could make there be a lot going on in the character's life that makes you sympathize with zem and not think of zem as a stereotype, even if you still don't like the way ze's all evil and stuff.</p>

<p>On the other hand, that doesn't solve my original problem from this post.</p>

<p>On the third hand, my original problem is easy to solve. If I write the game in a way where it fits,<footnote((Which I probably won't, because I don't have nearly enough time to write the whole game before my tablet arrives and I start doing the graphics stuff instead.))> then I'll have the nudity in it. Problem solved!</p>

<p>All we need is a slightly different perspective on the objectification issue. A game is just a way for you to imagine stuff, and it's ridiculous to say that a person can't imagine all the naked, sexually available people ze wants to, within the privacy of zir own head. A game isn't responsible for people's sexual objectification of female people, unless the game is designed in a way that especially encourages it. In fact, by having the characters in my game appear with a variety of different human body types and skin colors, I could be <em>improving</em> the overall social justice of their sexual fantasies!</p>

<p>Plus, there are lots of good reasons to allow naked characters. Like, because it's totally awesome to go around kicking ass without wearing anything, regardless of your gender or sex, and games are a vehicle for imagining that you <em>are</em> the character in the game. And because it's a challenge, if the clothing in the game is actually useful for anything. In the game <i>Nethack</i>, one of the fun ways to restrict your play is the "naked" challenge &ndash; try to win the game without ever wearing any clothing or equipment.<footnote((Of course, <i>Nethack</i> doesn't have a graphical display, just text, so it avoids the issue of whether to <em>display</em> nudity.))></p>

<p>That's one difficult question answered, I guess. I like having answers to difficult questions!</p>

<p>(This post is mostly a long rant about my computing woes. Feel free to skim over it.)</p>

<p>The linuxwacom project website says most modern Linux distributions come with Wacom tablet input drivers already enabled. Ubuntu is supposed to be included in this. So I look around on my system, and sure enough, there's already a package installed that's called xserver-xorg-input-wacom. So I plug in my tablet and try using it. Does it work? Nope!</p>

<p>So I download the linuxwacom drivers manually. I have to install a lot new stuff that they rely on. That's pretty normal. One of the things they need is the latest version of xorg-macros. I check on my system, and I have 1.3. I check my package manager, and sure enough, there's an update available, so I update to 1.5. Wait a minute... linuxwacom needs 1.8! And Ubuntu's "current version" is 1.5!</p>

<p>PIECES OF SHIT COUNTER</p><ol><li>Ubuntu</li></ol>

<p>So I download and install that, manually, which isn't very difficult, just annoying. And I finish installing linuxwacom, and then restart my computer and... YES! The tablet actually works at giving input equivalent to mouse cursor input. So I go and open up some graphics-editing programs that I know are supposed to accept tablet input &ndash; GIMP and Inkscape &ndash; and sure enough, they also accept tablet input for themselves. Nice!</p>

<p>ACTUALLY DECENT SOFTWARE COUNTER</p><ol><li>linuxwacom</li></ol>

<p>And then I spend about 15 minutes messing around in GIMP.</p>

<img alt="A stylized drawing of a person charging with a sword or something, out of a bright, open doorway." src="'''+website_base+'''/media/15_minutes_of_messing_around_with_my_new_tablet_in_GIMP.png" style="width:100%" />

<p>Messing around in GIMP is pretty nice. GIMP is a bit like a canvas: You can draw on it with a variety of "tools", and you have the extra advantage of being able to undo your actions, but the internal substance is just that: The pixels on the screen. Inkscape is different: Inkscape records ideal approximations of the paths you draw, and you can go back and edit those paths later. So, essentially, GIMP is for <em>drawing</em> pictures and Inkscape is for <em>designing</em> pictures. But I want to be able to draw <em>and</em> design pictures, so neither really has the feature-set that I want, and since I'm probably going to be using this medium a lot, for a long time, I want to have absolute control over my own abilities; both Inkscape and GIMP have a lot of configuration options, but they aren't nearly as versatile as they could be if I had direct control at the source level. I need to write my own programs.</p>

<p>So I look at the source code of GIMP and Inkscape, to see how they use tablet input. Their source code is incredibly complicated and confusing, and doesn't have good documentation. Both of them are built using GTK, a graphical-user-interface library. I ask the Internet about GTK tablet input, and it says that GTK has some long-standing, significant bugs relating to tablet input, which haven't been fixed for some reason. Plus, what I <em>want</em> to do (for the moment) is just add tablet input to an existing program, and using GTK for that would be like buying a giant toolbox just to use a screwdriver.</p>

<p>PIECES OF SHIT COUNTER</p><ol><li>Ubuntu</li><li>GTK</li></ol>

<p>So I go to Google and search for information about how to use tablet input in C++ programs. I use a lot of combinations of the following search terms: tablet, wacom, input, c++, programming, linux... But if you search for "tablet" you get information about tablet PCs, and if you don't search for "linux" then you only get info about how to do it on Windows, and if you <em>do</em> search for "linux" then you only get information about linuxwacom, which is just the driver. And if you search for "c" or "c++" then you get information about parts of linuxwacom that are written in C, and if you search for "input" then you get lots of pages about how to set up Wacom tablet input from the user-end perspective, which I've already done, but if you don't search for "input" then you don't get the right information! I did discover that there's, apparently, a fairly simple system for getting tablet input in Haskell, but I don't want to use Haskell for this stage of the project; I'll be saying "Go screw with this" and Haskell will say "Excuse me, I'm sure you mean 'Please show me the results of executing this list of screwing operations'". Haskell just isn't a good language for doing stupid stuff in!</p>

<p>You know what's another interesting thing about a Google search for Haskell tablet input? <em>This website is in the first page of Google results.</em> Which is... kinda flattering, but completely useless to me!</p>

<p>PIECES OF SHIT COUNTER</p><ol><li>Ubuntu</li><li>GTK</li><li>Google</li></ol>

<p>Okay, so I've been using SDL. SDL has its own event system, which gives you mouse and keyboard input and stuff; let's see if it has a way to get tablet input. So I go to Google again and ask it about SDL tablet input. Turns out, SDL has no built-in way of accepting tablet input. Yuck! On the other hand, it is supposed to have a way to ask the X Window Manager for its own events. And I know X is receiving my tablet events, because X is the entity that makes it function as a mouse. (Also I checked with the utility program "xev".) So I spend another few hours looking up what X events are and how they're stored, and I finally find some convenient example code that reads the X events directly. And so I compile that code, and IT WORKS. YES!</p>

<p>So then I go back and try to include that in my SDL code, by using SDL's "SYSWMEVENT" construct (short for system window manager event; it is supposed to cover every kind of event that SDL doesn't cover by default). I successfully enable SYSWMEVENTS... but it doesn't work at all, because SDL only reports MOUSEMOTION events for my tablet input, not any SYSWMEVENTS.</p>

<p>PIECES OF SHIT COUNTER</p><ol><li>Ubuntu</li><li>GTK</li><li>Google</li><li>SDL</li></ol>

<p>Okay, that doesn't seem like TOO much of a setback, because I already have this code that takes the input, so I can just use it <em>and</em> SDL, even if that seems kind of stupid. So I try that. It seems to work pretty well! The only problem is, the position of the cursor in the window isn't the same as the coordinates that the tablet gives. SDL mouse motion events give you coordinates based in the window &ndash; the top left corner of the window is (0, 0) &ndash; but X events give you coordinates based on the screen size, where the top left corner of the <em>screen</em> is (0, 0). That shouldn't be too hard to deal with, though, because all I have to do is subtract the window's position within the screen, and then I get the position I want.</p>

<p>It turns out that SDL has no way of knowing where its window is.</p>

<p>PIECES OF SHIT COUNTER</p><ol><li>Ubuntu</li><li>GTK</li><li>Google</li><li>SDL</li><li>SDL</li></ol>

<p>(And I can't compute it based on the difference between the SDL event coordinates and the X event coordinates, because the events don't come at exactly the same times.)</p>

<p>I guess I'm gonna ditch SDL. But first, I think I'm going to take a break. I've spent the better part of two days trying to work around the fact that I have to deal with shitty, badly documented systems, and that's pretty stressful, so I should probably take a break from it. (Be glad it didn't take you two days to read this rant!)</p>

<p>Maybe I'll work on my little game some more, or start cutting into my TODO list for this website.</p>

<p>I had to take a break from my coding and blogging for the last few days because of a hurting thumb. It still hurts somewhat, but I've become proficient at typing without using that thumb. In the meantime, I spent my two-day break reading <i>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</i>, a work of fan fiction based on the <i>Harry Potter</i> series.</p>

<p>(The rest of this post will assume general knowledge of the plot of <i>Harry Potter</i>, but does not contain spoilers.)</p>

<p>TV Tropes describes <i>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</i> (abbreviated HP:MoR) as "an Alternate Universe story, where Petunia married a scientist." Instead of being completely awestruck by the wizarding world after having been abused<footnote((Although I hesitated to use the term. The way Harry's aunt and uncle treat zem in the <i>Harry Potter</i> series, if taken literally, is abusive, but the series treats it as a joke or caricature, and Harry is depicted more as a blank slate than as someone dealing with the aftermath of that kind of treatment. I explored this more when I wrote <a href='''+website_base+'''/voldemorts-children>Voldemort's Children</a>.))> at the hands of zir relatives, Harry Potter has been raised in a healthy environment and taught the virtues of the scientific method, and walks into the wizarding world intending to apply science to magic and transform the world. To put it a different way, ze tries all the things that made me frustrated at the original Harry when ze <em>didn't</em> try them. It also answers a lot of the annoying questions that the original series overlooks in order to write a morally-unambiguous<footnote((Yes, the good guys are not always good and the bad guys are not always bad, and Harry has to discover that. None of that changes the fact that it's written as a story where good guys fight bad guys and the good guys win.))> adventure story. In short, it's a beautiful work of deconstruction, and <strong>also</strong> a great attempt to educate the reader about the scientific method and common fallacies. And also a hilarious parody of the original.</p>

<p>However, I do have some reservations about recommending it. Like any work of deconstruction, it still has all the flaws of the original story <em>except</em> for the ones it specifically takes away. Like the fact that Harry Potter, the character, is a white, male, cis, able-bodied, heterosexual, upper-class, neurotypical person, in a way that treats all those attributes as the default, the "normal" attribute, and the opposite as unusual.<footnote((A brief note about the original series &ndash; trans people and non-heterosexual people don't exist in the story as written, and for the few neurodivergent people (Voldemort, Luna, Trelawney...) we only get the outsider's perspective that they're "weird" or "cool" or "completely evil", rather than seeing their own perspectives or challenges. Like Hermione, and like Rowling's public claim that Dumbledore is gay, they're A Lesson for members of the dominant class (<q>Hey you! You'd better believe it's okay for people to be Different!</q>) but they are not role models and they do not tell our stories. J. K. Rowling also seems to believe that Love is the most important thing in the world and it's everyone's deepest emotion, which is (guess what?) not true in the real world.))> HP:MoR Harry is not quite as much like that &ndash; ze's arguably not neurotypical, and the story treats adults' age-discrimination as a serious issue &ndash; but the rest is still there, and I'm a little tired of the "genius protagonist" being always male. In general, HP:MoR has upgraded a lot of the male characters from <i>Harry Potter</i> while leaving female characters the same, downgrading them, or putting them in victim roles. It does seem to be trying in some places to deliver a feminist message, but it fails horribly. I wouldn't normally recommend something with that much sexism. And Harry treats the 17th-century European "Enlightenment" as the only source of rationality in the world, or of belief in human rights, which is kinda unfair to all the philosophers of the rest of the world.</p>

<p>And finally &ndash; if you have triggers, READ THE TRIGGER WARNINGS. Unlike the original series, HP:MoR does NOT gloss over the more horrible things in the world.</p>

<p>I made progress again on my graphics editing stuff; I have a program that takes tablet input and converts it into individual lines/strokes. That task was surprisingly easy; once again, I'm a bit unsure of what to do next.</p>

<p>So I just set myself a specific task: <em>Create the software that I would want to use to write <a href="'''+website_base+'''/people-are-wrong-sometimes">People Are Wrong Sometimes</a> if I'd written it with this instead of on paper.</em></p>

<p>Which of course raises the question "What do I need for that?". So I looked over <i>People Are Wrong Sometimes</i> from a conceptual perspective, turning the question into "What are the things in it?".</p><ol><li>Lines (straight or curved), of varying colors.</li><li>Fields bounded by straight/curved lines, of varying colors.</li><li>Text</li></ol>

<p>I already have the concept of <strong>lines</strong>.</p>

<p>One interesting thing that I notice about the lines is that they almost <em>never</em> cross; usually, one line is cut off by another (e.g. panel borders cut off the image, speech bubbles obscure objects in the panel, and some objects or people are in front of others...). In my pencil and pen drawings, I had to carefully end each line where the next began. In my computer programs, I should have a way to automatically have one line cut off another, which means I need the concept of <strong>where lines cross</strong>. And, on a related note, I should have a way to automatically detect when I've surrounded a region completely, so that region can be filled with color.</p>

<p>For the moment, I'm going to ignore the text. I like the way I used a variety of different typefaces in <i>People Are Wrong Sometimes</i>, but I don't like the way I was relying on pre-existing typefaces that didn't necessarily fit the overall visual style of the piece, and I don't like the fact that I didn't have precise control over the size and flow of the text. On the other hand, I definitely wouldn't like to write all the text myself; my hands hurt if I write for long periods of time, and my handwriting isn't very good. I've heard that some artists draw their own typefaces (where since you only have to draw each letter once or twice, you can spend a lot of time getting it right); I might want to do that, but it's something for later.</p>

<p>In the writing process of <i>People Are Wrong Sometimes</i>, I drew a lot of sketches; I sketched out everything in pencil first, with a lot of experimenting and erasing, then drew over it in pencil to decide exactly what I wanted, then drew over it in pen and erased the pencil marks before scanning it. In the computer, I'll need that same leeway to draw and redraw, so I need a concept of <strong>selective erasing</strong>. And I'm going to need to be able to erase one line without erasing another that's very close to it. Internally, the lines are all going to be numbered, but in my user-interface, I'm going to need a way to refer to them without typing in numbers all the time. Maybe that could be accomplished just by zooming in (and having a mode<footnote((And when I say "mode", I probably mean a key that I hold down while drawing. Holding a key with one hand while drawing with the other might be inconvenient, but it's a lot less inconvenient than accidentally leaving the mode on and then trying to draw a real line. The book <i>The Humane Interface</i> calls hold-down-a-key modes "quasimodes", and recommends them highly.))> where I use the tablet-pen as an eraser.)</p>

<p>I'm also going to want a really sophisticated <strong>undo</strong> system, for when I make mistakes &ndash; INCLUDING mistakenly undoing things. My current plan is to store a complete record of all operations (like drawing a line or changing a line's color) on an image, including undo operations, and have it be theoretically possible to re-construct the image from nothing just by going through all the operations. And have them be discrete/separable enough that you could go back and "undo" individual long-ago operations without having it interfere with the rest of the chain. But of course, doing that would be simply adding an "undo" instruction to the <em>end</em> of the chain. The advantage of this system is that it makes me automatically able to go back to <em>any</em> version of the image, even dead-end versions that I didn't like at the time and undid. I'm going to want to have the operation-log be displayed on-screen, along with the actual image, and have various features that let you mess with the image from that perspective.</p>

<p>I also need to be able to move, zoom, and rotate the drawing field.</p>

<p>Some things that I could have used, but (deliberately) didn't use in <i>People Are Wrong Sometimes</i> are: Continuous shading, texture/pattern, significantly-varied line weight... it was, very explicitly, constructed out of the concepts of line and field, rather than being constructed as marks on paper. I like drawing in that way; remind me to make a post about how drawing can be done from an abstract/conceptual communication perspective, just as much as writing can.</p>

<p>(This post assumes a certain amount of knowledge about math.)</p>

<p>I think it's really cheesy to do something on June 28 just because the decimal expansion of &tau; begins "6.28...", but well, I might as well do it today as any day.</p>

<p>If you've studied mathematics in the modern world, you've probably run into a number called <em>pi</em>, or &pi;, which represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. That's weird and confusing, because pretty much every other mathematical concept about circles is based on the <em>radius</em> of the circle, not its diameter. The diameter is exactly twice the radius, so lots of formulas involving &pi; end up referring to the quantity 2&pi;.</p>

<p>This is pretty silly, becuase the "2" in "2&pi;" doesn't really mean anything. It's just a correction factor to make up for the fact that the number we're calling "&pi;" is exactly half of what the natural value for the circle constant is. That leads to confusing things like the fact that rotating by &pi; radians is a <em>half</em>-rotation, not a full rotation... and if you want to rotate by three-quarters of a circle, you have to rotate by 3&pi;/2, which is completely confusing.</p>

<p>So, a lot of mathematicians, including myself, are now using a new name for the quantity "2&pi;" &ndash; namely, <em>tau</em>, or &tau;. Its value is approximately 6.283185307..., hence the cheesy date of June (the sixth month) 28.</p>

<p>Society is full of myths and lies about sex &ndash; about what it means to have sex, about when you should have sex, about who should be having sex, about how many people you should have sex with, and so forth. In fact, there are <em>so many</em> myths and lies that I can't possibly address them all, or even a representative sample of them, in one post. There are the traditional, Puritanical lies (<q>You should never do anything sexual except with your spouse in a heterosexual marriage</q>), and you'd <em>hope</em> that there'd be a counterculture that rejects them... and indeed there is, but it only rejects them to set up its own system of myths and lies, like "You should always have sex before your third date"<footnote((Which assumes that you were dating in the first place, which I could write an entire rant about separately.))>. In short, no matter who you ask, someone is going to tell you how <em>they</em> think <em>you</em> should live your life.</p>

<p>There are so many problems with this that if I pointed out any <em>three</em> of them individually, I'd feel guilty for not pointing out all the rest.<footnote((Actually, I wouldn't feel guilty; I'm not sure "guilt" is a feeling I ever experience. But I would feel like my essay was not doing as effective a job as I wanted it to be doing.))> So I'm going to throw that all out and start over from the beginning.</p>

<h2>What the fuck is sex, anyway?</h2>

<p>Humans are strange creatures with strange feelings. I could mention a bunch of terms like "sexual attraction", "sexual arousal", "sexual release", "lust", "orgasm"... But if I tried to describe sex in terms of those things, I'd be writing a circular definition. Imagine you don't know what any of those terms mean, but still have sexual feelings yourself: How could you identify them with the words? After all, a person can enjoy the appearance of another's body in a non-sexual way; ze can be physically excited in a non-sexual way, satisfied in a non-sexual way...</p>

<p>A lot of definitions try to start by saying that sexual feeling is something associated with your genitals, but that's not a good place to base the definition. There are plenty of ways to be sexual that don't involve genitals, and plenty of things to do with your genitals that aren't sexual (peeing comes to mind). And there are people who don't even <em>have</em> genitals who still have sexual feelings, so it's going to be really hard to find a way to clearly define sexuality. We can sort of get an approximate idea of what it is by talking about genitals and touching and arousal and stuff, but how do we define it?</p>

<p>There's only one solution:</p>

<h2>Don't.</h2>

<p>I'm going to take a step sideways here.</p>

<p>Some people say that <strong>consent</strong> is an important concept when talking about sex and sexuality. The doctrine of "No means no" is that if a person says "no" to a sexual activity, then it's bad to push them into doing that activity. The much-stronger doctrine of "yes means yes", which I prefer, says that if a person <em>doesn't actively agree</em> to the activity, then consent hasn't been established, and it's not okay to go through with it.</p>

<p>Look at the above paragraph. <em>There is no reason for the word "sexual" to appear in it.</em></p>

<p>Suppose you and a friend are hanging out and you want to play a board game. You suggest playing the game; your friend shrugs. You go and get the board game and set it up, then hand your friend the dice so that ze can take zir first turn. Ze hesitates. "Come on," you say, "I already set it up and everything." Then ze rolls the dice and makes a move.</p>

<p>You've just pushed your friend into an activity ze did not want. <strong>Compliance is not consent</strong>, so you're now nonconensually playing a board game, and that's a bad thing that you shouldn't have done.</p>

<p>I admit it's less bad than pushing someone into sex, but that's mainly just because sex usually involves stronger feelings than playing a board game. My point is that the principle is the same: One of them is worse than the other, but they're both bad in the same way. Humans are supposed to cooperate with each other to do things that help everyone. And because humans are often very different from each other, it's impossible to cooperate without clear communication. In the example above, instead of deciding what <em>you</em> wanted and then trying to get your friend to want it too, you should have asked zem what ze was interested in and tried to find something you'd both like.</p>

<h2>A personal story</h2>

<p>I enjoy tying myself up for sexual pleasure. I can (when I want to) get very sexually aroused by the idea of being helpless, of being immobile, of having other people beat me at games or contests, of being held or touched or hurt against my will. I'm also <em>extremely</em> hostile to anyone who tries to do any of these things to me, or even play at doing them to me, without my consent.<footnote(a(I'd be somewhat interested in doing it consensually with other people I trust, but coordinating with other people is too much of an inconvenience for me to try very hard at that. If you're reading this and you know me... you interested? :-))a)></p>

<p>Most of that has been true since I was in elementary school (ages 5-9, for non-US people). I didn't have a "sexually aroused" feeling until after puberty, but I enjoyed tying myself up, with as little clothes on as my family would allow, and I associated my thoughts about that with a feeling in my genitals (which, in my case, are a penis and testicles; I have a typical "male-sexed" body). I liked reading books that talked about medieval torture methods, because I was fascinated with that feeling. I didn't talk about it much, because other people, both at school and at home, had discouraged me from touching my genitals, talking about my genitals, or, basically, doing anything that <em>acknowledged the existence</em> of my genitals. In this way, adults prevented my child self from enjoying zir sexuality. Adults should not do this; it's a bad, harmful thing to do, and I won't forgive any of them for it any time soon, although it's hardly the worst thing that anyone did to me in my childhood.</p>

<p>(There's also a complicating factor: Throughout my life, my <em>non-sexual</em> daydreams and fantasies have also often been about traumatic experiences that I haven't personally had. I remeber reading a book about some real-life heroes who suffered severe injuries, not because I liked heroism, but because I liked injury. I don't know why I'm so fascinated with pain and suffering, but it's something that is pretty much innate and constant for me.)</p>

<p>I remember that I was always unwilling to play a lot of physical games, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game)">Tag</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_Flag">Capture the Flag</a>, with other children, and when people <em>did</em> force me to play the games, I cheated at them. I'm beginning to suspect that that's because I associated losing at games, especially games involving touch, with sexuality. I am <em>not okay</em> with anyone doing anything sexual with me unless I have complete trust in them as a friend, and there are less than a dozen people in the world whom I trust that much (although it's been going up now that I've been at college). Of course, it was <em>extremely not okay</em> for anyone to be forcing me into playing those games in the first place; I think some adults did it because they falsely believed that it would help me socialize with other children. (I didn't <em>want</em> to socialize with groups of other children, so that wasn't even "good intentions with a bad result" &ndash; it was hostile intentions in the first place, and if they didn't know, it was because they were too arrogant to ask me what I wanted.)</p>

<p>While I'm talking about myself, I might as well mention that I'm not sexually attracted to humans, regardless of their sex or gender, and I don't particularly like orgasms. I masturbate to orgasm sometimes, but that's really only <em>in order to</em> stop feeling aroused. There's a stereotype about men as being only interested in sticking their penises in things until they orgasm; I'm not sure if I count as a counterexample, since I have a male-sexed body but I'm not male-identifying, but anyway, I much prefer slow and deliberate touch, over all my body, rather than excessively genitals-focused, goal-focused stuff (and I think that stereotype connects to a lot of other male stereotypes. Ugh.).</p>

<p>All of those attributes of me are perfectly normal and nothing to see a psychologist about. And if, on the other hand, you <em>don't</em> have any of the attributes that I've just described, that's <em>also</em> perfectly normal and nothing to see a psychologist about.</p>

<h2>Back to the big picture</h2>

<p>By now, you probably get the main point I'm trying to make: Different people like different things, and that's exactly how it should be. Some of those things are sexual, but it doesn't really matter <em>too</em> much to figure out which ones are sexual and which aren't. Since people aren't all the same, they don't instantly know how other people feel, but it's possible to deal with that by communicating in a clear, honest, cooperative way. And you shouldn't listen to other people telling you what you should like; you should figure out what you like for yourself.</p>

<p>All of that should be <em>obvious</em>.</p>

<p>(Oh right, there's a cultural norm that says it's bad to just enjoy yourself for the sake of enjoying yourself &ndash; especially in a sexual way, but also in general, becuase it's more important to do what's culturally acceptable than to do what you like! And there's this whole notion that what two (or more, or just one) consenting people<footnote((Yes, PEOPLE. I only just noticed that people usually say "consenting adults" when they say this; I will now have to be horribly offended whenever I see someone write it in that way.))> do in private is anybody else's business. And there's the belief that&mdash; ...but all those beliefs are stupid and ridiculous and I have no idea why anyone believes them<footnote((Actually, I do have a lot of ideas about why people believe those things. It's just that they don't make any <em>sense</em>.))> and I should have stuck to my plan to not try to talk about them in this post! Clearly I should stop now before I accidentally dignify those notions with a <em>response</em>.)</p>

<p>So, there's a blog. A <em>feminist</em> blog. On the <em>Internet</em>. And it's really good. If you like feminism, you should probably read it. If you dislike feminism, you should <em>definitely</em> read it.</p>

<p>Its name is Fugitivus.</p>

<p>The writing at Fugitivus informs a lot of the way I think about interpersonal abuse. Which means it informs a lot of the way I think about how people interact with each other in general, because I think there's a lot of subtle abusive behaviors in almost every interaction between two or more people. (For that matter, there's a lot of subtle abusive behaviors in most people's interactions with themselves.) A year and a half ago, I read essentially the entire blog archive, and it has seriously changed how I think about other humans, especially in relation to gender (it is a <em>feminist</em> blog, after all). Harriet J, the author, has good ideas, and ze is a really, really good writer.<footnote((For me, at least. Different kinds of writing appeal to different people, and it would be foolish to say that there's a single standard for "good writing". That said, there are a lot of things I think Harriet J does well &ndash; ze gets to the point, has a clear flow from idea to idea... but instead of writing you an extensive footnote about these nuances, I invite you to just go and read zir blog.))></p>

<p>I recommend Fugitivus without reservation. However, since it contains a lot of discussion about rape and abuse, you might not want to read it at a time when you're going to need to feel good about the world in the near future.</p>

<p><del>Fugitivus is at (surprise!) www.fugitivus.net.</del> UPDATE: fugitivus.net is dead now. An older version of the blog, with most of the posts still visible, still exists at <a href="https://fugitivus.wordpress.com/">fugitivus.wordpress.com</a>.

<p>This afternoon, a reader asked me about how I use the term "neurodiversity". So I noticed that I hadn't made an epic post about what neurodiversity means to me.</p>

<p>I guess it's time to do that!</p>

<h2>What neurodiversity is</h2>

<p>As a concept, neurodiversity is the notion that different people's brains work differently.</p>

<p>As a movement or ideology, neurodiversity is the notion that brain differences are a natural part of how humanity works, and that our society ought to act in a way that works well for everyone, not just people who happen to have "normal"-enough brains.<footnote((A historical note: The term "neurodiversity" originates from the autistic self-advocacy movement, and is still sometimes used to refer only (or mostly) to autism. "Neurodiversity" is obviously the right term for the more-broadly-focused principle that I'm describing in this post, so if you don't think it means that already, I hereby steal it.))> It's about finding healthy ways to handle the problems that sometimes come from brain differences, while making good use of the advantages that come from having a neurodiverse population.</p>

<h2>What neurodiversity implies</h2>

<p>Neurodiversity means asking your friends how they feel, rather than assuming that you can always tell from their facial expressions or body language. It means trusting a person's account of zir own experiences, rather than assuming ze is dishonest or deluded when ze says something that seems unnatural to you.<footnote((Especially because people who lie about themselves usually figure out how to tell lies that sound natural to most people.))></p>

<p>Neurodiversity means arranging events that appeal to introverts as well as extroverts. It means recognizing that huge, noisy gatherings appeal to some people, and small, quiet ones appeal to others. It means not rating "happiness" by measuring extroverted behaviors. It means not assigning prescriptive standards of what people are "supposed" to want.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not expecting everyone to be able to participate in every activity. It means that when you're teaching a class, or running a conference, it's okay to propose a "fun" activity or an "icebreaker" game, but if someone says ze doesn't want to play, you must immediately accept that and not push zem into playing, even if you think zir objection is silly. It means being ready to compromise and seek alternate solutions when dividing tasks among people, because some things that are easy for you can be hard for others. It means not saying that a person is lazy if ze is too depressed to work, or that a person is selfish if ze needs others to cover for zem because a certain task has traumatic associations for zem. It means accepting all of those things <em>regardless of whether you know the specific conditions affecting zem</em>, because ze is not obligated to give you an extensive rationale for refusing any task &ndash; especially since, in some cases, ze may not be able to explain it in a way you would understand.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means understanding that some things that are entirely harmless to you can interfere with other people's ability to function. It means accepting that flickering lights, or background noise, or <em>lack</em> of background noise, or smells you might think are nice, or the presence of non-human animals, can all be too overwhelming for some people. It means being willing to find spaces that accomodate other people's needs, even if you can't see those needs.</em>

<p>Neurodiversity means giving trigger warnings before discussing traumatic subjects, so that people struggling with PTSD or self-harm or suicidal thoughts can avoid such material when they need to. It <em>also</em> means having enough respect for survivors to allow them to <em>choose</em> when to engage, rather than avoiding difficult subjects entirely.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not making too many assumptions based on how people are on the outside. It means not assuming a person is stupid because ze has language difficulties, or that ze is "immature" because ze gets upset easily when someone interferes with zir routine. It also means not assuming that a person <em>doesn't</em> have a mental disability just because you don't notice anything unusual about zem.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means recognizing that brain differences are often good. It means not calling a person's difference a "disability" unless ze identifies it as a disability zemself. It means not trying to "cure" someone if they don't ask for it. It means valuing the perspectives of autistic people <em>and</em> non-autistic people, extroverts <em>and</em> introverts, trans people <em>and</em> cis people, people with strong empathy <em>and</em> people with no empathy, sexuals <em>and</em> asexuals, multiples <em>and</em> singlets, people with spiritual instincts <em>and</em> those without.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not judging people for their feelings, even if those feelings are distasteful to you. It means not saying "pedophile" when you mean "child molester", because people don't choose who they're attracted to.<footnote((Also, as far as I've heard, most child molesters aren't pedophiles; they target children because children are easy targets, not because they have any particular attraction to them. And children are easy targets because the rest of society has already done most of the work of shaming them into not talking about how they were attacked, and making sure other adults won't believe them if they do talk about it.))> It means not stigmatizing people just for having no sense of empathy, because people don't choose whether they feel empathy. It means not writing people off as "attention-seeking", because when a person is looking for attention, there's usually a good reason for it.<footnote((People say this line a lot whenever a female teenager makes an ineffective suicide attempt. Usually, a person doesn't <em>do</em> that when ze doesn't have major problems in zir life, and if you ignore zem or ridicule zem because ze's "just looking for attention", then you're probably contributing to the problems that ze was trying to handle in the first place.))></p>

<p>Neurodiversity means understanding that some people may enjoy things that you find disgusting, and some people may be disgusted by things you enjoy; it means that both of those are okay as long as you don't try to push your opinions onto each other. It means not trying to insist that some consensual sexual behaviors are "normal" and others are "perverted". It means not ridiculing people from different cultural backgrounds, even if they observe traditions that seem weird to you.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not thinking that a story can have a "universal" message, because there is no universal human experience. A love story will not include your reader if ze is aromantic. A story about the folly of arrogance will not include your reader if ze habitually underrates zir own abilities. A story about a person who doesn't always see eye-to-eye with zir parents, but eventually comes to accept them, will not include your reader if ze has had to completely cut ties with zir own abusive parents. A story about a person who fights back against abusers will not include your reader if ze is a strong empath who can't hurt another human. Neurodiversity means believing that all those readers exist, and that they all matter. If you're a writer, it means finding ways to write about the experiences of people who are often ignored in mainstream literature.</p>

<p>And most of all, <strong>neurodiversity means talking about how we perceive the world</strong>. I was once having a conversation about neurodiversity on another website, and it turned out that some of the people in the conversation had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow">visual snow</a> and others didn't. <em>And the people who had it hadn't known that most people didn't have it</em>, because people usually don't talk about even basic things like how stuff looks when you look at it. Or when they do, they get into ridiculous arguments about how things "really" look, instead of honestly comparing their perceptions. And when I read things like <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520/">this article about people with brain damage that eventually made them commit violent crimes</a>, I can't help but think that if we lived in a culture where people would talk about what they feel, and where there would be support systems for people who need psychological help, then a lot of horrors could be avoided. Talking about things is the only way we can even <em>begin</em> to solve the problems they cause; most of the problems in the world are caused, directly or indirectly, by human brains, so <em>we should definitely be talking about what those brains are doing.</em></p>

<p>Does that sound like a good idea to you? Because it definitely sounds like a good idea to me.</p>

<li>Empathy: Sadly, I don't know of any non-empath self-advocacy sites that are healthy enough for me to be willing to publicly recommend them. For that matter, I'm the only person I know of who describes zemself as a "non-empath". Empathy differences are probably the least-explored issue out of any of these, and a lot of people are still happy to say that "not having emotional empathy" is the same as "being completely evil", which is kinda... not true, and also a pretty horrible thing to say.</li>

<p>I had an idea that doesn't fit into any of the current stories I'm developing, and basically wants to be a novel in its own right, so I'm probably not going to be able to write it. So I'll write about it here instead. For fun, I'm going to describe it in the order I thought of it.</p>

<p>It started with the idea of <strong>destroying a person's mind</strong>. Zir body still functions, and ze can even still talk a little and give basic replies, but most of zir personality is gone, ze doesn't recognize people ze used to know, ze's completely cold and unfeeling, and ze barely bothers to fulfill zir basic needs. This kind of thing <em>can</em> happen in real life, but it's more common in fantasy settings, especially horror-fantasy; I was thinking about it because something similar happens in <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/main/posts/38-recommended-website-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality">HP:MoR</a>.</p>

<p>I've got a lot of respect for good horror stories. After all, what is writing if not an attempt to effectively convey an image or idea, and what is horror if not a very specific, very powerful image or idea? The destroying-someone's-mind thing fits right in; it's been done a lot of times, because it's effective. After all, the standard advice for horror fantasy is that the closer something is to reality, the more horrifying it is. Or, another way to look at it is that humans usually have a very strong fear of losing people they know, and they tend to be somewhat numb to actual death because there's lots of death in stories, so when you find a way to destroy a person that isn't actual killing, you get the full horror with much less resistance.</p>

<p>Back to the story. At this point, it was only a germ of an idea, and not a particularly strong one, because technically, doing that to a person is pretty much the same as killing them, and "somebody dies" isn't really the basis for a story. But I was fascinated by the idea. It's got an obvious question in it: What to do with the non-functional person? To me, the answer is easy: It's not a person anymore, just a shell. If it causes you inconvenience, go ahead and kill it.</p>

<p>But <strong>whenever something is easy, I try to make it hard</strong>. So I thought, what if a little bit of the original person is left? So little that you'd barely think they're the same person, so little that it'd practically be revolting to make the comparison, but just enough that if you knew who ze was, there can be moments where you almost think ze's back again. And then the moment passes and ze's the shell again. I can get a big variety of <strong>different reactions</strong> from the people who knew zem before the change: There can be one who wants to kill the shell because ze's an insult to the memory of the original person, there can be one who thinks ze can be brought back somehow (hah!<footnote((Of course, that kind of thing (people getting messed up in one way or another and then being fully cured) happens ALL THE TIME in conventional stories. I hate it! Not just because it's unrealistic (in real life, brain damage is brain damage and there's usually no way to recover the bits that are lost), but mainly because it kills the impact of the thing. After all, if it can be completely undone, it can't ultimately be a very significant event, and if it was supposed to sound significant, I feel kinda cheated.))>), there can be one who tries to be nice to the shell anyway, but gets nothing in return because the shell has no sense of gratitude or empathy anymore (and because even if ze did, ze'd be able to tell that the kindness was sort of condescending). Ze sometimes acts weak and vulnerable and oblivious and naive, sometimes cynical and jaded and violent, and nobody can tell what the pattern is (I'd know how ze worked, but the other characters wouldn't). This kind of thing is great fodder for a story, because it's got <em>lots</em> of natural conflict built into it.</p>

<p>But there's still something in the corner of my mind, something I feel like known the whole time but can't put my finger on, that makes the idea yucky and incomplete.</p>

<p>And then it hits me.</p>

<p>Like any good fantasy story, what we're really talking about here is <strong>real life</strong>. Sure, in real life, there isn't a villain with magical powers who destroys your mind, but what we're really talking about is a person who develops major psychological problems over the course of zir life, for reasons we don't understand. And the story I've just described is a strong story in technical terms, but it's also a pretty condescending story. It's the "Look at these poor people who have to LIVE with a DISABLED person, see what THEY have to DEAL WITH" story. The story that leaves out what the disabled person zemself has to live with (one, a disability, and two, non-disabled people who aren't nice). What my germ-of-an-idea is missing is <em>the perspective of the shell</em>.</p>

<p>And yeah, the shell's perspective is really messed up. Half the time, ze can barely even tell what's going on around zem. Sometimes ze's aware that something's wrong; when somebody insults zem, ze feels like ze's supposed to be angry about it, and wonders why ze doesn't feel anything. It's like being half-asleep in a dream, and only being vaguely aware that things aren't the way they would be if you were awake. Other times, ze feels like ze knows what ze has to do, and has a strong impluse to hurt another person, and does it without wondering why or even feeling angry. And then there are those eerie moments of lucidity where ze knows exactly what's going on, and can talk about it, but doesn't know how long ze can stay that way.</p>

<p>But there's just enough of zem there to still be a person. Ze knows how ze feels about things, even though ze usually can't express it (especially because, before the change, ze didn't <em>have</em> the same feelings and didn't need to figure out how to express them). Ze can carry on a conversation, although ze tends to lose interest quickly, because most people try to talk to zem about things ze doesn't care about anymore. Ze can feed zemself, and dress zemself, most of the time.</p>

<p>The story goes like this:</p>

<p>The main characters are two siblings of the same gender, if any (I'm imagining them female, but it could be anything). The first is calm and calculating; the second is emotional and aggressive. The first likes comfort, the second likes fun and excitement. The first has a strong sense of tactics, the second has a strong sense of justice. If I don't mind the clich&eacute;, they're identical twins. They complement each other perfectly, and they have a really strong, loving bond.</p>

<p>Then something happens (industrial accident? battle with an evil wizard?), and Twin 2 isn't the same anymore. The first thing Twin 1 notices is that Twin 2's facial expression is wrong. Twin 2 is usually either grinning or furious, or both, but now, ze's expressionless and quiet. Twin 1 asks what's wrong, and Twin 2 ignores zem. Twin 1 pesters Twin 2 for answers until ze turns and says, "Shut up. I don't like you.". And means it.</p>

<p>The rest of the story has two main conflicts.</p>

<p>The first, the more obvious one, is Twin 1's internal conflict. Twin 1 has to deal with the loss of zir sibling &ndash; probably the most important entity in the world, to zem &ndash; and worse yet, the presence of this... <em>thing</em> in zir sibling's body. But there's just enough of zir sibling left for zem to cling to the hope that it'll come back. So ze keeps going back to Twin 2, trying to talk to zem, trying to get zem back somehow. Twin 1 keeps telling zemself that Twin 2 is gone, and trying to convince zemself not to keep trying at it.</p>

<p><strong>But the real story is Twin 2's story.</strong> The story of someone whose brain doesn't work the way everyone else thinks it's supposed to. The story of someone who has to figure out what to make of zir life, when ze doesn't feel like ze fits into any of the stories everyone else is telling about zem. When Twin 1 tries to tell zem what zir life was like before, ze only feels alienated.<footnote((Twin 1 is taking a personal sense of loss, which is a valid feeling, and turning it into a coercive way of interacting with another human being. I really, <em>really</em> don't like the way Twin 1 behaves in this story, although I can understand where it comes from.))> Twin 2's memory is still there just enough that ze knows ze's supposed to be sticking with Twin 1, but the feeling of connection is basically gone, and the only reason they stay together is because neither knows where to go from there. Twin 1 clings to Twin 2 like ze's desperately holding on to the side of a sinking ship, while Twin 2 stays with Twin 1 like ze's hanging around a crime scene out of morbid fascination. Each of them needs to realize that it's not healthy, and cut off contact with the other.</p>

<p>And it's all made much, <em>much</em> more complicated by the fact that there's just enough of Twin 2's original personality remaining that you can't say ze's just a whole different person.</p>

<p>In a bunch of cool things like feminism, there's the concept of "agency". An <em>agent</em> is a person who does something, so <em>agency</em> is when a person, or character, plays an active role in deciding what happens in zir life, rather than being a hapless victim. One part of disability-conscious writing is to make sure your disabled characters have agency &ndash; make sure they're not just victims to be pitied or monsters to be avoided.</p>

<p>And so Twin 2 is ultimately the one who moves on first. Ze finally manages to find a group of people who accept zem for what ze is, and moves away from Twin 1 for good.</p>

<p>Blargh.</p>

<p>I'm ready to post the novella that I mentioned in my first post here. I did some last editing earlier today. But before I can post it, I have to make some changes to the website, because I don't want to just copy the text into a blog post. And I can't make those changes right away because I'm tired of doing computer programming (colloquially, "coding").</p>

<p>I don't know why it happened. It's not because I'd been doing a lot of it, because I can sometimes code for weeks on end without getting tired. And it's not because I was failing to make progress, because I <em>had</em> been making progress on my drawing program when the tiredness hit me a week and a half ago. I suppose I could make an analogy to the poet's so-called "muse" &ndash; a force of inspiration that seems to come and go at its own whim, without the poet/writer/coder/whatever being able to control it. On the other hand, I don't actually believe that there are things in this world that we can't understand.</p>

<p>Annoyingly enough, essentially <em>all</em> of my current projects require me to do some coding before they can proceed. So this is a bit of a lull in my activity. Which makes me think of the concept of "idea producers" vs. "idea consumers"<footnote((I got those terms from somewhere; I don't remember where. It might have been from Edward de Bono's writing.))> &ndash; for example, people who write popular songs vs. people who listen to them. Obviously, each individual person sometimes produces ideas and sometimes consumes ideas, but some produce more than others, and some consume more than others.</p>

<p>Anyway, I described that concept so that I could say this: I've been taking a break from idea production, and consumed some ideas instead, by spending a week playing the computer role-playing game "Planescape: Torment".</p>

<p>The way I see it, Planescape: Torment is more like a novel than like a video game. Computer role-playing games (CRPGs) usually have fairly simple plots, like "You're a bunch of heroes; go save the world from the Dark Lord!". They have a bunch of dialogue, so you need to be <em>able</em> to read, but the main point is to do battle with foul monsters. Planescape: Torment is the opposite: You need to be <em>able</em> to fight monsters, but the main point is to explore the intriguing dialogue and plot of the game. I'm not going to talk about it too much, because (1) it has enough social problems that it isn't up to my standards for "recommended websites", and (2) even if it didn't, it's not readily available (since it's a commercial, non-Free, Windows-only game). But it <em>did</em> make me think about a bunch of ideas, which is cool.</p>

<p>I suppose I could write something here about why I, as a writer, find it valuable to read other people's work, or about why exchanging stories is a good thing even when they sometimes teach problematic lessons, or about the value of cariacture and other "unrealistic" elements in writing, but I'm not sure my ideas about those things are organized enough right now. Oh well.</p>

<p>Before we can really talk about pornography, we have to know what it is. Of course, defining "pornography" is notoriously difficult; there's even a quote from a former United States Supreme Court Justice saying "perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so".<footnote((See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">this Wikipedia article about that statement</a>.))> I usually don't like going to dictionaries for answers, because dictionaries are usually a few steps behind the natural evolution of the language, but here, I'll go ahead and ask a dictionary. At the time of this writing, Wiktionary defines "pornography" as:</p>

<blockquote>The explicit depiction of sexual subject matter, especially with the sole intention of sexually exciting the viewer.</blockquote>

<p>That wasn't so hard.<footnote((I guess it's not hard to define it as long as you're not trying to decide when ambiguously-written Puritanical censorship laws are allowed under the rules of an equally ambiguous document, namely the United States Constitution.))> So, we're basically talking about stories, pictures, videos, and so on, of people having sex or being in sexual situations, <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/main/posts/47-sex">whatever that means</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, sounds great, right? I mean, most people enjoy a certain amount of sexual excitement. And, compared with other ways of getting sexually excited, pornography is incredibly low-risk and easy to distribute. Some ways, like printing lots of pornographic magazines, consume some of the Earth's resources, which is kinda bad, but we now have digital media and the Internet. And I don't think anyone has ever been physically abused by their porn, or gotten pregnant from it, or anything like that.</p>

<p>And it gets better: Exchanging honest depictions of <em>anything</em> helps people, because knowledge is good, and the exchange of ideas helps people understand things better and learn about other people's perspectives. As I've mentioned before, this is especially important right now for sexual stuff, because our society has nowhere <em>near</em> enough honest conversations about sex and sexuality. Sure, there's lots of sex and sexuality in our society, but it's mostly yucky. Like, even <em>more</em> yucky than most of the other stuff in our society. That's pretty damn yucky. So we could definitely use more good pornography.</p>

<h2>But wait!</h2>

<p>Since I already quoted one famous person in this post, I might as well quote another.</p>

<blockquote>...pornography is the orchestrated destruction of women's bodies and souls; rape, battery, incest, and prostitution animate it; dehumanization and sadism characterize it; it is war on women, serial assaults on dignity, identity, and human worth; it is tyranny. Each woman who has survived knows from the experience of her own life that pornography is captivity--the woman trapped in the picture used on the woman trapped wherever he's got her.</blockquote>

<p>That's Andrea Dworkin.<footnote((This is from Dworkin's book "Pornography: Men Possessing Women". <a href="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/PornIntro2.html">The relevant section is hosted here</a> (TRIGGER WARNING for details of rape and physical violence).))> I'm quoting Dworkin because ze's essentially the <em>icon</em> of anti-porn feminism. I disagree with some of the things ze says,<footnote((Like saying that "sadism" is a bad thing. It's totally okay if you practice it with consent from all participants.))> and there are definitely some problems with zir writing, but ze did have a lot of insight and a <em>lot</em> of influence on the feminist movement.</p>

<p>So, um. How did we get from "Pornography is pretty cool" to "Pornography is totally evil"?</p>

<p>Let's take a step back and I'll tell you something. I've been watching some porn videos recently. Free, online porn videos, to be specific. I won't give links, because I have a policy of not linking to things that are openly racist, sexist, and so on,<footnote((Remind me to write that post about why we can sometimes get positive effects from stories even when the stories have big problems in them.))> but they're not hard to find.</p>

<p><q>But Eli</q>, you say, "How can you enjoy porn if you don't feel sexual attraction to people?". It's a valid question. And, first, it's <em>true</em> &ndash; I don't enjoy most porn. But there's some porn that I do enjoy, because although I don't feel sexual attraction, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">mirror neurons</a> are fully functional. When I'm watching a porn video, I can feel as if I'm one of the people in the video, and imagine how it feels to be doing what they're doing; I can identify with them.</p>

<p>But, in mainstream porn, with very, <em>very</em> few exceptions, I can only identify with the female people.<footnote((Since mainstream porn has very rigid gender roles, this implies both female-sexed and female-gendered.))> I'd kind of <em>like</em> to be able to identify with the male ones, because they have bodies that are more like mine, but when male people do appear in the porn I've been watching, they just don't act like they're enjoying themselves. When they're on top, or standing, they hold themselves in a really stiff way, and don't relax. When they <em>do</em> relax, when they're supposedly receiving pleasure, they just go limp. They don't squirm around like I would or like the female people do. In short, their <em>bodies</em> are more like mine, but their <em>behavior</em> is so much <em>less</em> like mine that I can't relate to them at all.</p>

<p>And that's part of what Andrea Dworkin is getting at. Mainstream porn has a certain amount of variety, but it only shows a very limited range of what male sexuality is supposed to be like. It says: If you've got a penis, you're not supposed to enjoy yourself; you're supposed to be dominant over other people. And... seriously! There is no good reason for that! It's a bad thing to do <em>and</em> it isn't what people want! Seriously, science people have studied it, and it turns out that when you ask them in private, most male people will tell you they actively dislike the whole "masculinity equals dominance (and hypersexuality)" crap! It's like people who say that movies with female protagonists won't sell, even though there is already abundant evidence against that assertion! It seems like the entire industry is conspiring <em>just to annoy me</em>, because there really isn't a better explanation than that!<footnote((I think it's actually just because the people in the porn industry aren't very creative.))></p>

<p>And, besides that, there are about a million other huge problems with mainstream porn, like the way it sets prescriptive standards for attractiveness,<footnote((Like "be female-sexed, shave every part of your body except your scalp, have long hair, and be white" &ndash; and when a non-white person DOES appear in mainstream porn, they're <em>fetishized</em>, which just goes to show that no matter what you do, you can always find a way to do it horribly wrong.))> and the way it's often a model for unrealistic and unhealthy beavior. And <em>that</em>'s how we got from "porn is pretty cool" to "porn is really bad": by looking at how it's actually practiced, rather than just considering it as an abstract concept...</p>

<p>...and <em>those</em> are the points on which I agree with Andrea Dworkin and anti-porn feminism. There's a big problem with pornography. So what's the solution? Their ideal solution is to eliminate porn entirely. Now, I'm going to ignore the fact that that's impossible, becase as you probably know, I'm a big fan of pursuing goals that seem impossible. What I <em>am</em> going to say is that, if this impossible goal was achieved, it would be horrible! Current porn has problems, but in essence, pornography is a good thing, a healthy thing, a positive thing. If I made a porn video that kicked people in the face, then I would be guilty of kicking people in the face, but it wouldn't be because I made a porn video; it would be because, for some bizarre reason, I decided to have it kick people in the face. And in <em>exactly the same way</em>, if I make porn that's degrading to a particular group of people, or that promotes unhealthy relationship dynamics, then I'm guilty of degrading people and decreasing relationships' health, and that has very little to do with the fact that what I made was pornographic.</p>

<p>The solution to the problems with porn is <em>to make better porn</em>.</p>

<p>Hmm, maybe I should do that sometime.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/main/posts/52-neurodiversity">when I said we should talk about how we experience the world</a>? This post is me doing that.</p>

<p>I can't imagine pain. At all. Or, to be more specific, there's <em>something</em> I can do that I call "imagining" &ndash; which might, or might not, be exactly the same thing as what other people call "imagining" &ndash; that works very well for sight, and sound, and physical touch, and a few other things, but doesn't work at all for physical pain. With other sensations, I can conjure up the feeling and have a sense that's almost as strong as actually feeling it, but with pain it just doesn't work &ndash; I can try to conjure up the feeling of pain, but nothing happens.</p>

<p>The same is true in my dreams and my memories. Even if I've actually experienced pain recently, like if I stubbed my toe, I can't <em>remember</em> the actual feeling of pain afterwards any more than I could normally imagine it.<footnote((As far as I know, when the brain remembers a sensory experience, it uses pretty much the same process that it does to imagine one, so this shouldn't be too surprising.))> My dreams usually have visual images in them, and occasionally have sounds or touch-sensations; they try to be semi-realistic, so, for instance, if someone hits a gong in my dream, the dream provides the sensation of hearing a gong sound. But if someone drops something on my foot, then the dream <em>tries</em> to provide a pain sensation, but <em>fails</em>.</p>

<p>Since I've never been anyone but myself, I don't automatically know whether anyone else shares this attribute. So, after I was thinking about this yesterday, I decided to ask my biological parents.<footnote((Who are also my legal and social parents. I say "biological parents" because the genetic relation is the most important thing here.))> And that was interesting, because <em>one</em> of them said ze could imagine pain as easily as anything else, and the <em>other</em> said ze couldn't.</p>

<p>So, dear readers, I'm curious: Does <em>your</em> imagination work this way? Please leave a comment if you feel comfortable doing so!</p>

<h2>1.</h2>

<p>I once had a conversation with two friends. At some point, the following exchange happened (heavily paraphrased, since this was more than a year ago and I didn't write it down):</p>

<blockquote><p>Me: This is kind of an oversimplification, but: Privileged people make statements about the world, and oppressed people make statements about themselves.</p>
<p>Friend 1: I hadn't thought about it that way. I can see how that relates to my experiences.</p></blockquote>

<p>At which point Friend 2 pointed out how I'd made a statement about the world, while Friend 1 had made a statement about zemself! (Which fits the description, since I'm pretty sure I'm much more privileged than Friend 1.) The theory goes that privileged people don't tend to recognize their privilege, so they assume that the world works the same way for everybody, while people who lack those privileges are acutely aware of the fact that some other people have things that they don't have.</p>

<p>Now, here's an interesting thing: Talking about the world, and not talking about oneself, is a bit of a red flag for me when it applies to other people. I'm automatically slightly wary of people who don't talk about their own experiences &ndash; it's not a particularly strong feeling, just one of the many things that factors into my perception of a person. But <em>I'm</em> also like that, often.<footnote((Or at least, I used to be. Since I've started noticing it, I've also started making sure I don't do it as much as I used to &ndash; not for a social reason, though, but for an intellectual reason. I'm compulsively honest, so I don't like saying things that I don't know to be true, and it's much more honest to state things in terms of how I know them than it is to state them as objective truths. And that goes double for what I write on this blog.))> I can have long, abstract conversations that aren't grounded in my own experiences at all, because I'm so sure that I know objective truths.</p>

<p>So, would I be wary of myself? I can't know that for sure, but I think I wouldn't be, because... Well, to tell you that, I'll tell you this first:</p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p>On January 4, 2011, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>If I say "I feel [feeling] about [event]", it's probably false. Call me out on it. I want to stop pretending so much.</blockquote>

<p>Sometime during high school &ndash; ages 15-16, I think &ndash; I became much better at communicating and socializing with a large subset of the people of my own age. I don't know exactly why that happened; it was probably a combination of several things. One of them is that I was changing neurologically as I aged; one of them is that the people my age had started to become mature and intelligent enough that I was actually interested in talking to them.</p>

<p>One of the trite-but-generally-true things that people say about non-empaths is that we're very good at faking emotions. Or, I'm not sure if <em>faking</em> is quite the right word. For me, once I started actually trying to engage with people in a peer-social way, it was natural to view communication as a process of trying out different ways of expressing ideas, seeing how people responded, and adjusting my way of expressing myself to achieve the most favorable outcome. So natural that I do it all without thinking, and it doesn't feel like fakery at all.</p>

<p>Take a step back again...</p>

<p>In the years before those, the special-education-school-people seemed to think that I should improve my "social skills". I quite firmly believed that there is no objective standard of good communication, that pushing a particular standard on someone is an injustice, and that if I adapted to the system they were advocating, then I would in fact become <em>worse</em> at some types of communication as I became "better" at the kind of peer-social activities which they thought were important and which I wasn't interested in.</p>

<p>Naturally, I still believe all of those things. I could ramble on for quite some time about those things, and probably will in a future post. But there's one particular attribute of myself that is relevant to both that and to this post as a whole:</p>

<p>I am compulsively honest. I cannot lie or intentionally mislead another person.<footnote((Well, except that I'm a good actor. I think that if you gave me time to prepare, and a really good reason (like lying to someone who's plotting murder about where their intended victim is), I could lie without hesitation. But that's not a very common situation.))> If someone asks me a question, I am compelled to either answer it as accurately as I can, or explicitly refuse to answer it.</p>

<p>The "social skills" people don't like that. They think that you're supposed to tell "white lies"; you're supposed to try to play the social game, and not make things disruptive or awkward, even if that means saying things that are false and misleading. Now, let's pretend for a moment that I can <em>choose</em> whether or not to be honest, and ask whether I <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>The "social skills" people aren't entirely wrong. There <em>are</em> a lot of people who express a preference<footnote((I say "who express a preference" instead of "who prefer" because, when habitual lying is involved, I can't be sure exactly what other people think. I'm not trying to question their truthfulness, but as I mentioned, I am compelled not to overstate my knowledge.))> for the social system that has lots of lies in it. But there are also a lot of people who express a preference for honesty. So if I go around telling lies, I'm not "having good social skills" &ndash; I'm declaring an <em>allegiance</em> to one category of social skills over another. Every time I tell someone they look good when I think they don't, every time I say I liked someone's art when I was bored by it, I'm waving a flag and saying "Hey liars, look, I'm a liar just like you! Call me. We can hang out and tell some lies together." And if I tell the truth, I'm saying "Hey truth-tellers..."</p>

<p>Those might not be the most charitable descriptions. I think I'll call the categories "Placators" and "Truth-seekers" instead.</p>

<p>I'll conclude the tangent about my schooling by saying, the "social skills" people were placators in positions of petty authority who thought that everyone else should be a placator too, and anyone who wasn't a placator was deviant. Fuck 'em. It also bears mentioning that most people aren't pure placators or pure truth-seekers, if the descriptions even fit at all.</p>

<p>If I was a placator, and was primarily motivated by making the social game run smoothly, then I wouldn't have the slightest problem with adjusting my communication style to mimic the style of neurotypical people. But I'm not! So, to go back to the example, when I noticed myself saying things like "I hate it when...", I had a problem with that. Because, when I said that, I wasn't saying that I had actually experienced hatred. It was just a social gesture. It was me saying something false and misleading in order to make a conversation run smoothly, because I don't actually have feelings like that. I sometimes feel hatred, and I sometimes observe that things are very bad and should change, but I don't feel hatred <em>towards</em> the things. There's no emotional connection between stuff in my head and physical reality, just causal relationships.</p>

<h2>3.</h2>

<p>But a lot of people say those things honestly. And to go back to the beginning...</p>

<p>Most people have a lot of feelings that I don't have. They love people, they enjoy pure social interaction, and so forth; they <em>care strongly about things from their physical lives</em>. And what I realized &ndash; the realization that inspired me to write this post &ndash; was that when I'm wary of people who talk too much about abstract ideas, it's not because of that fact. It's because I've gotten the sense that they're not being honest. Because if you're talking about things that you're mildly interested in, but not talking about things that you really care about, that seems dishonest to me. I don't think there's necessarily anything <em>wrong</em> with it &ndash; e.g. if that's your way of staying away from subjects that you don't want to talk about but are socially unacceptable to dodge, more power to you &ndash; but I get along much better with people who are closer to the kind of radical honesty that I am compelled to practice myself.</p>

<p>And that's why I think I wouldn't be wary of myself: I'd be able to tell that the abstract ideas <em>are</em> the primary thing I care about. That instead of being a mask that hides my feelings, it's a true reflection of them.</p>

<p>I still haven't been doing much for a while - mostly playing online games, watching videos, and so forth. Oh, and running a quirky Mafia variant on an internet forum - you can <a href="http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=73126">check it out over here on the XKCD forums</a> if you're into that sort of thing. My inactivity has a lot to do with the fact that it's late in the summer, it's hot all the time, and I haven't been talking to other people too much. (Getting at least a little interaction with other people helps me, because it stimulates my mind and gives me new ideas.) I'm going to be going back to college relatively soon, too, and that's discouraging me from getting into projects a bit, even though I still have about three weeks left.</p>

<p>That said, I've still got a couple of projects running. I'm working on them occasionally, it's just that they're not taking the majority of my time.</p>

<p>One of them is that I'm learning more Javascript, so that I can make cool online games and utilities. <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/pac-asteroids-first.html">Check out this extremely-unfinished game for an example of what I'm messing with</a>. (EDIT: That's a link to the version that I wrote at the time of this post. <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/pac-asteroids.html">This is a link to the current version</a>, which I will keep messing with.)</p>

<p>The other is this: Since I'm blocked on the graphics editing software project, I've started just drawing stuff in an existing graphics program (namely GIMP). Here's something I randomly sketched a few days ago:</p>

<img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/6128/randomattempt20110813si.png" alt="Image [see below]" />
<p>(That's an image hosted on an external site. Tell me if it breaks. A transcript is in a footnote.<footnote((<p>Transcript of the above image:</p><p>Text: What shall I draw? thought I.<p>Picture: A cartoon of myself, with an excessively cheerful expression, thinking: Maybe something DARK & DISTURBING?</p><p>Picture: A gaunt face drawn in white on a black background, surrounded by orange streaks. Its thoughts are written messily: "I DON'T KNOW WHY I'VE BECOME LIKE THIS. I AM SO COLD, COLD!! <em>I DON'T NEED ANY HELP!!</em>"</p><p>Text: What sex is our friend the pyromaniac? I find it easier to read zem as male, but is the face actually characteristically male or is it just that I'm more familiar with that exaggerated gauntness on male characters, while our society makes people draw female people in pristine condition always?</p>))>)</p>

<p>I've also started sketching characters for a fairly absurd short comic (3-4 pages, probably). I might end up drawing that in the next week or two.</p>

<p>Speaking of posting comics here on this website, that's <em>yet another thing</em> that I'm going to need to do programming work for. It's not a problem if I just stick them in blog posts for the moment, but it'd be nice to have a more formal way of presenting them. I'm still planning to post that novella, too &ndash; I've edited it as much as I need to, and now the only thing stopping me from posting it is that I haven't been feeling like doing the technical end of things (and, again, I want it to be presented more nicely than just sticking it in a blog post).</p>

<p>Anyway, there's an update for you. Things will probably get more interesting when I head back to college &ndash; I'll try not to get so busy that I don't have time to blog, heh heh.</p>

<img src="/main/files/riotnrrd.png"  alt="Image: A panel of a comic. Some interesting people stand around; one says, 'So, do you like, gender and stuff?'" />

<p>That's a panel from <i>Riot Nrrd</i>, a wonderful webcomic.</p>

<p>I think <i>Riot Nrrd</i> was actually one of the inspirations for me to make this website when I did. If you read it, you'll certainly notice some similarities between its style of talking about social issues and mine. (Heck, the first strip opens with one of the characters ranting about portrayals of minority characters in popular media!) I'd say it's a great example of how a highly accessible<footnote((Not perfectly, of course. You can't read a webcomic if you're blind, for instance. But most humans find it easy to take information from visual images, and a prudent webcomic author will provide a text transcript for those who are vision-impaired.))> (and enjoyable) format like a serial webcomic can be used to promote good ideas about gender and stuff.</p>

<p>(You might also guess that its drawing style was one of the inspirations for the style I used in <i>People Are Wrong Sometimes</i>, but then you'd be wrong, since I hadn't found <i>Riot Nrrd</i> when I wrote that. But I would totally have been inspired by it if I had!)</p>

<p>(This post will assume basic knowledge of the United States college/university system.)</p>

<p>I've just returned to college, unpacked my stuff, and organized my new dorm room.</p>

<p>This semester isn't going to by my favorite. For some reason, pretty much none of the theater/art/writing classes I want to take are being taught this semester. So I'm mostly doing math classes instead. Now, for me, math is great; it's easy, useful, and enjoyable. It's just not what I'm truly passionate about.</p>

<p>Also, I'm stuck taking my college's English Composition class that's required for all students. (Normally you're supposed to take that in your first year (I'm in my third year now), but due to a series of inconvenient coincidences, I haven't been able to complete it yet.) I love composing English prose, but writing academic essays is completely uninteresting to me. Oh well; I just hope I end up with a professor who can make the material interesting.</p>

<p>On the plus side, since I'm a math whiz, taking mostly math courses means that I'll have quite a bit of free time during this semester, which I will be able to use to do stuff like drawing graphic stories! And college is an interesting place from the outset. I get lots more contact with people, and lots of opportunities to attend talks by interesting people who are doing cool things around the world.</p>

<p>In short, my idle time of this summer is now over! I'm going to be engaged in a lot of things, and I hope to blog about them frequently.</p>

<p>So, I was thinking about prose and graphic storytelling. Instead of me writing about a bunch of principles and abstractions and stuff, how about we go straight to an example? Here's a line of prose:</p>

<p><q>I knocked. No answer. Let myself in anyway. Where was he?</q></p>

<p>I generally think that graphic storytelling can express ideas much more quickly, so I deliberately constructed that line to be the opposite: Something that prose can express more quickly. Let's look at how we might write that in pure images:</p>

<img src="/main/files/knocking.png" alt="Image: Three panels. The first panel shows a person knocking at a door. The second shows zem waiting impatiently, thinking about the time. The third shows zem entering through the door, looking around. At the bottom left is a note that says 'Eli Dupree - 25 min sketch'"/>

<p>Those three panels might take up about a third of a page, if we're going to publish this as a print book. The line of prose, on the other hand, takes about, what, a twentieth of a page? Sure, a reader will be able to take in the images faster than they would read <em>a third of a page of text</em>, but still, the single prose line here much more compact and concise.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the prose glosses over a lot of details that we get to see in the images. The graphic narration tells us about the style of our main character's coat, zir attitude about being forced to wait, and a lot of other things. If I got the subtle body language right in the second panel, it tells us that it's chilly outside. So the graphic narration really tells us a lot more information, even if it takes up a little more space.</p>

<p>(The graphic narration also <em>doesn't</em> tell us the gender of the person the main character is seeking. To me, this is an <em>advantage</em> of graphic narration.)</p>

<p>We can also combine the two forms, like this:</p>

<img src="/main/files/knocking-combined.png" alt="Image: The third panel of the first image, but with the prose line written in narration boxes: 'I knocked. No answer. Let myself in anyway' at the top, and 'Where was he?' at the bottom."/>

<p>That conveys all the information from the prose line (obviously), and also most of the information from the three-panel image above, and it does it in only one panel. It also has an interesting attribute: It <em>repeats</em> information. You don't need the text to tell you that the person is going through a door. With the text there, you don't need the <em>image</em> to tell you that the person is going through a door. Either one does the job just as well.</p>

<p>In prose fiction writing (and playwriting and screenwriting), one of the standard principles is that redundancy is bad. You shouldn't explain something more than once, because after the first time, the reader is going to know what it says and be bored by it. And it's even worse in theatre and film, where the reader can't skim over dialogue ze doesn't need to hear.</p>

<p><em>But that isn't necessarily true in graphic narration.</em> Saying the same thing twice is bad in prose, because in prose, everything you say is part of the narrative flow. The reader can't read two lines at once, so everything you write is going to take up some amount of the reader's time, so you have to make every detail count.</p>

<p>Not so in graphic narration, where the reader <em>can</em> perceive an entire image at once. I mean, think about the most trivial example: I drew the coat in every panel. After the first panel, you know the person is wearing a coat, so if I was trying to eliminate all redundancy, I would <em>not draw the coat</em> in the later panels. But that's silly. The repetition of the coat is <em>good</em> redundancy, because it doesn't take the reader any extra time to see the coat in the later panels &ndash; in fact, it's actually <em>quicker</em> to glance over the same coat than to see something different. So basically, the rule is that if something takes up space in the narrative flow, you try to eliminate redundancy, but when you can sneak in extra information without disrupting the narrative flow, you should repeat yourself as much as possible! (Well, not if it prevents you from doing <em>other</em> cool stuff. But you probably get the idea.)</p>

<p>So, in short, graphic storytelling is a much more <em>condensed</em> format &ndash; you can convey a lot more information without taking any more of the reader's time. So why doesn't everybody do it?</p>

<p>OH YEAH, BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY KIND OF HARD.</p>

<p>See the little note at the bottom of the three-panel image? "Eli Dupree - 25 min sketch"? It took me 25 minutes to draw that. And writing the prose line took about 25 seconds. Granted, I'm not very experienced at this right now, and I'll speed up with practice, and in any case it would be quicker to draw if it was an established character of mine rather than someone I had to invent on the spot, but anyway, the point is: Graphic stories are quicker to <em>read</em>, but they're much slower to create.</p>

<p>There's a reason I picked the phrase <em>condensed format</em>: In both prose and graphic storytelling, you start with the same set of cool ideas, but with graphic storytelling, you cram those ideas into a smaller package that the reader can consume more quickly and easily.</p>

<p>And that gets me to one of the really annoying questions about The Purpose Of Art. Because, like, I want to produce the best work possible. But I also want to <em>not</em> spend my whole lifetime on one piece. Because I could do a lot more than that if I just wrote things that weren't quite as good, but that I could write more quickly.</p>

<p>And that's a question that I don't have an answer to!</p>

<p>Incidentally, this post took about an hour to write, in addition to the sketching time.</p>

<p>So, I had my first classes today &ndash; a math class (Ordinary Differential Equations) and the first-year English Composition class. The math class was awesome. The English class wasn't.</p>

<p>Before I go on, let me make it clear that I'm not picking on this class or this professor in particular; I'll be naming specific things from this class, but I'm mainly doing that in order to talk about a general attitude about the study of English composition.</p>

<h2>Item 1: What Is Good Writing?</h2>

<p>First, the professor said that good prose was "a lot less subjective than you think". That's a laughable assertion, for two reasons. First, it assumes that everyone in the class has the same thoughts about the subjectivity of good prose. And that's a diversity issue, because we're in a society that actively discourages people from expressing opinions outside what's expected of them. Among the students, there are probably a wide variety of different opinions on how subjective prose-quality really is, and the professor will never know those opinions, because ze didn't wait and ask people's opinions; ze pushed zir own ideas onto the students, probably generalizing from zir own feelings when ze was a student.</p>

<p>Of course, the bigger point is that, well, "good prose" really <em>is</em> incredibly subjective.</p>

<p>But first, I'm going to jump back to the smaller point. Because I think the smaller point really <em>does</em> show the attitude behind thinking that prose-quality is subjective. Because <em>if you believe that everybody thinks in the same way, then you will believe that the same prose is good for everyone</em>. And so it privileges one way of thinking over all the others. An attitude that privileges "normal" thinking is the opposite of neurodiversity; it's <strong>neurelitism</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, let me tell you how subjective prose is!</p>

<p>But first, let me tell you why it makes any sense to talk about that in the first place. Because I actually have two options here: Either...</p><ol><li>I can decide that the phrase "good writing" doesn't actually mean anything.</li><li>I can decide that "good writing" <em>does</em> mean something, and then talk about what it means.</li></ol>

<p>A lot of people say they're taking the second option, but effectively take the first option. They say things like "I don't know how to explain what good writing is, but I know it when I see it". There's nothing wrong with a person using that definition for zemself, but it makes it impossible to have a detailed discussion about good writing. Sometimes that's all you can do, because sometimes your ideas just aren't well-formed enough to talk about, but here, it'd be nice to have a definition we can work with.</p>

<p>Guess what? I <em>do</em> have a definition we can work with!</p>

<p>Definition: <em>Good writing is writing that is effective for some purpose.</em> Writing that someone enjoys is good writing. Writing that influences someone's way of thinking is good writing. If I'm trying to sell pizza, writing that convinces people to buy pizza is good writing, and so on.</p>

<p>There, I defined it! Now, is this subjective?</p>

<p>Heck yes! If I write a super formal essay to give to a nine-year-old history student, my audience will probably find it boring, and hence I have failed as a writer. If I write an essay full of urban slang and show it to a college professor, it'll probably be outside the professor's reading-comfort-zone, so ze'll have trouble reading it, and hence I will have failed as a writer. And if I write an essay that's super formal when my audience is people who use urban slang all the time, it'll be less familiar to them, so the essay full of slang <em>would have been a better essay,</em> and it would be better <em>in a way that is clearly visible.</em></p>

<p>The institution of Prestigious-University-English doesn't agree with me. It thinks that there's one specific style of English that's more important than the others. And that's bad, because privileging one style of English over the others also privileges one group of people over the others. If "grammatically correct" English is the dominant form of the language used, that marginalizes anyone who can't (or won't) read that style easily. It's sort of like going to a bilingual community and saying that English is correct and Spanish is incorrect. Sure, an English class is going to teach English and not Spanish, and that's not a problem, but it <em>is</em> a problem if it teaches that "English is how you're supposed to write, and Spanish is unnecessary". And that's exactly what the college is doing by requiring an English Composition (i.e. Formal English Composition) class, while not requiring an Informal English Composition class.<footnote((There are some things that are important in both formal and informal English, and we'll presumably be learning some of those things in this class, too. So far, though, it's only been about the formal stuff.))></p>

<h2>Item 2: What are the rules, and why?</h2>

<p>My English professor has an opinion about what the rules of English grammar are. I happen to disagree with zem on a variety of points.</p>

<p>One, there's no such thing as formal rules of English grammar. The meaning of language is defined by how people use it and how people understand it, not by how someone <em>else</em> says it's supposed to be used or understood. General guidelines help people understand each other, but when it comes to hard-and-fast rules, there just aren't any. Trying to assign rules is called <strong>prescriptivism</strong>, because you're <em>prescribing</em> what the rules should be, rather than watching how they develop on their own. Saying what the rules/guidelines <em>seem to be</em>, by observing how the language is actually used, is called <strong>descriptivism</strong>. I am a descriptivist, and I dislike prescriptivism (as you've probably figured out already!).</p>

<p>Take this blog, for instance. It's full of grammatical "errors". Of course, they're not actually errors, since most of them are intentional. Some of them are just colloquialisms, like when I begin a sentence with "So, ..."; those ones are <em>informal</em> grammar, not incorrect grammar. How do I know it's correct? Simple: Because that's how people use it, and usage defines the rules!</p>

<p>Some of my other "errors" are there for bigger reasons. For instance, I bet most English professors wouldn't consider "ze" to be proper English. Or they think that you should always put punctuation <em>inside</em> a quotation mark. That's "grammatically correct", but logically incorrect, because <em>you're not quoting the punctuation and so logically it shouldn't be inside the quote marks.</em> That's kind of obvious; the only reason to do it the other way is because the other way is conventional, which is really not a reason at all, since doing it this way is just as easy to understand.</p>

<p>That makes me a <strong>revisionist</strong> &ndash; I don't just observe the evolution of language and try to copy it, I actively participate in the evolution of language, by favoring words and grammatical structures that I think make the language work better. English is hardly a perfect language, and it has a lot of limitations, so anybody who isn't willing to change the language is limited in what ze can say. By adding words and phrases like "ze", "lateral thinking", "lol", and so forth (just to give a few examples of words/phrases that have been invented and added to the language recently), we're not commiting <em>errors that make bad writing</em> &ndash; we're improving the language and thereby making our writting <em>better</em> than ever before!</p>

<p>My professor gave the usual line of "You need to know the rules in order to break them... Great writers know the rules, and they sometimes break the rules, but they do it for a reason". Which is a statement that has <em>some</em> merit; after all, most of the "rules of grammar" are actually good ideas, and I think it's good to follow most of them (the thing I don't agree with is if someone tries to <em>enforce</em> the rules). On the other hand, I disagree with it from a factual perspective. A lot of historical "great writers" didn't respect, or even necessarily <em>know</em>, the "rules". Here's a quote from Joan Didion, whom lots of English-department-type people consider a great writer:</p>

<blockquote>Grammar is a piano I play by ear, since I seem to have been out of school the year the rules were mentioned. All I know about grammar is its infinite power.</blockquote>

<p>This quote is wonderful! (And I also happen to think that Joan Didion's writing is great in general.) Because that's the way grammar really works &ndash; I mean, I'm an abstract mathematician, and I love formalizing things, but even <em>I</em> don't read text in a purely formal way. People read text in an intuitive way, and so the way to be really good at constructing sentences is to be really good at that intuition. And there are lots of different ways to learn that intuition. Some people can learn it by studying and understanding formal rules, but other people learn it by consciously immersing themself in the everyday use of the language. Nobody becomes fluent in a foreign language by studying the formal rules, so why should we expect a person to become excellent in zir own language by that means?</p>

<h2>Item 3: Where do we go from here?</h2>

<p>My professor gave a few examples of where you need to be able to write formal English: Applications for graduate school. Job applications. College classes (which give you grades, and grades basically only affect your applications to graduate schools and jobs).</p>

<p>You know what those have in common?</p>

<p><em>They're all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum games</a>.</em> If you get the scholarship, someone else loses the scholarship. If you get the job, someone else doesn't get the job. And most jobs don't actually require formal writing. Some public-relations jobs require writing, but that writing should be a lot less formal. Jobs in the sciences require a lot of writing, but &ndash; although there's a lot of overlap &ndash; science writing is very different than the "formal English" that they teach in English departments. In short &ndash; as I've been saying for this whole post &ndash; writing should be done <em>for a purpose</em>. And when you teach writing, you should teach how to best use the tools of writing to achieve a purpose, rather than teaching how to best fit within the mold given to you by centuries of prescriptivists.<footnote((Did you notice that this sentence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_infinitive">split two infinitives</a>? I hope you didn't, because noticing that would be distracting, which is bad, but it's also mainly your own fault for being oversensitive to innocent grammar. I happen to think that it works best the way I wrote it. Because if I un-split the infinitive, I get "how best to..." and that's hard to read, because people are familiar with seeing the phrase "how to", and the "best" confuses it. I didn't make that choice because I was conscious of the "don't split infinitives" rule and was breaking it for a reason; I did it because I was ignoring the rule, because the rule is pointless and stupid.))></p>

<p>This might be a little silly, but I'm going to use this blog as an example again. This blog is here to express ideas. I write this blog because I have lots of cool ideas and I want other people to benefit from them. Since I don't want to exclude anyone, I try to use the most neutral, accessible language that I can. Sometimes that's difficult, because my ideas are complicated, and so I sometimes need to use complicated language. And sometimes I need to use a specific term (like "zero-sum game" &ndash; it's important to use that phrase because there's no other concise term for the concept). And sometimes I just don't come up with the right way to express an idea, and I end up writing an awkward sentence instead. But the point is &ndash; when I fail, it's because I fail at my intended purpose. When I succeed, it's because I fulfilled my intended purpose.</p>

<p>Both of those things are <em>related</em> to the grammar and style that English classes teach, but the purpose must come first, and the style must come second.</p>

<p>Some moderately bad things happened, and I ended up dropping the English Composition class that I was taking. (I'm still considering what to replace it with &ndash; maybe another English Comp from a different professor, maybe another class entirely.) I'm not going to go into the details, but it was bad. So you might assume that I'd still be frustrated about it. But, I'm totally not! This post is about how I manage to not stay frustrated about things.</p>

<p>Now, you might be thinking "Aha! Eli probably has some sort of magical brain difference where ze just doesn't get frustrated in the first place!", which would be a good guess because my brain has lots of awesome powers, but no. A long time ago, I <em>did</em> have a tendency to get really frustrated by stuff, and now I don't, because I approach things in a different way.</p>

<p>Let's take an example!</p>

<p>Case 1: Suppose there's a class that I have to take (probably a grade-school class, not a college class). And in the classroom, there is a buzzing insect. "BUZZ. BUZZ. I WILL ANNOY YOU AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE," says the insect. It makes me frustrated as all hell. I just wanted to take the class without an insect, but I'm stuck with the insect, which is horrible.</p>

<p>Case 2: Suppose there's a class that I can take if I want to, but don't have to take (probably a summer class that doesn't offer credit I need for anything). And I know there's an insect that hangs around in the room (pretend we can't get rid of it for some reason). But if I go to the class knowing there's an insect there, I'll be thinking "Okay, I know that thing is there, so I can deal with it."</p>

<p>See the difference here? In Case 1, I'm comparing "class without insect" to "class with insect", so I'm annoyed because I got the worse option. In Case 2, I'm comparing "no class" to "class with insect" &ndash; and if I go to class, I must have decided that "class with insect" was the <em>better</em> option &ndash; and since I decided that I was okay with not taking the class, I must logically be okay with taking the class with the insect (since it's better than something I already knew I was okay with).</p>

<p>I stopped being frustrated with things when I decided that I'm <em>never</em> in Case 1 and <em>always</em> in Case 2. I can always choose to leave the class.</p>

<p>What if I need the class to graduate? I can always choose not to graduate.</p>

<p>What if the law compels me to take the class? I can always choose to break the law. It has downsides, but it's <em>still an option on the table</em>. Because...</p>

<p>What if the frustrating thing is something I need to do in order to survive? <em>I can always choose not to survive.</em></p>

<p>So I ask myself, "Which would I prefer: To die, or to live?" And then I think "Given the ways of living available to me, I think I'd rather live. So let's figure out the best way to handle it."<footnote((Unfortunately, this might not work for you if some bits of your brain are yelling "No! I'd rather die!". Works for me, though; I've had suicidal thoughts in the past, but even then, most of the bits of my brain were good at cooperating with each other, so they could think clearly despite that.))> And dying is basically just nothing, and nothingness is a neutral thing, not a negative thing. Which implies that, since I choose to live, my life must be good. Not just "okay", but <em>good!</em></p>

<p>I'm glad my life is good, and I wish more people had good lives!<footnote((Note that this does NOT imply that my life as a whole has been good, just that my life at the current moment is good. The fact that my life is good now does NOT MAKE IT OKAY that my former selves suffered a lot.))></p>

<h2>Oh, another thing!</h2>

<p>I have this concept that I call "freedom through obligation".</p>

<p>Sounds like a contradiction, right?</p>

<p>Think about the idea of "freedom of speech". Literally, it means that you're free to express whatever opinion you want. But, well, most people <em>literally</em> are physically capable of saying whatever they want, so what does it really mean? Or, to put it another way &ndash; freedom <em>from what?</em></p>

<p>I suppose it means freedom from negative consequences of speech.</p>

<p>But that's ridiculously impossible. The <em>point</em> of stating an opinion is to affect other people in some way, and affecting people will always have consequences; if there weren't consequences, there'd be no reason to do it, because it would be a meaningless action. And that means that, even if you won't get arrested for saying the wrong thing, you might still end up annoying someone who later decides whether to give you a job or not. Or convincing someone to follow their dreams, when they were planning to give you lots of money instead. Or whatever.</p>

<p>So, as long as you're paying attention to the consequences, you never have complete, free-wheeling freedom of speech.</p>

<p>But, suppose you were under absolute, incontrovertible orders to ignore the consequences &ndash; the "obligation" part of <em>freedom through obligation</em>. Then you'd have complete freedom: being concerned about the consequences would never even enter your decision process, and so you'd end up deciding to say what you innately want to say. That's ironic, of course, because normally having an extra obligation restricts your freedom. But in this case, one freedom interferes with another.</p>

<p>Here's a simpler example: I had a bad habit once &ndash; something like cracking my knuckles. Then I decided not to do it anymore, and I stopped. By <em>taking away</em> my freedom to pursue short-term comfort (by continuing the habit), I <em>gained</em> the freedom to choose which long-term habits I keep and which ones I discard. Once again &ndash; freedom through obligation.</p>

<p>This blog is similar to the first example. It's public and has my name attached, so people can discriminate against me in real life for the things I say here. But I'm sworn to ignore their discrimination, so I can say whatever I want to say. It's similar to my moral principles, actually. I will not do something I know to be evil, even if I benefit a lot from doing so &ndash; and I will not compromise my voice, even if I benefit a lot from doing so.</p>

<h2>Wait, what does that have to do with the first thing?</h2>

<p>Both of these things are conceptually related to the ideas of <em>leaving undesirable options on the table</em> and <em>how you choose between two undesirable options</em>.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a moral principle. Like, "I will not kick dogs; kicking dogs is completely evil and depraved". And then you go to university for four years, and you're about to graduate, and then the president of your university decides to establish a policy that every student, as part of zir graduation ceremony, must kick a dog, or else ze wouldn't receive a diploma. If you took "drop out" off the table, then you're now stuck with kicking the dog and living with the guilt for the rest of your life. And you (well, some people) can be sucked into doing that even if you think "don't kick dogs" is your highest principle, because at that moment, you aren't thinking about your principles &ndash; you're thinking "I need to finish this ceremony". But if you're ever-conscious of your ability to drop out, even in the middle of your graduation, then you have the power to uphold your principles, because it's just a matter of taking the option that's better than the other option &ndash; in this case, the thing you were obligated to do rather than the thing you merely would have liked to do.</p>

<p>And, um, that might have been this blog's most ridiculous analogy yet!</p>

<p>On a less ridiculous note, I should probably tell you how this stuff affected my interactions with the abusive adults from my grade schools (in this case, ages 10-14). But this post has gone on long enough, and telling you about <em>them</em> probably deserves its own post.</p>

<p>(This post is basically just a list of things. I could have written about each of these things individually, but I'm having some health issues right now, and so I don't have the time-and-energy to write nicely about all of them.)</p>

<p>This weekend, I participated in the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin<footnote((Those are names of colleges. I attend Colby College.))> Festival of Live Performance and Digital Media! That was a weekend-long event where three groups of six students each developed a 5-10 minute theatrical/dance performance that incorporated cameras, projectors, sound effects, and such stuff, all controlled through computer input. It was pretty awesome, and I hope I'll be able to work with some of this equipment more in the future. The faculty in charge made video recordings of all three performances; if they have time, and can get permission from all the right people, then I might be able to show you them.</p>

<p>I recently found a really nice interview with a person who's studying addiction, brain development, and mental illness. It's <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/5/30/dr_gabor_mat_on_the_stress">the first interview on this page</a>, and it's 14 minutes long. A transcript is available. (I don't recommend the other two interviews in the video, but I couldn't find anywhere that the first interview was shown on its own.)</p>

<p>What happened with my seeking-another-course-to-take is this: The English department waived my English Composition requirement, so I don't have to take any version of that class. Then I didn't find another class to take, so I'm now taking three classes<footnote((Well, two classes and an independent study.))> instead of the usual four. That's actually kinda nice, because it gives me more time to do other things, like my comics.</p>

<p>I'm still planning to post my novella as soon as I can, but my current health issue is making me too distracted to work. (Don't worry, it's temporary, but it's awfully annoying while it's here.) Ditto for posting comics on my regular schedule &ndash; we'll see how things are going by Saturday.</p>

<p>This post is to give you some insight into how my creative process works!</p>

<p>So... Instinct vs. intellectual understanding. Complex ideas are great. The only trouble with complex ideas is that you can't keep the whole idea in your conscious mind at the same time. So you need to just rely on the knowledge you already have, so you can build on it. The things you're thinking about actively, I call "intellectual understanding"; the things you already know, that you can use without thinking, I call "instinct".</p>

<p>Of course, it's a good idea to go back and examine your instincts, from time to time.</p>

<p>I drew <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/main/posts/128-a-couple-of-badass-superheroes-page-5">my last comic</a> mostly by instinct. Especially the panel borders. I didn't think "What do I want this line to express and how do I accomplish that?"; I just thought "Hmm, this line doesn't look right... *redraw* ehh... *redraw* ooh, this works!". In short, I had an instinct for what I wanted, but I didn't intellectually understand exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>I love understanding things, so after I drew the comic, I went back and analyzed my own work! Here are some of my thoughts:</p>

<ul><li>The flared border at the bottom of the second panel echoes the powers Tritia's using in that panel. It makes the concept clear that Tritia is having an effect on stuff, especially with the way it stabs into the larger image below.</li><li>The way the last panel is drawn "in front" of the others give it more emphasis (which is good, because part of the joke is the fact that such a mundane statement gets so much emphasis). It also puts it slightly outside the flow of the story, which is good, because the main flow is the fight with Tritia.</li><li>The way Jeva's katana ignores panel borders. It's a bit of a running joke to draw the katana above things that it would normally be drawn below, but it also works for me here &ndash; in the first panel, it helps capture the interrupted-ness of the continuation from the previous page, and in the last panel, it helps accentuate Jeva's droopy-ness. If it was in the panel, I'd have to move the speech bubble up, and anyway, having things break the normal rules usually helps emphasize them. Oh! And I hadn't even thought about the fact that putting the speech bubble at the bottom, curving down, added to the overall effect of that panel.</li><li>Some other things didn't work so well. For instance, there's no good reason for Sam's speech bubble to be all the way at the right side; it confuses the flow a little. That's something I can keep in mind when watching my habits of where I put speech bubbles. I also should have found a way to indicate more motion in the crevices (bits still falling off, perhaps?), to make it clear that Tritia just dug them. As it stands, you might think that they were there the whole time.</li></ul>

<p>Anyway, one of the interesting things here is this: I'm finding it just as productive to study my own work as to study someone else's. That makes sense right now, because I've read a lot of comics already, but haven't written very many of them myself... yet!</p>

<transcript((ELI: Hello, folks!
Let's talk about affirmative consent,
and the myth of a "grey area" between
consensual sex and rape!
Consent is actually fairly straightforward,
but people don't always explain it perfectly.
Here, I'll explain it with an image!<br/>
<br/>
Panel: Two cheerful people.<br/>
PERSON 1: Want to have sex?<br/>
PERSON 2: Yeah! Let's do it!<br/>
This panel is labeled "CONSENT".<br/>
<br/>
Panel: A cheerful person and an idle person.<br/>
PERSON 1: Want to have sex?<br/>
PERSON 2: Yeah, whatever.<br/>
This panel is labeled "NOT CONSENT".<br/>
<br/>
ELI: This isn't very hard to understand.
If you ask someone fifty times,
and ze says no fifty times, and then you ask a fifty-first time and ze says yes, that is not consent. Compliance is not consent.
Compliance means that someone has decided that the trouble you'll cause for zem if ze doesn't comply is greater than the trouble of being sexed up when ze doesn't want it.
Which is exactly the opposite of the positive, mutually beneficial relationship you want with a sex partner.
Is there a grey area here?
Yes - it looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
Wide panel: At the left end is a cloud of grey smoke. At the right end is clear blue sky. The left end is labeled "GREY AREA"; the right end is labeled "CLEAR AREA".<br/>
PERSON IN THE GREY AREA: Oh, no!
With all this smoke around,
I have no idea if ze actually
wants to have sex
with me!<br/>
PERSON IN THE CLEAR AREA: Thank goodness!
My partner and I are
communicating well and
we both know exactly
what the other
wants!<br/>
<br/>
ELI: <strong>The grey area is the bad area.</strong>
The grey area is the one you want to
avoid at all costs.
The clear area is the
awesome area of super
sexy fun.
If you do sex to someone
while you're in the grey area, you might
not ever know whether you've committed rape.
That would be an incredibly stressful situation
to put yourself into.
You'd probably have a lot of cognitive dissonance
because you don't want to think of yourself that way.
And that would be very bad for you as well
as for your potential victim.
But the point here is not
"If you're in the grey area, don't have sex";
although that is important...
the point is,
<strong>"If you're in the grey area... get to the clear area."</strong><br/>
<br/>
Panel: Two people talking.<br/>
PERSON 1: I'm having a little trouble
figuring out what you're okay with - sometimes
I don't know if you're protesting or just playing
around...
So, um... Are you
interested in making out
for a while, and then
having sex?<br/>
PERSON 2: Oh, that would be
wonderful! Sorry, I've
just had a bad day and so
I'm a bit snippy. I could
really use some good sex
right now!<br/>
NARRATION: They then proceeded to have
the awesomest sex ever.<br/>
<br/>
ELI: Clear, honest communication
is the only weapon we have against
accidentally hurting each other over
and over for no good reason.
And it's also the sexiest thing
since vibrating dildos.
Use it.))>

<p>This is something that I should have blogged about long ago!</p>

<p>The story starts on March 9, 2011. There was a campus forum on that day, on the topic of "Gender, Power, and Community" &ndash; lots of people were there, and we had a really good conversation about a lot of important issues, like sexual assault, silencing, and various forms of discrimination. I said, semi-jokingly, something like "We should have a 'Colby Sex Club' where people talk about the act of sex and what we want out of it! This seems like another silence that needs to be broken." I dropped the idea at the time, because I was busy with schoolwork, and because as a person who's never actually had sex with another person, I didn't feel like the most qualified to start it.</p>

<p>Then, this semester &ndash; October 19, to be precise &ndash; I went to an event that made me think of it again. Heather Pratt, an dedicated feminist leader who graduated from Colby last year, gave a talk about zir thesis, which was about sexual assault at Colby. Ze talked about a lot of specific cases, and they all seemed to have one thing in common &ndash; <em>nobody knew what the fuck they were doing</em>. People didn't know what consent was, didn't know what their options were, didn't know how to have enjoyable sex, and so forth. Both the victims and the perpetrators were trying to do what they thought was expected of them, not even thinking about what they actually wanted for themselves.</p>

<p>So then I got irritated by how terrible that is, and decided that I was going to start the Sex Club after all!</p>

<p>And then I did it.<footnote((Well, first, I spent a long time trying to plan to do it collectively with a couple of other people. They're wonderful people, but they had a lot of other stuff going on, and it didn't work out. So, eventually, I just set a time for the first meeting and stuck to it, even though I didn't have any co-leaders.))> Last Friday, December 2, we had our first meeting &ndash; not too many people were there, because it's near the end of the semester and people have tons of work to do, but we had a good conversation with the people there, and there's been a huge amount of energy on campus about the club. The conversation covered a bunch of different subjects, including how to ask for what you want and how to tell someone you're interested in them without being too awkward. (That's a problem at Colby and elsewhere &ndash; our culture is so filled with images of nonconsent that some people feel awkward if someone actually just asks "Is it okay with you if we [kiss / make out / have sex / whatever]?". Once you start asking, though, it's much nicer for everybody!)</p>

<p>We have a mission statement:</p>

<blockquote>The Colby Sex Club is a safe space for candid discussions about sex. We are inclusive of all genders, sexes, preferences, and so forth. We push the idea of enthusiastic consent, and encourage people to have healthier, better, more communicative sex. We stand against sexual assault, and will support survivors however we can.</blockquote>

  "tags":["announcements","Lasercake"],
  "contents":'''

<p>[Update: This project now has its own website at <a href="http://www.lasercake.net/">lasercake.net</a>]</p>

<p>I wrote the following (slightly edited for the web) as part of an application for the "Senior Scholars" program here at Colby College, which will allow me to earn academic credit for doing this project.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Lasercake is an educational computer game project.</p>

<p>As a game, Lasercake will be a open "sandbox" game – one where the player is presented with a world to experiment in, rather than given a specific goal to accomplish as effectively as possible. As an educational project, the game environment will give the player numerous opportunities to encounter real-world science within the context of an industrial empire that the player is allowed to create.</p>

<p>It has become very clear how much potential there is for learning in computer games like this. One of the inspirations of this project is the SimCity series of games, in which the player takes on the role of a city planner, and develops a city by assigning zoning and building roads, power plants, and other city infrastructure. Research on SimCity has shown that it significantly alters how players understand city infrastructure and management (Tanesa and Cemalcilar, 2010) and is consistently useful, despite certain limitations, as an educational tool (Gaber, 2007). I recall playing SimCity 2000 while growing up, and it was a valuable contributor to the perspective that I have now. Active participation in a virtual world allows people to develop knowledge in a way that passively receiving information cannot (Annetta, 2010). So there is a great, unseen need for games that can present understandings of other systems within our world – especially when the commercial game industry seems uninterested in creating such games, and consistently presents unrealistic or imaginary science. (I happen to believe that there are many ways in which even commercial games help kids' intellectual development, it's just that presenting accurate science isn't one of them.) Lasercake, by contrast, will attempt to use accurate science as a way to promote an understanding of energy and ecological issues.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul><li>All the player's power generators, robots, lasers, factories, and so forth use real-world energy quantities, with joules as the basic unit. Time, distance, and other quantities are also measured in SI units, and are consistent throughout (for example, a hydroelectric power generator extracts the actual amount of potential energy that you can compute would be stored in the volume of water that passes through it, and the game tutorials will emphasize this aspect while they explain how you build the generators).</li>
<li>Most games that offer the player a way to dig in the ground simply have the rock disappear in front of the player's digging equipment. In Lasercake, by contrast, the mine waste has to be hauled out of the mountain and left somewhere, where it will pollute the surrounding land and water and disrupt the local ecosystem. There will be multiple systems (water cycle, temperature, flora, fauna...) – each implemented in a relatively simple way in its own right, so that it can simulate very quickly and the player can come to understand it without excessive explanation (and, as it might bear acknowledging, so that I can implement all of them within the relatively short timetable of one year).</li></ul>

<p>Again, this is all in the context of an expansive world where the player can build at their own pace. Since it doesn’t have a specific goal where you win or lose, it can appeal to a wide range of players – newcomers won’t have to worry about their ability to be successful, power gamers will find the range of options in the game wide enough to build incredibly awesome things, and almost everyone can appreciate the fun of being able to build their own high-tech establishment full of robots and lasers. These are many of the attributes that made the SimCity series such a success as well.</p>

<p>There will be a series of in-game tutorials (or more accurately, a web of them) that introduce the game concepts, and the science behind them, in an intuitive way.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have already begun work on the technical side of Lasercake, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.idupree.com/">my sibling, Isaac</a>. We worked together for three weeks during last winter break and part of January to implement the most complicated parts of the physics; we have a working demo that I've showed to the professors who will be involved in the project. Isaac and I work very effectively together, and we will continue to collaborate on this project throughout the upcoming year. We have made extensive plans for how to accomplish all of the things written above.</p>

<p>Lasercake is multi-platform; it is written in the programming language C++ and uses OpenGL for graphics, which both work on all major operating systems. Some of the new web technologies currently being popularized will also enable us to run the game simulation on a server and allow anyone to play through a web browser.</p>

<p>Isaac and I both literally grew up doing computer programming, including experimenting with how different systems behave depending on the rules one sets for them. We have extensive knowledge of the things included in the technical side of this project. Both of us have contributed to many open-source software communities; Isaac has also studied software development at Marlboro College, participated in Google Summer of Code, and interned at Fog Creek Software.</p>

<p>From the environmental-science side of things, although I haven't made that part of my academic study at Colby College, I do my best to follow environmental activism and stay informed through a variety of channels – not least of which is my family, all of whom take a great interest in the sciences. My high school education gave me a very good background for this area, with an AP Biology teacher who made zir course very in-depth and aware, as well as the most advanced classes available in physics and chemistry. Isaac also brings valuable knowledge; ze has studied environmental science academically at Marlboro College, ze helped me develop the ideas explained above, and ze has chaired Marlboro's Environmental Quality Committee.</p>

<p>The course I took this January, "Creating Media for Social Change", has had a significant influence on this project; if there were more courses on that subject, I would certainly have taken them. Theater design classes both here and in high school have helped me develop a way of thinking about how to present ideas through visual images. Anyone who knows me more than as a passing acquaintance knows my interest in how to construct a wide variety of media in order to promote new understanding.</p>

<p>Since this is a very multi-disciplinary, ambitious project, the Senior Scholars program seemed like a natural avenue in which to pursue it.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>The timeline I anticipate is as follows:</p>

<p>Isaac and I will work on Lasercake throughout the summer. By the time I return to Colby in the fall, it should be in a state where most or all of the game systems exist at least in a rudimentary way, so that, once at Colby, I can concentrate on what I consider the true meat of this project: developing the ways in which the user can interact with the game, and refining the game in order to best communicate the understanding that I intend to communicate. This refinement involves both the game mechanics (i.e. what happens in the game and what the user is able to do) and the tutorials through which the game presents those mechanics.</p>

<p>I'm at a bit of a loss to provide a monthly timetable, because of the essential way that this project involves figuring out what will have the desired effect as much as it involves creating something that I already understand. It will be steered by the feedback I get – and I will present it both to other students here at Colby, and to students at in the 4-6th grades in two local school districts. The project isn't locked into one course, because it will – must – be able to adapt to accommodate (or abandon) to the points at which it fails to communicate, and to fully pursue any way in which it's particularly effective.</p>

<p>Lasercake will also operate on the mantra of the dominant Free-and-Open-Source-Software development model: "Release early, release often." We already have <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/Lasercake">a repository on GitHub</a> (a website used for collaborative work on open-source projects), and our code is licensed under the GNU GPL, a Free Software license that allows people to view the source code and create their own versions, but prohibits them from taking advantage of the "share-alike" system by imposing additional restrictions on their versions or hiding their code modifications. In this way, Lasercake is part of the larger Free Software community, which is usually a very supportive community where people are eager to collaborate and offer their different skills to any project that seems worth contributing to. By having a transparent development process and frequent release schedule, we can let people outside the project follow what we're doing and offer feedback or even contributions.</p>

<p>By the end of the year, I hope to have developed Lasercake to the point where I am ready to reach out to schools and educators to offer Lasercake as a way for students to engage in science and scientific thinking.</p>

<p>I wrote this for a discussion on an Internet forum, in response to a person saying that it was "disrespectful" to violate social standards about what clothing to wear in specific situations.</p>

<p>It's easy for you to say that if you have the <em>ability</em> to conform to those social standards of dress (either at all, or without going to prohibitively large amounts of effort).</p>

<p>For instance, "dressing up" is a (not entirely anymore, but still mostly) gender-segregated thing: There isn't a way "to dress up", there's a way "to dress up male" and a way "to dress up female". This causes me two problems:</p>
<ol><li>Since I'm agendered, there is no possible way for me to dress up.</li>
<li>Even if I could, I wouldn't, because I hate gendered conventions with a fiery passion.</li></ol>
I personally deal with this by never going to a venue that requires me to dress up, but not everybody has the luxury of being able to avoid such venues.

<p>And to some people, "dress up" means "buy an extra garment you can ill afford".</p>
<p>Or "Battle your depression into letting you spend lots of effort dealing with clothes and body stuff, using energy you would rather have spent on the actual task".</p>
<p>Or "Spend all day trying to overcome social anxiety to go ask some social person to help you choose clothing because you cannot seem to understand what the conventions are".</p>
<p>Or many other things.</p>

<p>My moral system says it's intolerable to pressure someone into doing the above things merely to make them look "nicer", so I cannot agree with a set of conventions that does that. So maybe there are two options left:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha"><li>Pressure people to do that if it's easy for them, but don't pressure people if it's too hard for them;</li>
<li>View clothing conventions as optional and don't pressure anybody to do them.</li></ol>
<p>Option A is completely impossible, since you cannot actually know how hard it is for people (unless you're going to go around asking them all the time, which would be a total waste of effort and probably a form of pressure in itself). So, lacking any other choice that isn't repugnant to me, I take option B.</p>''',

<p>I haven't blogged in more than a year, but that will now change!</p>

<p>A little after my last blog post, I strained my wrist by programming for eight hours and drawing comics for five hours every day for a week. For a few months, I could barely type &ndash; so I stopped blogging, and when I got better, I was busy with other things. Like college. I graduated from Colby College this year, and despite its many structural problems, I think I managed to squeeze a good education from it.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about some of the things I've done in the last year. Leave a comment to tell me which ones you want to hear more about!</p>

<h2>Before this summer</h2>

<p>Watched a lot of anime. Solved all the levels of <a href="http://fillets.sourceforge.net/">Fish Fillets</a>. Got paid to tutor some people in math. Did a lighting design for a short dance piece. Worked on <a href="http://www.lasercake.net">Lasercake</a> a lot and released a prototype. Did BDSM with a partner for the first time. Ran a tabletop RPG for the first time. Played a tabletop RPG for the first time. Learned (and invented!) some useful knots. Wrote a 10-minute play and had it produced by the Colby theater department. Participated in some student activism. Built an exellent new device to carry my stuff around in. Initiated five other people into Eli Dupree's Cult of DOOM. Designed a sexual board game, and learned a lot about <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape<a> to do it.</p>

<h2>Since the beginning of this summer (May 18)</h2>

<p>I'm at home now, with nothing but free time to do awesome projects all the time!</p>

<p>Reorganized my room. Reorganized my computer stuff. Started improving my diet, inspired by <a href="http://soylent.me/">Rob Rhinehart's "Soylent" project</a>. Learned to use a sewing machine. Got back to working on my comic. Started using an EMG biofeedback device to help me draw without clenching my hand. Set up an exercise bicycle we have and improved my bicycle endurance a lot. Continued work on Lasercake and the board game. Updated a <a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/">Battle for Wesnoth</a> add-on (<q>Era of High Sorcery</q>) that I wrote years ago. Bought a used monitor, built a wooden shelf, and rearranged my workstation <a href="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/workstation_2013_06_04.jpg">[picture]</a>.</p>

<h2>Some things I'm going to do soon</h2>

<p>I'm going to finish <i>Voldemort's Children</i>, finally. It will probably take me at least a month, and I'm going to do all the remaining pages as a batch (so I won't be able to post any until it is all finished). But it is coming!</p>

<p>I'll redesign this website a bunch. Writing it from scratch two summers ago was a great experience, but now that I've used it for a while, I've seen a bunch of flaws in its current design.</p>

<p>I'll leave it at that for now. I don't know what else I'll do next, because there are so <em>many</em> different things I want to do next! But you will hear from me soon. I will blog more, I promise! I'm going to try to post at least one awesome thing each week, possibly more.</p>''',

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://soylent.me/">Rob Rhinehart's "Soylent" project</a>, I've been changing my diet. I'm trying to improve three aspects: Nutrition, portability, and price.</p>

<p>I've always had problems with eating. I don't <em>like</em> eating food, so I often don't eat enough of it. And I'm extremely sensitive to taste, so most foods are overwhelmingly strong and I can't eat them. Between those two things, I don't try new foods very often.</p>

<p>Previously, the main parts of my diet were rice, cheese, apple juice, and a multivitamin. For such a limited diet, that's not bad. But it's not great either. I think I was deficient a bunch of nutrients, including potassium. And the other downsides of cheese are that it needs to be refrigerated and that it's relatively expensive. The cheese I ate was costing more than $2 per day by itself, and all my food together cost about $4.18 per day. (All prices here are listed in US dollars and cents because that's the local currency.)</p>

<p>Replacing cheese wasn't easy, though. As far as I can tell, it was:</p><ul><li>my only source of protein</li><li>my only source of fat</li><li>my only source of sodium</li><li>my only source of calcium</li></ul>

<p>So what did I do?</p>

<h2>Building a new diet</h2>

<p>Well, I needed information. I got a lot of that from <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com">this website that lists food content</a href> and <a href="http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/">this tool to estimate my nutrient needs</a>, both of which are based on USDA data. (It could be better, but it's a lot more reliable than most nutrition information on the Internet.) Bear in mind that the nutrient needs are an approximate, and vary between people and environments. For instance, it recommends 2700 calories per day for someone of my height, weight, sex, and activity level, but when I'm eating the amount that feels right to me, I usually eat around 2300 calories (estimated).</p>

<p>Then I looked at the foods that are available cheaply at the local grocery store.</p>

<p>The ruler of calories-per-dollar is vegetable oil - it costs about 56 cents to get me 2300 calories. The downside of vegetable oil is that it has nothing <em>but</em> calories in it.</p>

<p>Next up are the grains - wheat flour, corn meal, rice, beans. They range from $1 to $2 for 2300 calories. They provide a lot of calories from carbohydrates, mostly complex carbs. The beans also provide a lot of protein, potassium, fiber, and a lot of the micronutrients as well.</p>

<p>I started eating black beans, which are very nutrient-dense and have a very bland taste.</p>

<p>As soon as I started eating black beans, my nose cleared up. My nose has always been stuffy &ndash; I've never been able to comfortably breathe through my nose, at least not if I want to get enough air. Now I can breathe through my nose easily &ndash; in fact, I was doing it without even noticing while I wrote this paragraph. I figure the stuffiness must have been a symptom of some nutrient deficiency.</p>

<p>So my new diet is based on black beans and canola oil. I also got a new multivitamin/multimineral pill that's more comprehensive than the one I was taking.</p>

<p>Black beans are about 25% protein by calorie. They aren't a "complete protein" in the strictest sense of the term, but I looked at their actual amino-acid content and the intake recommendations, and since I'm eating so much of them, I should meet all the recommended amounts. The main things still missing are sodium and calcium &ndash; the body needs too much of them to fit in a pill. Sodium is easy &ndash; I just add table salt. For some reason, I have no problem eating things that are very salty.</p>

<p>Most calcium-rich foods are much more expensive than the oil and beans. Some people take supplements in the form of purified calcium carbonate or calcium citrate, which are much cheaper (per calcium) than the foods. I was planning on doing that. But then I learned that eggshells, which are mostly calcium carbonate, are an effective source of calcium too. (But be careful - uncooked eggshells, like uncooked eggs, can carry salmonella, so make sure to cook them first.) One of my family members eats eggs frequently, so I'm having zem save zir eggshells to add to my meal.</p>

<p>In theory, if I eat nothing else, these ingredients will cost somewhere between $1.30 and $1.50 per day, and provide <em>all</em> the nutrition I need.</p>

<p>Problem: Black beans mixed with canola oil and eggshells were disgusting to eat. And cooked beans still require refrigeration. I had to do something about that.</p>

<h2>Preparing the new food</h2>

<p>I rarely leave my house. Part of the reason for that is that everything I need is here; the other part is that traveling is inconvenient. I want to eventually start going out more, so I'm working on making travel more convient. One thing I'm doing is training my bicycle endurance. Another is making a food that I can easily carry for a day without refrigeration.</p>

<p>To do that, I dehydrated the beans. Right now, I'm doing it by cooking them in an oven for about two hours at 250&deg;F (121&deg;C), opening the door sometimes to let out the steam. But I'm hoping to build a solar dehydrator to reduce the amount of heat it lets into the house (and also to save electricity).</p>

<p>Dried beans are very hard, which makes them difficult to eat. So I grind them into powder. I was lucky that we already have a hand-powered food grinder in the house. (We also have an ancient blender, but it's very loud, incovenient to clean, and makes an inconsistent product). I also throw the eggshells into the grinder with the beans, and get a bean powder / eggshell powder mix.</p>

<p>Both canola oil and dry bean powder can keep for a very long time without refrigeration.</p>

<p>When I want to eat it, I pour out some powder, add oil until it's not too dry to eat, and add salt. I get this:</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/new_food_2013_06_11.jpg" alt="a bowl full of dark, clumpy stuff, with a spoon in it" />

<p>It's pretty tasteless except for the salt. It sticks to itself a bit, so it's hard to spill, which makes it a good thing to snack on while I work. Although it would be even better if I could make it into crackers so that I don't need the bowl and spoon.</p>

<p>That amount is about half a meal. It's very high in calories-per-size (which makes it even better for travel) because it has essentially no water or air in it, and has a lot of fat in it. A full bowl of it would be more than a day's food.</p>

<p>I haven't switched over to eating this exclusively (and probably won't), but I'd like to try going for a few days on just this stuff to see how it works out.</p>

<p>Lastly, people say that you fart more if you eat lots of beans, but I haven't noticed myself farting much more than usual.</p>

<p>Following <a href="/main/posts/346-the-food-experiments">my last experiments</a>, I've been trying to put my bean/oil/eggshell mush into a more convenient form. I'm now eating this stuff for all my meals except breakfast each day.</p>

<p>At first, I tried baking using just the bean powder. The results were too crumbly to be practical, so I added wheat flour.  A family member suggested that, instead of dehydrating the cooked beans and then re-baking them, I could just mash the cooked beans in with the other ingredients before baking them. That also saves the trouble of grinding them. I tried it and got this:</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits_2013_06_16.jpg" alt="A cooling rack with about 16 lumpy biscuits on it" />

<p>(The colors are a bit off in that photo; the one on the far right is the closest to their actual color.)</p>

<p>These were pretty good - they're crunchy and a bit hard to chew, but I currently like that. I can still improve upon them, but the basic idea works great.</p>

<p>My recipe for this batch was:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 cups cooked beans</li>
<li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>eggshells (see below)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix together the ingredients in a bowl and mash them up (I used a tough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry_cutter">pastry cutter</a> for that). Knead thoroughly, roll and fold in thirds repeatedly, fold in half and roll into about 1/2 inch sheet, cut into biscuits and bake at 250&deg;F for 2 hours. (Biscuits are usually cooked at a higher temperature, but we think the higher temperature might destroy some of the nutrients, and there's no particular reason to do it.)</p>

<p>I used about one eggshell for this. Later that day, I received a milligram scale that I'd ordered, and massed an eggshell. It was about 6.1 grams, which should be about 2.2 grams of calcium<footnote((Eggshells are at least 90% calcium carbonate, and calcium carbonate is 40% calcium by mass. 6.1g eggshell * 0.9g CaCO<sub>3</sub>/g eggshell * 0.4g Ca/g CaCO<sub>3</sub> ~= 2.2g Ca.))>. This batch was about a day's food; the recommendation is one gram of calcium per day, and not more than 2.5 grams. Getting 2.2 from the eggshells is pushing it. Before I measured it, I had mistakenly thought the eggs had about half that much calcium. Well, good news: I can now use half as many eggshells, which is a closer match for how many eggs my family eats anyway!</p>

<p>The beans would otherwise become 1 cup of dried bean powder, so this recipe is essentially using a 1:1 ratio of bean to wheat &ndash; although the beans are still more calorie-dense and nutrient-dense at that volume. Earlier, I tried using less wheat, but the biscuits were still too crumbly. However, in those tests, I was also still using the gritty bean powder instead of whole moist beans, which might make a difference. More tests are in order.</p>

<p>The salt is a bit less than my formula calls for; I haven't been getting the recommended 1.5g/day of sodium, and my body hasn't been craving more. Maybe that's appropriate because I sweat less than the average person, both physically (I overheat fast because I don't sweat much in the heat) and behaviorally (I'm fairly inactive and I avoid heat as much as I can). I've heard that the body is fairly good at regulating its salt intake, so I'll pay attention to whether I start craving salt as time goes forward.</p>

<p>I used to carry my stuff &ndash; about eight pounds (3.6 kg) of it &ndash; like this:</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/old_case_over_shoulder_small.jpg" alt="A picture of me carrying a laptop case with a single shoulder strap over my right shoulder, with the case at my left side." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Or rather, it looked like that except that the case was puffed up more from all the stuff in it. I did that for about four years. Then on March 1, 2013, I started having some pain in my chest that got worse the more I carried that case. So I started carrying it like this:</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/old_case_around_waist_small.jpg" alt="A picture of me carrying the same case, but now the strap is wrapped around my waist, so that the center of it hangs in front of my left leg." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>That worked to relieve the pain. But it was also inconvenient to put on or take off. The strap didn't have clips on the ends<footnote((Actually, the strap <em>originally</em> had clips on <em>both</em> ends, and <em>both</em> of the clips broke during normal use. And the strap I'd had before that also had clips which broke. I no longer trust metal or plastic clips in positions that are both load-bearing and involve rubbing against other hard parts during normal use.))>, so I had to put the whole thing over my head every time I wanted to put it on or take it off. And it interfered with my walking (and worse, running), because it hung right in front of my leg. So, March 23-29, with some help from a family member, I designed and built this:</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/new_contraption_worn_small.jpg" alt="A picture of me putting on some sort of contraption that has pouches at the left and right sides"/><img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/new_contraption_worn_2.jpg" alt="Me wearing the same contraption, shown from a different angle"/>

<p>This thing works great!</p>

<p>You could ask, as many others have asked, <q>What <strong>is</strong> that?</q></p>

<p>Let's open up the flaps and look:</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/new_contraption_displayed.png" alt="A picture of me holding up the same contraption in one hand, with different parts labeled A through F." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<ol type="A">
  <li>A single alumnium flat, 1/8 in x 3/4 in x 4 ft, that holds up the pouches and goes around the back.</li>
  <li>Foam padding that rests on my hips, carrying the weight.</li>
  <li>Four straps (two on each side) with pairs of D-rings on them, so that the strap can be tightened to grip and hold arbitrary objects.</li>
  <li>A single strap across the front to hold it on. At one end is a pair of D-rings to adjust the tightness of the strap, and at the other end is a hook that goes over the aluminum frame. This strap is <em>not</em> the main support, and it doesn't even press against the front of my body very much (it's held out front by the frame).</li>
  <li>Two metal clips (one on each side) for holding light objects that can be clipped on, like hair ties and gloves (if the gloves have their own clips/loops on them).</li>
  <li>Vinyl<footnote((Not the best material in hindsight. The vinyl tears easily under stress. We just bought the thing that was both waterproof and on sale.))> with a felt-like backing, forming two big pouches to carry stuff in, little pouches that hold the foam in place, and flaps that go over the top to keep off the rain.</li>
</ol>

<p>For those interested, I've <a href="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/contraption_pattern.png">drawn a pattern</a> for the vinyl pieces. (I may not be remembering the numbers exactly, but the pattern should make it clear how the thing is put together.)</p>

<p>The entire thing weighs 2 pounds (0.9 kg) when it's empty, whereas the case I was using weighs 2.5 pounds empty. The materials cost us around $20 in total.</p>

<p>For most purposes, this has been exactly what I wanted: It carries my stuff, it doesn't strain my body, and it doesn't interfere with my movement. The two sides carry about the same amount of weight, so it's balanced and stays out of the way.</p>

<p>Not all of it worked, though. The D-ring straps, which were sewn directly to the vinyl, eventually lost their grip when the vinyl started to tear. The pouches slide back and forth annoyingly &ndash; I added a few binder clips to hold them in place, but those clips don't hold on very well. And when I run, I have to keep adjusting it so that it doesn't slide forward/backward off my hips.</p>

<p>All of those can be fixed in the next version I build. This was great as a prototype, and it served me well for two months. I had to make some other things to organize the stuff <em>inside</em> the pouches, but that's a matter for another post.</p>

<p>A bunch of people have told me "You should patent this and make millions", but I'm not a capitalist, so I encourage you all to make your own versions of this if you want to. When I make my own next version, I might write some detailed instructions for making your own, with a "Please leave a donation if you can afford it" attached.</p>

<p>I don't handle heat well. If it's above about 72&deg;F (23&deg;C), I stop being able to focus, I become very lethargic, and I get sleepy more easily, but I don't feel rested after sleeping. If it cools down again, I get better fairly quickly. I'd say it takes about 20 minutes to change my mental state, in either direction &ndash; although it's hard to measure.</p>

<p>Our house is normally cooled by a <a href="http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/heat-pump-water-heaters">heat pump water heater</a>. The one we had was broken. Then we replaced it. But I missed about a month's worth of work between when the heat started and when it cooled off.</p>

<p>Now I'm better, mostly. I've been working on a Javascript game project for the last week, although I don't have anything I can show to people yet.<footnote((I'm partially doing it as a prototype for part of Lasercake. So I'm working hard to make it robust internally, rather than making showy things.))></p>

<p>I'm still tired, though. When I go for a month without being excited about anything, it takes a while to get excited again. I'm not even impatient to finish VC, although I'm sure <em>that</em> feeling will come back before long.</p>

<p>I'll try to do the "post an awesome thing each week" thing again. To start with, I've done more experiments with biscuits that I should tell you about. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>I'm continuously updating the process for making <a href="/main/posts/348-i-made-biscuits">my biscuits</a>. A few batches ago, I took photos!</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-1.jpg" alt="Me holding two one-pound bags of beans over a counter; a metal pot is in the background." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I start with these one-pound bags of beans (two cups dry). For this batch I used two bags, but now I usually use three. I put the beans in the pot, then fill it with water to about three times the depth of the beans, and put it in a refrigerator to soak overnight.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-2.jpg" alt="Me holding lid on the pot, while I pour brownish water from it into the sink. (The water goes through the thin gap between the pot and the lid, so none of the beans come out.)" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Then in the morning, I pour off the water. Usually the water is less brown and more purple &ndash; I neglected to refrigerate this batch overnight. Good thing I didn't get sick from it.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-3.jpg" alt="The pot full of beans sits in the sink, with tapwater pouring into it." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I refill the water, then pour it out again, to rinse the beans. I repeat that a couple of times. I use hot water for this, so that the beans warm up (so they'll boil more quickly in the next step).</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-4.jpg" alt="The pot of beans sits on a stove, which has been turned on. A nearby timer reads '7:51'." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Then I boil the beans for half an hour on the electric stove you see here. Since this batch, I've started putting a teaspoonful of baking soda in with it, which makes the beans softer.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-5.jpg" alt="The back of my head. I'm using a hair tie to tie my hair back." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Remember to tie back your long hair before messing with sticky things!</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-6.jpg" alt="Three images: Me pouring whole wheat flour into a large metal bowl, me with two containers of salt, and me carefully pouring salt into a teaspoon above the bowl of flour." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>While I wait for the beans to finish boiling, I add the dry ingredients. For the usual amount (6 dry cups of beans), that's:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 cups whole wheat flour</li>
<li>2 tsp table salt</li>
<li>1 tsp potassium salt (KCl)</li>
<li>10 grams of eggshells (about two large eggshells)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since then, I've started adding quick oats to the mix, but I haven't settled on how much. I'll probably choose something like 3.5 cups flour, 4 cups quick oats. (The oats are less dense; by weight, 4 cups quick oats is the same as 2.5 cups whole wheat flour.)</p>

<p>I've also experimented with a bunch of other ingredients. I'll write about that at the end of this post.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-7.jpg" alt="My hand holding the pestle of a mortar-and-pestle about the same width as my hand." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I used to grind up the eggshells with this cute little mortar-and-pestle, and mix them with the other dry ingredients. Now I just throw them in with the beans and oil (see below). Hand-grinding them made smaller bits, but was a lot of work.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-8.jpg" alt="A food processor with a bunch of cooked beans in it." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>To help me mash the beans, I actually bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Processor-Compact-Storage/dp/B002V8RNH2/">this food processor</a>. I got a refurbished one for $43.<footnote((It came with a little card that said, essentially, "Thank you for buying refurbished products! We're not going to give you as much of a warranty as usual." It has worked quite well so far, even after I accidentally dropped it from the counter onto the floor.))> I've already saved more money by switching to this diet than I spent on this object. (These biscuits are now about 80% of the food I eat.)</p>

<p>There used to be a complex little ritual in here, in order to cool off the (just-boiled) beans enough to touch them, without letting them dry out and get tougher. Since I started using baking soda to soften them, I don't need to do that. Now I just pour them into a colander.</p>

<p>At first, there was a problem with using the food processor: a lot of the beans stuck to the plastic sides, so they didn't get chopped up.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-9.jpg" alt="Me pouring canola oil from a 1-gallon bottle into a metal 1-cup measure." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I solved that problem by putting the canola oil in with the beans before running the food processor. I'm aiming for 3 cups of oil total, in about 18 cups of wet beans. So I put in two cups of beans at a time, with one-third cup of oil. (That seems to be the quantity the food processor can handle best.) And now I also put in the eggshells in with the first two cups of beans, after I break them up a bit by hand.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-10.jpg" alt="The food processor again, now with beans mashed up." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Then I get this mess. It's been a lot smoother since I started using the baking soda to soften the beans.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-11.jpg" alt="Some mashed beans have been dumped into the bowl dry ingredients." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Then I dump them in with the dry ingredients. Eventually everything is in the bowl and I can mix it together.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-12.jpg" alt="A blurry image of my two hands stirring the ingredients together." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Mixing it is a challenge! Sometimes it is easier to use my hands directly than to use a spoon.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-13.jpg" alt="The lumpy dough dumped out on a counter." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Eventually I can dump it out on the counter and start kneading it.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-14.jpg" alt="My two hands pressing down on a piece of dough." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>After some kneading, it starts to become a coherent dough.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-15.jpg" alt="Me rolling the dough out flat with a rolling pin." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Finally, I can roll it out flat with a rolling pin.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-16.jpg" alt="Me cutting a strip off the flattened dough with a knife. Nearby, there is a rack with some other strips of dough sitting on it." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I cut the dough into strips to cook it. On the racks, the biscuit strips are exposed to the air on all sides, so they dry faster.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-17.jpg" alt="Two racks covered in biscuit strips, with some of the other kitchen stuff nearby." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>The final arrangement, ready to go in the oven.</p>

<img src="http://deqyc5bzdh53a.cloudfront.net/biscuits-130817-18.jpg" alt="The same rack of biscuits being put into an oven, using potholders." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>And it goes in.<footnote((Actually, it didn't quite fit this way, and we arrange the racks differently now, and I don't have a good photo of that. Not that it makes a difference to you, dear readers, unless you happen to own exactly the same racks and same oven.))></p>

<p>I set the oven to 250&deg;F (121&deg;C), and then I set a timer. Every 20 minutes, I open the oven door a little to let out the steam. I keep doing this until not much steam comes out. That happens after a few hours. (It doesn't always take the same amount of time, and I don't understand everything that affects that process.) After that, I turn off the oven, but leave the biscuits in the (still hot) oven overnight.</p>

<p>And then I get these great biscuits! In fact, I ate one while I was writing this post.</p>

<p>But my sibling, who took these photos for me, has problems with eating wheat products. So we've been trying to design an alternate recipe without wheat. The trouble is, the wheat is what's holding the biscuit together in biscuit shape. We tried replacing it with corn meal, oat flour, quinoa flour, rice flour, and buckwheat flour. None of them except the buckwheat flour held together at all. They disintegrated if you tried to pick them up. And replacing wheat with buckwheat still made a weaker biscuit, although at least it was strong enough to pick up.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, what made the toughest biscuit was combining a <em>little</em> buckwheat flour with a lot of quick oats. It seems like the oats give the biscuit some structural strength, while the buckwheat keeps it from just falling apart. I didn't record the exact quantities, though.</p>

<p>In the world of the game <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, people are grouped into nine "alignments". Each person is Good or Evil (or Neutral), and also Lawful or Chaotic (or Neutral). What do those mean? There are as many interpretations as there are D&D players. This post describes mine.</p>

<p>First, Law vs Chaos (officially called the "ethical axis"). The convention is that lawful people are honest, honorable, respect authority, and value order above freedom. But which honor, which authority, and which order? And why is "order" aligned with "authority", when obedience to corrupt authority figures often contradicts both moral principles and the letter of the law?</p>

<p>In my system, <span style="background-color: #ddddff">Law vs Chaos is the <strong>ideological axis</strong> of alignment. All actions promote some ideologies and weaken others, but a Lawful person is one who consciously intends to uphold or promote an ideology through zir actions, while a Chaotic person acts without caring which ideologies win out, or cares only as much as it advances zir personal goals.</span> A person who tells the truth because ze believes everyone should be honest is Lawful. A person who tells the truth because ze wants people to trust zem is Chaotic.</p>

<p>Good vs Evil (officially the "moral axis") is harder. How do you define good and evil? And even if you can lump people into "good" and "evil" categories, <em>should</em> you? The system implies that good and evil actions can be summed up, leading to things like "I saved a village from a fire, so now I can get away with kicking 2.85 puppies". And you see that reflected in real life - when a popular person abuses someone, zir fans often don't believe the victim, because the popular person is already "one of the good guys". Besides, the good/evil distinction wastes a lot of storytelling potential. If your story has a villain, can that villain be Good? It seems like a waste of a cool alignment system if half the characters usually can't be half the alignments.</p>

<p>My first thought was to twist it up a little, and construct a world where the unshakable judgments of "Good" and "Evil" were as inaccurate as they are in real life. I made "Good" mean "intends to help others" and "Evil" mean "doesn't care what happens to others as long as it benefits zem" &ndash; there would be plenty of "Evil-aligned" people who are good, helpful and productive (because trust and social support can be more valuable than what you can get by cheating), and plenty of "Good-aligned" people who are evil, willfully harming others (because they falsely believe it will help, and refuse to reconsider their position). But I wanted my alignment system to be more than just a criticism of the standard one.</p>

<p>Instead, I replaced the alignments.</p>

<p>Now, <span style="background-color: #ffdddd">my <strong>social axis</strong> of alignment is Meddling vs Detached. All actions may help or harm others, but a Meddling person is one who consciously intends to have specific effects on others, while a Detached person knows zir actions affect others but doesn't care how, or cares only as much as it advances zir personal goals.</span></p>

<h2>Some examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Helping someone because you want them to feel good is <strong>Chaotic Meddling</strong>.
<li>Wanting to establish a social order where everyone feels good constantly is <strong>Lawful Meddling</strong>.
<li>Helping someone because you'll get something in return is <strong>Chaotic Detached</strong>.
<li>Wanting everyone to use such a system of exchanging favors is <strong>Lawful Detached</strong>.
<li>Hurting a person because you hate them is <b>Chaotic Meddling</b>.
<li>Hurting a person because you think they morally deserve to suffer is <b>Lawful Meddling</b>.
<li>Hurting a person as punishment, purely to deter them for violating a rule, is <b>Lawful Detached</b>.
<li>Hurting a person to coerce them into helping you is <b>Chaotic Detached</b>.
</ul>

<p>It's conventional to think of goodness as being Lawful Meddling: a person has beliefs about what's good, and tries to impose those beliefs on the world. But no alignment is really better at being good than another. A Lawful person might fail by sticking to a particular ideology even when it has perverse consequences. A Meddling person might fail by being too attached to the <em>idea</em> of helping someone, even when the best way to help is to give them space. A Chaotic Detached person is sometimes the best one to give help, because Chaos and Detachment both mean not trying to impose zir own reality on a situation it doesn't fit. But a Chaotic person might fail because, without consistent principles, ze increases inequality by only helping the people right in front of zem. And a Detached person might fail by losing the motivation to help.</p>

<p>On each axis, you can also be <strong>Neutral</strong> or <strong>Nonaligned</strong>. A Neutral person is in between the ends of the spectrum &ndash; they somewhat value ideologies or interpersonal actions, but not always or not as strongly. A Nonaligned person doesn't fit on the axis at all: Ideologically nonaligned people don't understand that ideologies exist. Socially nonaligned people don't believe that the lives of others have any meaning &ndash; they believe people are no better off if you help them and no worse off if you hurt them (or, more extremely, they don't believe that other people exist). The character Ignus, from Planescape: Torment, is Lawful Nonaligned: ze is a fire wizard whose only desire is for literally everything to be set on fire. Since ze is oblivious to the reality of people around zem, ze never truly makes a choice about whether to affect others, and therefore is Nonaligned rather than Detached (since a Detached person is someone who knows, but doesn't care).</p>

<p>You could ask me, why is it a good idea to divide people into these categories at all?</p>

<p>I don't actually know. I just found it really interesting to think about the design of the system.</p>

<p>I currently think of myself as <strong>Lawful Neutral</strong>. I try to make the world better for everyone, which seems Meddling, but I only do that because I <em>believe it's the right thing to do</em> (a Lawful motivation) rather than because I have any innate desire to make people feel better.</p>

  "contents":'''

<p>In my story <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/main/posts/358-capitalism-sat">Capitalism Sat</a>, "Mathematics" says a few things about game theory that I've worked on myself. I'll discuss them here. Knowing some game theory helps, but you might be able to understand without any prior background.</p>

<p>The classic paradox from game theory is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>, or the more general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a> &ndash; a situation where players can either cooperate or betray each other, and benefit from betraying, but are better off if everyone cooperates instead of everyone betraying. There are a lot of attempts to "solve" the Prisoner's Dilemma &ndash; that is, to find a reason why purely self-interested players should cooperate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrational">Superrationality</a> is one of them, but it only works for a limited set of situations. A more effective solution to allow contracts.</p>

<h2>Contracts</h2>

<p>If there is an independent contract enforcer, then the players will cooperate. Purely self-interested players can't make contracts without an independent enforcer, because they will (by the definition of their self-interest) break the contracts. But a self-interested player can enter a contract if it will benefit them, and since the enforcer will penalize them if they break it, it's in their self-interest to keep the contract. Formally, just as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> is a set of choices where no <em>individual player</em> can gain by changing their choice, I define a <strong>contract equilibrium</strong> as a set of choices where no <em>group of players</em> can all gain by collectively changing their choices.<footnote((The idea of a contract equilibrium seems like such an obvious extension of game theory that I assume plenty of people have thought of it already, so there's probably already a phrase to describe it so that I don't have to invent my own. However, I couldn't find any writing about game theory that describes it.))> With a finite collection of choices, there is always at least one contract equilibrium.</p>

<p>The contract equilibria have desirable results for the Prisoner's Dilemma, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_game_(game_theory)">centipede game</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt">Stag hunt</a>, and a lot of other simple games. Contract equilibria have one desirable attribute: if I define <strong>strictly worse</strong> to mean "worse for every player", then they will never produce a result that's strictly worse than another possible result (because then all the players would form a contract to get the other result instead). Nash equilibria, on the other hand, can produce results that are strictly worse than contract equilibria.</p>

<p>"Strictly worse" isn't a very good way to judge, of course. What about a situation where one player benefits a little, but all other players are much worse off? To judge those situations, we need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_function">social welfare function</a> &ndash; in short, if you represent each person's happiness as a number, a social welfare function is a way to get a single number for the whole society<footnote((Technically, these "numbers" don't have to be numbers; they can be any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">totally ordered</a> set. And perhaps it's better if they are only an ordering; I find it much easier to say "I prefer X rather than Y" than to assign a number to how much I prefer it.))>. There are lots of different proposed social welfare functions, and I don't really want to say that one of them is better than the others. Here's a few examples:</p>
<ul><li><strong>minimum</strong>: "A society is only worth as much as it gives to its most disadvantaged member"</li><li><strong>sum</strong> or <strong>average</strong><footnote((Sum and average are equivalent if the number of people is fixed. I'm not considering variable numbers of people in this post; that leads to annoying questions like "If we use the average function, does killing unhappy people improve society?" and "If we use the sum function, does spawning 1000 unhappy babies who will soon die improve society?".))>: "Any person being 1 point happier is as good as any other"</li><li>a <strong>weighted average</strong> with the worse-off having more weight (a generalized compromise between the above positions)</li></ul>

Fortunately, I don't need to pick a specific function. I can prove counterintituive results with <em>any</em> social welfare function that obeys a few simple conditions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Impartiality</strong>: An arbitrary reordering of the people must produce the same result.</li><li><strong>Weak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto optimality</a></strong>: If every individual person is better off, society is better off.</li></ul>

<p>There are a lot of other reasonable conditions you could add, but as it turns out, this is all I need. Now I can demonstrate a game where the contract equilbrium is worse than the Nash equilibrium.</p>

<p><strong>The Two Exploiters scenario</strong>: There are five players. The first two are in a Prisoner's Dilemma situation; if they both cooperate, they both score 3, if they both betray, they both score 2, and if only one betrays, that player score 4 and the other scores 1. The rest of the players have no choices and they score equal to their player number. But the first two players' option is actually to cooperate in exploiting the rest, so if the first two cooperate, the rest score their player number minus three instead. In the Nash equilibrium, they betray each other, and the scores are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>2</li><li>2</li><li>3</li><li>4</li><li>5</li></ol>
In the contract equilibrium, they cooperate, and the scores are:</p>
<ol><li>3</li><li>3</li><li>0</li><li>1</li><li>2</li></ol>
By Impartiality, I can swap the conspirators to the end and get the same social welfare:</p>
<ol><li>0</li><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>3</li><li>3</li></ol>
<p>Each entry is lower than the corresponding one in the Nash equilbrium, so by weak Pareto optimality, the social welfare of the contract equilibrium is lower.</p>

<h2>The non-aggression principle</h2>

<p>Cooperating to exploit everyone doesn't sound nice. We can solve that with the other concept I mentioned in <i>Capitalism Sat</i>: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">"non-aggression principle"</a>, which says that regardless of your self-interest or contracts, you must not take certain actions &ndash; specifically, you must not initiate violence against others. If we ban the first two players from conspiring, everything is better again. Of course, it's not clear how these numbers correspond to real life; maybe players 1 and 2 work together to violently extort from everybody, which is clearly aggression, but maybe they're rival business owners conspiring to raise prices (which is illegal in at least the United States, but is hard to describe as initiating violence). Once again, I don't have to decide, because I can prove that <strong>no possible</strong> non-aggression principle leads to desirable results in all cases. The key weakness is that the principle is required to ban the same actions for every player; if two players have the same set of choices, it can't regulate their behavior differently.</p>

<p>I'll start with one that shows it without contracts (which is simpler). This scenario is a cross between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer%27s_dilemma">Volunteer's dilemma</a>, so I'll call it <strong>the Tragedy of the Volunteers scenario</strong>. There are 102 players, and each player chooses whether to "participate" or "ignore", and scores as follows: +1 if ze participated, +100 if any player participated, -1 for each other player who participated. (Imagine it's a task that benefits everyone and is fun to do, but gets messed up if too many people try to help at the same time.) Since each player benefits from participating, the Nash equilibrium has them all participating, scoring a total of zero. Adding a non-aggression principle cannot do anything except ban one of the options for all players... and forcing them all to chose "ignore" <em>also results in a score of zero for all players</em>. The best result is for exactly one player to participate and score 101 while everyone else scores 99. Contracts almost achieve this; they might end up with two people participating for two 100s and a hundred 98s, which I'd generally say is worse, but isn't necessarily worse by just Impartiality and weak Pareto optimality.</p>

<p>Now I'll break it with contracts, too. Just like in the Two Exploiters scenario, I have to make two different categories of players.<footnote((Proof sketch: If the players are identical, then Impartiality is irrelevant, and weak Pareto optimality is just the "strictly worse" condition.))> This one is based on a task that requires a skill and is good for all, but messes up if more than one person tries to do it at the same time.<footnote((There are lots of examples of such tasks in real life. For instance, organizing and leading a group of workers: lots of people like leading, and one person taking charge can make the work more organized, but it's less efficient if two people try to do it at the same time.))> There are 2 skilled players, who choose "participate" or "ignore" as above, and 2 unskilled players, who choose nothing<footnote((Alternatively, all the players have the same skills, but the first two enjoy doing the task and the second two don't enjoy it.))>. All players benefit on the basis of the work: if one skilled player participates but the other doesn't, everyone gets +3. The skilled players also enjoy participating and get +4 for participating; the unskilled players also have a base score of 2.</p>

<p>With <em>or</em> without contracts, the skilled players act in their own (individual or collective) self-interest by all participating, resulting in a payoff of 4 for themselves and nothing extra for everyone else, which gives the distribution [4,4,2,2]. This compares unfavorably to the distribution when exactly one participates: [7,3,5,5] (reordered, [7,5,5,3]). And the non-aggression principle can't change the Nash equilibrium except by banning participation, leading to the even worse [2,2,0,0].</p>

<p>None of these clever extra rules can avoid the basic fact that, if we are willing to harm others for our own self-interest, we will probably end up doing so. Instead, we should act for the benefit of both ourselves and others. We should learn to think in cooperative ways, rather than competitive ways, and teach others to do so as well. By giving up just one point, one of the skilled players earns three points for everyone else. There is a world where almost anyone would do that, and I believe we can reach that world.</p>

<h2>Rational altruism</h2>

<p>But wait!</p>

<p>I would be doing my own craft a disservice if I didn't turn its glare upon the idea of altruism as well. I define a <b>rational altruist</b> as a person who acts to maximize a specific social welfare function, just as the players in a Nash equilibrium act to maximize their own score. I will show that every counterintuitive behavior of game theory also occurs between rational altruists who use different social welfare functions!</p>

<p>A simple example, with two players. Player A uses the <strong>minimum</strong> function. Player B uses the <strong>average</strong> function. They can either do nothing, or take one of two actions: Action A improves the worst-off member by 1 point, but harms everyone else by 2 points. Action B harms the worst-off member by 2 points, but improves everyone else by 1 point. Player A takes action A to improve the minimum function by 1, and player B takes action B to improve the average function by (almost) 1. As a result, literally everyone in the society is worse off by one point, despite the fact that the actions were taken by purely rational altruists!</p>

<p>There's a few ways to convert an arbitrary game-theoretic game to a game between rational altruists. (The above example is a conversion of the Prisoner's Dilemma.) Unfortunately, the best ways to do it require a lot more math, so I won't show them here, and the simple ways use social welfare functions that aren't very realistic. The simplest way that I know is this: The altruist players use the functions "minimum", then "as good as the second-worst-off person", then "as good as the third-worst-off person", and so forth. We'll make the players of the original game correspond to those positions in the ordering: Their score after the altruists' decisions is the score from the original game, plus a large constant factor so that their scores don't change the ordering. (e.g. the first one is score+0, the second is score+1000, the third score+2000, and so forth, if no two scores possible in the original game differed by as much as 1000.)</p>

<p>And as if all the problems from game theory weren't bad enough, enforcing contracts between altruists is harder too. How many people would agree to intentionally harm society as a whole in order to penalize someone for breaking a contract?</p>

<h2>Oh crap, what do we do?</h2>

<p>I really have no idea!</p>

<p>But don't despair yet. There's some good news. First, although the ethics of "benefit yourself by harming others" are very <em>interesting</em> to talk about, I like to think of those situations as the rare ones. Most of our interactions rely on shared physical and social infrastructure, so an action that harms another person also harms yourself, and an action that helps another person also helps yourself. Obviously, stealing physical objects from total strangers is an exception, but if you steal from a friend, the theft will stress them out (or worse) and that stress will harm everyone in their social circle &ndash; and if you steal from someone in the same geographical area, it's likely that they were a friend of a friend. Abusers divide and damage their own communities, even if they don't understand how. Selfish motivations are aligned with each other more often than not.</p>

<p>Second, altruistic motivations are aligned even <em>more</em> often. Helping out the most disadvantaged members of society doesn't hurt the rest of society, it helps the rest of society. People who can't get medical treatment are more likely to spread diseases that can affect anyone. People are more productive if they have a social safety net than if they constantly have to worry about their physical safety, or where to get their next meal. And people who find that there's a community ready to help them, are more likely to want to help give back to that community once they have the ability to do so.</p>

<p>It is possible to make this world into a good world. It's just a matter of whether we will succeed.</p>

  "authors_notes":'''<p><a href="/blog/game-theory-contracts-altruism">Here's a post about one of the game theory things from the story.</a></p>''',
  "contents":'''<p>...in Plato's cave, watching the shadows. Outside, ze knew, there were people buying and selling. Capitalism saw them trading goods for goods, services for services. And oh, most beautiful of all, the exchange of goods for services, whereon the economy turns. What supplies! What demand! Capitalism blushed to think of it all.</p>

<p>And then zir chains were loosed. Ze turned, a breath half indrawn, barely daring to hope. Ze rushed out into the open air, eager to offer zir labor on the open market for a fair value.</p>

<p>Capitalism's name was Latisha Lopez. Capitalism didn't hear back from the first nine employers. Capitalism changed zir name to John Smith. Capitalism was hired as a professor of game theory. Capitalism was laid off so they could hire someone with a Ph.D. Capitalism tried a tutoring gig; people didn't like how ze dressed. Capitalism took off zir top hat and ribbons and tried again. Capitalism got a few jobs, but they didn't last long. Did they just pay me to take off my hat? ze asked zemself. Did they pay me to change my name? I wanted them to pay me to teach them...</p>

<p>Suddenly Capitalism saw it everywhere. It seemed no one was selling services. They sold whiteness, sold gender, sold fashion. They sold flattery and the image of success. They sold access to their personal lives. They sold evidence of lifelong conformism. An employer wanted to see Capitalism's facebook profile, but Capitalism didn't have one. So Capitalism went on the Internet and saw the ads. Capitalism knew there would be ads for goods and services. But the ads weren't selling goods or services. They sold false authority, sold romance, sold titillation. They sold smug half-truths and comfortable lies. They sold sexual violence and racial hatred and progressive ideals.</p>

<p>These people are so stupid! cried Capitalism in vain. They don't understand the truth about the exchange of value! But no one heard zem. Maybe only the common people are so wrong, ze thought. Surely if someone gets ahead in the world, they must be smart enough to understand. So Capitalism went to the stock market. Ze peeked in the mighty doors and watched in awe as the numbers flew past. Here they bought ignorance and sold promises, bought hopes and sold tragedy, bought politicians and sold souls. Capitalism strode up the golden hallway and demanded to see the greatest of all traders. The greatest of all traders was wheeled out. The greatest of all traders was a computer. Capitalism opened zir mouth, but before ze could speak one word, the computer had made $150 million buying vague knowledge and selling transient guesses. Capitalism hung zir head and slunk away in shame.</p>

<p>Capitalism didn't know who to trust. But Capitalism still had some hope left. Capitalism went and knocked on the door of Science. Why do people do such terrible things?! demanded Capitalism. Science told Capitalism to take a seat. Science told Capitalism about risk aversion. Science told Capitalism about unconscious racism. Science told Capitalism about cognitive dissonance. Science told Capitalism about the Milgram experiment. Just then the floor shook and a thunderous roar boomed out. Oh no, said Science. I left the door to the basement open. Science rushed to close the door, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Seven glowing eyes glared from the darkness and seven mandibles clicked loudly as the room filled with that destroyer of hopes, that deliverer of final answers, that child of formless gods whose names must never be spoken, Mathematics. Mathematics seized the two and pinned them to the ground. Mathematics turned its dreadful eyes on Capitalism and began to speak in a voice that grated the boundaries of zir sanity. Mathematics told Capitalism how enforcing contracts can decrease social welfare. Mathematics told Capitalism that markets aren't efficient unless P=NP. Mathematics told Capitalism that no uniformly applied non-aggression principle can prevent all game-theoretic situations where individual rational self-interest leads to a terrible result, with or without unlimited contract enforcement. Capitalism fainted dead away.</p>

<p>When Capitalism woke, Mathematics was nowhere in sight, so Capitalism tried to make a run for it. But Capitalism was in a police station. Mathematics was in the next cell over. The police had raided Science's house, and they were both being deported. Mathematics growled that you can't claim to be upholding a non-aggression principle based on your ownership of the land if the land was stolen from its traditional owners, but the police ignored Mathematics. The police put Capitalism on a bus and sent zem all the way back to Plato's cave where ze started. That didn't seem so bad. Capitalism never wanted to see Mathematics again.</p>

<p>But someone was waiting there in the cave. Who are you, asked Capitalism. The person said, I'm the one who broke your chains.</p>

<p>Capitalism stared in bewilderment. Why did you do that, said Capitalism. Did you hope to make a profit off my actions? Did you sell me out to the police? Did you bet money on my incomptence?</p>

<p>The person said, I did it because I believe everyone deserves a chance.</p>

<p>And Capitalism began to weep.</p>''',

<h2>What's important to me</h2>

<p>I am compelled to invent stories, and sometimes I write them as <a href="/stories">prose</a> or <a href="/comics">comics</a>. I enjoy figuring out how things work, then messing with them. I produce a lot of imagination, music, and philosophical thoughts. I like to design and play <a href="/games">games</a>. I use computers for most of the things I do.</p>
    
<p>The world can be a pretty awful place. My main <strong>objective</strong> is to make the world a good place. If the world becomes a good place, I win. If it stays awful until the end of all sentient life, I lose.</p>

<p>I'm somewhere on the autism spectrum, and my brain has a bunch of uncommon traits besides that. It's mostly awesome. I have a lot of mental abilities that most people don't.</p>
    
<h2>Other details</h2>

<p>A few of my mental traits can be disabling (e.g. oversensitivity to noise and other sensations), so I do consider myself a "person with a disability", but I don't think of my autism as a disability overall.</p>

<p>I'm agender. I've never felt female or male, not even a little bit. I prefer for people to refer to me by gender-neutral terms and <a href="fixme">pronouns</a>. People often assume I'm male, which annoys me, but it doesn't annoy me much more than any other time that people are wrong about something.</p>

<p>I grew up on the Internet. Physically, I grew up in a suburban town in the US Northeast. I was raised by parents who nurtured most of my interests. I went to high-quality public schools, where many of the adults (and some children) mistreated me for my autistic traits and gender expression.</p>

<p>I'm not religious. I'm middle-class. I'm white. I have no romantic or sexual attraction to people of any gender, but I do have sexual desires.</p>''',
