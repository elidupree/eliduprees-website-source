I was thinking of writing a post called "When is violence justified?", but then I decided to write this post instead.

Here's the ideal case: Joan is thinking of doing something violent. However, that violence is bad. You ask whether it's justified, and Joan realizes it's bad and decides not to do it.

But that's not the only thing that happens when you ask the question.

<ul class="big_list">
<li>If you ask in public, other people make their own decisions about whether Joan's violence is justified. This can be good, if they are well-informed and make the right decision. But it can also be bad. A lot of people will <a href="/blog/on-virtues">jump from "Joan made a bad choice" to "Joan is a bad person who deserves less help"</a>. They might even want to punish Joan, even though <a href="/blog/bad-actions-and-punishment">punishment is <em>also</em> violence and might <em>also</em> be unjustified</a>.<br><br>This is less of a worry if you ask Joan privately, rather than in public. But it's not totally gone, either. If Joan decides that the violence was unjustified, ze might mistreat <em>other</em> people who do similar violence in the future.</li>

<li>A lot of people have unhealthy moral beliefs about their <em>own</em> actions, too. Joan might feel excessively bad, or even punish zemself, if ze thinks ze's done something bad. This can be especially harmful if Joan decides the violence is bad but then does it anyway (which can happen for a lot of different reasons).</li>

<li>Maybe Joan makes the <em>wrong</em> decision. Maybe the violence was necessary to prevent a greater evil, but you talked zem out of it. Or maybe it was a bad idea, but talking about it made zem get attached to the idea of doing it. I'm not <em>too</em> worried about these cases, because it's generally easier to make the right decision if you talk about it than if you don't. But if neither of you has all the <em>facts</em>, it's not so good. If you ask for a justification too early, Joan will come up with one based on zir <em>current</em> knowledge. Then ze might think ze's found the right answer, and be less receptive to learning new facts that might change the answer.</li>

<li>By asking the question, you imply that Joan's violence is an important thing to worry about. Like any other statement, this implied one &ndash; "Joan's violence is an important concern" &ndash; can be correct, incorrect, or misleading.</li>
</ul>

Let me elaborate on that last one. If you talk about <cut>something in public<footnote((Including semi-public spaces like a club meeting or your Facebook friends list.))>, a lot of your audience won't know the facts of the situation at first. So they'll learn about it <em>from</em> what you say. If the first thing you talk about is Joan's violence, then the story they'll hear is "that situation where Joan was violent".

I mean, let's say Joan was <a href="http://nowfacenorth.com/2017/01/24/we-need-to-talk-about-how-we-talk-about-the-black-bloc/">a black bloc protester protecting people from police brutality</a>. And let's say Joan <em>did</em> also do at least one thing that was violent in a bad way, and you want to critique it. Now you have a choice. You can save your critique for later &ndash; for a smaller audience who knows the full context and has a way to act on it. Or you can share it immediately. But I guarantee that if you share it with your audience of 100,000, or 200, or even 20, there will be at least one person who did <em>not</em> know that the police were the ones who did most of the violence at that protest. And that person will now believe that <em>Joan</em> was the one who did most of the violence.

Maybe your critique is important! But is it important <em>enough?</em> Does your critique do enough good to <em>justify</em> misleading some people like this? Worse yet, are you sure that <em>you</em> know the facts of the situation? Or is there a chance that you have already been misled in the same way? Perhaps by people just as well-intentioned as you are?

When you question an act of violence, you're not just deciding whether that violence was good. You're also deciding which violence should get attention. And you're deciding which things will be called violence in the first place. And that issue &ndash; <em>which things will be called violence</em> &ndash; is just as important, but implicit. People call it violence if a schoolyard bully threatens to punch somebody. But what do they call it when the government forces children to go to school with bullies, by threatening them with much greater force? People call it violence if a protester breaks a window. What do they call it when a city modifies park benches so that homeless people can't sleep on them? What do they call arrests? What do they call prisons? I recently saw someone say, "violence is never acceptable unless there's an imminent danger to someone's life", while talking about an antifascist punching a fascist. But somehow, I've never seen someone say that in response to, say, a police officer arresting someone for shoplifting.

In this post, I'm not trying to convince you which of those forms of violence are justified. I just want to show you that it's your choice <em>which</em> violence to put up for critique. And that choice may help or harm people just as much as your conclusions do.

"title": "A slight change to my blog schedule, and an update on my projects",

"blurb": "No serious-business blog post today, but I'm in the process of writing a new story.",
"contents":'''
My "post something every Wednesday" schedule hasn't been working very well for me lately. I keep putting off writing a blog post into Wednesday, then feeling lethargic on Wednesday and not wanting to write one. Now, this isn't <em>entirely</em> a problem â€“ after all, it's gotten me to write some good posts, even if I didn't 100% enjoy the process. However, there's an extra issue:

A lot of the time, I've been working on some <em>other</em> project that I'll post here eventually, but it isn't ready to post by Wednesday. So when Wednesday rolls around, I <em>interrupt</em> myself from that project in order to write a blog post. My blog posts are Serious Business and take a lot of mental energy, so writing one really disrupts my flow on the other project.

So I feel like I need to change my schedule. The problem is, if I just <em>skip</em> Wednesdays when I need to, I'm worried that I'll <cut>skip a lot of them and lose my sense of Obligation To Produce Stuff. I'm intentionally maintaining that sense of obligation, because it generally makes me produce more stuff without being too much of a burden on me, so I don't want to lose it.

So my new rule is this: I still have to post something every Wednesday, but sometimes it can be just <em>a short status update about a project I'm currently working on</em>. To make sure the rule stays rigid, I can only do this if I actually use the Wednesday to work on a project.

In that spirit, here's what I'm working on currently:

I'm in the process of writing a new story, named <em>Ravelling Wrath</em>. I've written about 2500 words and drawn about 20% of a picture. When I have about 4000 words and 2 pictures, I'll be ready to publish the first chapter (out of 18 planned).

I've also been messing around with some computer music generation. Here are some of the coolest ditties it's produced so far. I didn't choose any of the pitches myself. (<a href="/media/randomly-generated-music-1.wav?rr">Randomly generated music 1</a>, <a href="/media/randomly-generated-music-2.wav?rr">randomly generated music 2</a>)

I'm almost finished writing the first chapter of <a href="/stories/ravelling-wrath-chapter-1">Ravelling Wrath</a>, and I've written part of the second chapter as well. With any luck, I'll be able to post Chapter 1 next week.

The illustrations are a bit of a problem. My hands aren't up to doing that much drawing yet. But since I don't know when they'll be ready, I don't want to stall posting the written part. I think I might post it with just sketches instead of the finished drawings. I can come back and replace them with the finished versions later, and in the meantime, it'll be better than nothing.

Also! My sibling and I have been making a silly game called Portaltron. It's like the classic arcade game Tron, but the paths you leave behind are rows of the portals from Portal. I don't have a good guess about if/when we'll finish it, though.

I've been making a lot of progress on <a href="/stories/ravelling-wrath-chapter-1">Ravelling Wrath</a>. The second chapter is now about 4500 words long. That's already 600 longer than the first chapter, and I'm not nearly done with it yet! I might even end up splitting it into two chapters. We'll see.

I haven't made progress on any other projects this week. My hands still aren't doing great. It's also been very dry, which makes my throat less comfortable, so I can't always dictate a lot. I've had a few ideas for blog posts, but I'm saving most of my throat usage for the story.

These are rules for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">the game of Go</a> that elegantly generalize the game to arbitrary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graphs</a>, made by <a href="http://www.idupree.com/">my sibling</a> and I. (This post probably won't be interesting unless you're Go player and/or a mathematician.)

Our ruleset uses stone scoring because it's super simple and clear what that means.  It uses divide-and-choose for komi because the first move is more valuable on some graphs than others.  It uses a novel divide-and-choose method to address (super)ko. An ordinary superko rule would be well-defined here too.

<h2>The rules</h2>

INTRO: Go is a class of infinite combinatorial games<footnote((Formally, an infinite combinatorial game can be defined like this: A "move" is a natural number. A "strategy" is a function from finite sequences of moves (the game history) to moves (the next move to play). When two strategies are matched up against each other, such that they take turns choosing the next move, they produce an infinite sequence of moves. A "game" is a function from infinite sequences of moves to a game result (who won). When you're defining an infinite combinatorial game, you usually don't specify exactly how the game's moves map to natural numbers, because that is tedious and unimportant. You only need to understand that the moves <em>can</em> be represented that way.))> between two players, one for each finite<footnote((These rules <em>can</em> be generalized to infinite graphs, but they would have to be more complicated, and I haven't thought of an infinite graph that actually makes an interesting game. Here are some of the interesting cases: <ul> <li>An infinite normal board. Each player plays more live stones forever.</li> <li>Infinitely many disconnected rows of 3 points, which start with white stones at the ends and empty points in the middle. Here, White has infinite stones on every turn, but Black captures all of them.</li> <li>A normal board, plus infinitely many additional points that only have an arc to the bottom left corner of the normal board. This is equivalent to a normal game, except that owning that corner is worth infinite points. What's more, there can be a <em>ko</em> for ownership of that corner, which would be a ko with infinite value.</li> <li>Uncountable graphs would require an expanded definition of infinite combinatorial games.</li> </ul>))> directed graph and <cut>starting state.  Points have three possible states: empty, filled with a black stone, and filled with a white stone.  (Most common is a 19x19 grid with each point having arcs to the orthogonally adjacent points, in which all points begin empty.) Each player has an rational-number score that begins at 0. There is also a set of previous board states, the "history".

KOMI:  The first player chooses a rational number Komi. The second player chooses to be "White" or "Black".  The first player becomes the other color. White gains Komi score.

TURNS: Black and White take turns, with Black going first. Before each turn, the current position is added to the history. Then either player may delete the entire history. On your turn, you either place a stone of your color on an empty point, or pass.

CAPTURING: A stone's "liberties" are the empty points reachable from it by a path whose internal points are stones of its color. After you place a stone, all opposite-color stones with no liberties are simultaneously removed, then all same-color stones with no liberties are simultaneously removed.

KO: After you place a stone, you may make a ko bid. In a ko bid, you choose a nonnegative rational amount of score. Your opponent may ignore it, or they may choose a "ko winner". If they do: The ko winner may reset the board state to any state in the history. The ko loser gains the amount of score you chose. Then it becomes the ko winner's turn.

WINNING: The following actions are "unsustainable", in increasing order of unsustainability: making a ko bid, choosing yourself to be a ko winner, ignoring a ko bid, deleting the history. A player's "unsustainability" is the most unsustainable action that they did infinitely many times. If either player did infinitely many unsustainable actions, the player with lower unsustainability wins. Otherwise, the scores are eventually constant, and the winner is determined by score and stones, as follows: a player's "live stones" are the points that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventually_(mathematics)">eventually</a> always contain a stone of that player's color. Each player adds their eventual score to their number of live stones, to get a final score. If one player has a higher final score than the other, that player wins. If neither player wins, it's a draw.

<h2>Notes</h2>

Although this game theoretically has infinite moves, it is practical to play in real life. Typically, both players would end the game by saying "I pass forever if you do", and then it's understood that infinite passes have taken place.

The ko rule is quite fun. When you get in a loop (of any length), you delete the history, then the next time around the loop, you make a ko bid. That way, the ko winner can take an extra move from whichever point in the loop they prefer, but not from before the loop. Literally speaking, you can bid on <em>any</em> move, even if there isn't a ko. But with good players, if there's no actual infinite loop, there's no reason to make a ko bid, and no reason not to ignore one.

The "unsustainability" rule forces people to eventually answer ko bids instead of ignoring them forever. It includes "choosing yourself to be a ko winner" to deal with endgame kos that only one player can win. That player should be able to bid 0 instead of having to arbitrarily choose a small amount. This rule prevents the other player from just winning for 0 forever. In the case of complex loops, the unsustainability rule forces the players to offer bids that include the whole loop, rather than repeatedly deleting the history so that their opponent can only reset to points in the loop that are more favorable to themself.

The history deletion rule gives the game a cute property: two perfect players could theoretically sit down at a board and continue the game with perfect play, without knowing any of the history of that game.

I have a bunch of mathematical conjectures about this ruleset, but I haven't proved any of them. Proving things about infinite combinatorial games can be pretty hard.

<strong>"Perfect play" conjecture</strong>: For all graphs, with all starting states, there is a win-or-draw strategy for both players.

I will call a strategy "reasonable" if it is never unsustainable unless the opponent is more unsustainable. The idea is that of two reasonable strategies play against each other, the result should be sustainable.

<strong>"The ko rules basically work" conjecture</strong>: We may also require that such strategies are reasonable.

<strong>Score-independence conjecture</strong>: We may also require that such strategies' choices of move are independent of the current scores.

<strong>"Going first is good" conjecture</strong>: All graphs that start with an empty board have a win-or-draw strategy that chooses a nonnegative Komi.

<strong>"Perfect Komi" conjecture</strong>: On any graph, all win-or-draw strategies choose the same Komi.

<strong>"Score-independent strategies are score-maximizing" conjecture</strong>: On any graph, any reasonable, score-independent, win-or-draw strategy is also a <em>score-maximizing</em> strategy. That is, if the opponent is not unsustainable, it guarantees at least the maximum relative score that can be guaranteed by any strategy. This is technically a trivial corollary because any reasonable win-or-draw strategy guarantees at least 0 relative score, and 0 is always the maximum relative score that can be guaranteed in a game where the opponent also has a win-or-draw strategy. However, I claim that reasonable, score-independent, win-or-draw strategies <em>also</em> maximize their guaranteed relative score after any given incorrect play by the opponent, at which point it is possible to guarantee a relative score higher than 0.

<h3>Unstable components</h3>

Consider an isolated pair of points that are only connected to each other. Without a superko rule, the players can keep playing back and forth in this space.

Now, suppose there are N such pairs. With superko, the game can be completed, but it takes Î©(2<sup>N</sup>) moves to do so. Intuitively, it seems like games should be possible to complete in O(N) moves, where N is the number of points on the board. This is one of the reasons I didn't want to use a superko rule. (Our rules allow infinite loops, but at least the loop can begin within O(N) moves.)

In our rules, these pairs are always worth 0. That seems much more elegant to me. Neither player has an incentive to play in one. If either player does, the other player can just capture back indefinitely. So after all real points are decided, the game would end with them capturing back and forth forever, meaning that neither point becomes a <em>live stone</em>.<footnote((In an older version of our rules, <em>placing stones</em> was also an unsustainable action. With that variant, components like these cause a sort of <em>score leeway</em>. Suppose three of them exist, and one player is ahead by 10 points elsewhere on the board. Then that player can stop placing stones and allow the opponent to place stones in the three unstable components, but still win. But if the player is only 2 points up, the game will be a draw. Thus, there's a leeway of three points, meaning that you have to be more than three points ahead elsewhere to win. To me, score leeway still seems more elegant than the score being decided by superko behavior. However, it does also mean that perfect play isn't score-independent.))>

<strong>Stability conjecture</strong>: Each graph is "stable" or "unstable", independent of what stones start out in it. In an unstable graph, both players have a strategy that always wins if the opponent eventually passes. In a stable graph, both players have a win-or-draw strategy that always eventually passes. (Of all my conjectures, this is the one I'm least confident about. I haven't <em>thought</em> of any way the stability can be dependent on the stones, but Go does have <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?WmssDameSekiChallenge">some very weird corner cases</a> even on a normal board.)

<strong>"A normal board is stable" conjecture</strong>: The 19x19 grid is a stable graph.

<strong>"Independence of disconnected settled boards" conjecture</strong>: If two win-or-draw strategies that always eventually pass play against each other on a stable graph, we call the resulting position a "settled board". For any of the above conjectures, we can also require that the strategies' choices of move, other than deciding Komi, are independent of any combination of settled boards being added to the initial state as disconnected components, as long as their opponent doesn't play inside any of the settled boards. (Note that this is <em>not</em> true with a superko rule, because settled boards may contain unremovable ko threats.) Also, we can require that their choices of Komi should only differ by exactly the relative total numbers of stones on the added settled boards.
