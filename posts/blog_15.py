I was thinking of writing a post called "When is violence justified?", but then I decided to write this post instead.

Here's the ideal case: Joan is thinking of doing something violent. However, that violence is bad. You ask whether it's justified, and Joan realizes it's bad and decides not to do it.

But that's not the only thing that happens when you ask the question.

<ul class="big_list">
<li>If you ask in public, other people make their own decisions about whether Joan's violence is justified. This can be good, if they are well-informed and make the right decision. But it can also be bad. A lot of people will <a href="/blog/on-virtues">jump from "Joan made a bad choice" to "Joan is a bad person who deserves less help"</a>. They might even want to punish Joan, even though <a href="/blog/bad-actions-and-punishment">punishment is <em>also</em> violence and might <em>also</em> be unjustified</a>.<br><br>This is less of a worry if you ask Joan privately, rather than in public. But it's not totally gone, either. If Joan decides that the violence was unjustified, ze might mistreat <em>other</em> people who do similar violence in the future.</li>

<li>A lot of people have unhealthy moral beliefs about their <em>own</em> actions, too. Joan might feel excessively bad, or even punish zemself, if ze thinks ze's done something bad. This can be especially harmful if Joan decides the violence is bad but then does it anyway (which can happen for a lot of different reasons).</li>

<li>Maybe Joan makes the <em>wrong</em> decision. Maybe the violence was necessary to prevent a greater evil, but you talked zem out of it. Or maybe it was a bad idea, but talking about it made zem get attached to the idea of doing it. I'm not <em>too</em> worried about these cases, because it's generally easier to make the right decision if you talk about it than if you don't. But if neither of you has all the <em>facts</em>, it's not so good. If you ask for a justification too early, Joan will come up with one based on zir <em>current</em> knowledge. Then ze might think ze's found the right answer, and be less receptive to learning new facts that might change the answer.</li>

<li>By asking the question, you imply that Joan's violence is an important thing to worry about. Like any other statement, this implied one &ndash; "Joan's violence is an important concern" &ndash; can be correct, incorrect, or misleading.</li>
</ul>

Let me elaborate on that last one. If you talk about <cut>something in public<footnote((Including semi-public spaces like a club meeting or your Facebook friends list.))>, a lot of your audience won't know the facts of the situation at first. So they'll learn about it <em>from</em> what you say. If the first thing you talk about is Joan's violence, then the story they'll hear is "that situation where Joan was violent".

I mean, let's say Joan was <a href="http://nowfacenorth.com/2017/01/24/we-need-to-talk-about-how-we-talk-about-the-black-bloc/">a black bloc protester protecting people from police brutality</a>. And let's say Joan <em>did</em> also do at least one thing that was violent in a bad way, and you want to critique it. Now you have a choice. You can save your critique for later &ndash; for a smaller audience who knows the full context and has a way to act on it. Or you can share it immediately. But I guarantee that if you share it with your audience of 100,000, or 200, or even 20, there will be at least one person who did <em>not</em> know that the police were the ones who did most of the violence at that protest. And that person will now believe that <em>Joan</em> was the one who did most of the violence.

Maybe your critique is important! But is it important <em>enough?</em> Does your critique do enough good to <em>justify</em> misleading some people like this? Worse yet, are you sure that <em>you</em> know the facts of the situation? Or is there a chance that you have already been misled in the same way? Perhaps by people just as well-intentioned as you are?

When you question an act of violence, you're not just deciding whether that violence was good. You're also deciding which violence should get attention. And you're deciding which things will be called violence in the first place. And that issue &ndash; <em>which things will be called violence</em> &ndash; is just as important, but implicit. People call it violence if a schoolyard bully threatens to punch somebody. But what do they call it when the government forces children to go to school with bullies, by threatening them with much greater force? People call it violence if a protester breaks a window. What do they call it when a city modifies park benches so that homeless people can't sleep on them? What do they call arrests? What do they call prisons? I recently saw someone say, "violence is never acceptable unless there's an imminent danger to someone's life", while talking about an antifascist punching a fascist. But somehow, I've never seen someone say that in response to, say, a police officer arresting someone for shoplifting.

In this post, I'm not trying to convince you which of those forms of violence are justified. I just want to show you that it's your choice <em>which</em> violence to put up for critique. And that choice may help or harm people just as much as your conclusions do.

"title": "A slight change to my blog schedule, and an update on my projects",

"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "No serious-business blog post today, but I'm in the process of writing a new story.",
"contents":'''
My "post something every Wednesday" schedule hasn't been working very well for me lately. I keep putting off writing a blog post into Wednesday, then feeling lethargic on Wednesday and not wanting to write one. Now, this isn't <em>entirely</em> a problem – after all, it's gotten me to write some good posts, even if I didn't 100% enjoy the process. However, there's an extra issue:

A lot of the time, I've been working on some <em>other</em> project that I'll post here eventually, but it isn't ready to post by Wednesday. So when Wednesday rolls around, I <em>interrupt</em> myself from that project in order to write a blog post. My blog posts are Serious Business and take a lot of mental energy, so writing one really disrupts my flow on the other project.

So I feel like I need to change my schedule. The problem is, if I just <em>skip</em> Wednesdays when I need to, I'm worried that I'll <cut>skip a lot of them and lose my sense of Obligation To Produce Stuff. I'm intentionally maintaining that sense of obligation, because it generally makes me produce more stuff without being too much of a burden on me, so I don't want to lose it.

So my new rule is this: I still have to post something every Wednesday, but sometimes it can be just <em>a short status update about a project I'm currently working on</em>. To make sure the rule stays rigid, I can only do this if I actually use the Wednesday to work on a project.

In that spirit, here's what I'm working on currently:

I'm in the process of writing a new story, named <em>Ravelling Wrath</em>. I've written about 2500 words and drawn about 20% of a picture. When I have about 4000 words and 2 pictures, I'll be ready to publish the first chapter (out of 18 planned).

I've also been messing around with some computer music generation. Here are some of the coolest ditties it's produced so far. I didn't choose any of the pitches myself. (<a href="/media/randomly-generated-music-1.wav?rr">Randomly generated music 1</a>, <a href="/media/randomly-generated-music-2.wav?rr">randomly generated music 2</a>)

I'm almost finished writing the first chapter of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a>, and I've written part of the second chapter as well. With any luck, I'll be able to post Chapter 1 next week.

The illustrations are a bit of a problem. My hands aren't up to doing that much drawing yet. But since I don't know when they'll be ready, I don't want to stall posting the written part. I think I might post it with just sketches instead of the finished drawings. I can come back and replace them with the finished versions later, and in the meantime, it'll be better than nothing.

Also! My sibling and I have been making a silly game called Portaltron. It's like the classic arcade game Tron, but the paths you leave behind are rows of the portals from Portal. I don't have a good guess about if/when we'll finish it, though.

I've been making a lot of progress on <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a>. The second chapter is now about 4500 words long. That's already 600 longer than the first chapter, and I'm not nearly done with it yet! I might even end up splitting it into two chapters. We'll see.

I haven't made progress on any other projects this week. My hands still aren't doing great. It's also been very dry, which makes my throat less comfortable, so I can't always dictate a lot. I've had a few ideas for blog posts, but I'm saving most of my throat usage for the story.

"blurb": "These are rules for the game of Go that elegantly generalize the game to arbitrary directed graphs, made by my sibling and I. (This post probably won't be interesting unless you're Go player and/or a mathematician.)",
"contents":'''

These are rules for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">the game of Go</a> that elegantly generalize the game to arbitrary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graphs</a>, made by <a href="http://www.idupree.com/">my sibling</a> and I. (This post probably won't be interesting unless you're Go player and/or a mathematician.)

Our ruleset uses stone scoring because it's super simple and clear what that means.  It uses divide-and-choose for komi because the first move is more valuable on some graphs than others.  It uses a novel divide-and-choose method to address (super)ko. An ordinary <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?Superko">superko</a> rule would be well-defined here too.

<h2>The rules</h2>

INTRO: Go is a class of infinite combinatorial games<footnote((Formally, an infinite combinatorial game can be defined like this: A "move" is a natural number. A "strategy" is a function from finite sequences of moves (the game history) to moves (the next move to play). When two strategies are matched up against each other, such that they take turns choosing the next move, they produce an infinite sequence of moves. A "game" is a function from infinite sequences of moves to a game result (who won). When you're defining an infinite combinatorial game, you usually don't specify exactly how the game's moves map to natural numbers, because that is tedious and unimportant. You only need to understand that the moves <em>can</em> be represented that way.))> between two players, one for each finite<footnote((These rules <em>can</em> be generalized to infinite graphs, but they would have to be more complicated, and I haven't thought of an infinite graph that actually makes an interesting game. Here are some of the interesting cases: <ul> <li>An infinite normal board. Each player plays more live stones forever.</li> <li>Infinitely many disconnected rows of 3 points, which start with white stones at the ends and empty points in the middle. Here, White has infinite stones on every turn, but Black captures all of them.</li> <li>A normal board, plus infinitely many additional points that only have an arc to the bottom left corner of the normal board. This is equivalent to a normal game, except that owning that corner is worth infinite points. What's more, there can be a <em>ko</em> for ownership of that corner, which would be a ko with infinite value.</li> <li>Uncountable graphs would require an expanded definition of infinite combinatorial games.</li> </ul>))> directed graph and <cut>starting state.  Points have three possible states: empty, filled with a black stone, and filled with a white stone.  (Most common is a 19x19 grid with each point having arcs to the orthogonally adjacent points, in which all points begin empty.) Each player has a rational-number score that begins at 0. There is also a set of previous board states, the "history".

KOMI:  The first player chooses a rational number, Komi. The second player chooses to be "White" or "Black".  The first player becomes the other color. White gains Komi score.

TURNS: Black and White take turns, with Black going first. Before each turn, the current position is added to the history. Then either player may delete the entire history. On your turn, you either place a stone of your color on an empty point, or pass.

CAPTURING: A stone's "liberties" are the empty points reachable from it by a path whose internal points are stones of its color. After you place a stone, all opposite-color stones with no liberties are simultaneously removed, then all same-color stones with no liberties are simultaneously removed.

KO: After you place a stone, you may make a ko bid. In a ko bid, you choose a nonnegative rational amount of score. Your opponent may ignore it, or they may choose either player to be the "ko winner". If they do: The ko winner may reset the board state to any state in the history. The ko loser gains the amount of score you chose. Then it becomes the ko winner's turn.

WINNING: The following actions are "unsustainable", in increasing order of unsustainability: making a ko bid, choosing yourself to be a ko winner, ignoring a ko bid, deleting the history. A player's "unsustainability" is the most unsustainable action that they did infinitely many times. If either player did infinitely many unsustainable actions, the player with lower unsustainability wins. Otherwise, the scores are eventually constant, and the winner is determined by score and stones, as follows: a player's "live stones" are the points that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventually_(mathematics)">eventually</a> always contain a stone of that player's color. Each player adds their eventual score to their number of live stones, to get a final score. If one player has a higher final score than the other, that player wins. If neither player wins, it's a draw.

<h2>Notes</h2>

Although this game theoretically has infinite moves, it is practical to play in real life. Typically, both players would end the game by saying "I pass forever if you do", and then it's understood that infinite passes have taken place.

The ko rule is quite fun. When you get in a loop (of any length), you delete the history, then the next time around the loop, you make a ko bid. That way, the ko winner can take an extra move from whichever point in the loop they prefer, but not from before the loop. Literally speaking, you can bid on <em>any</em> move, even if there isn't a ko. But with good players, if there's no actual infinite loop, there's no reason to make a ko bid, and no reason not to ignore one.

The "unsustainability" rule forces people to eventually answer ko bids instead of ignoring them forever. It includes "choosing yourself to be a ko winner" to deal with endgame kos that only one player can win. That player should be able to bid 0 instead of having to arbitrarily choose a small amount. This rule prevents the other player from just winning for 0 forever. In the case of complex loops, the unsustainability rule forces the players to offer bids that include the whole loop, rather than repeatedly deleting the history so that their opponent can only reset to points in the loop that are more favorable to themself.

The history deletion rule gives the game a cute property: two perfect players could theoretically sit down at a board and continue the game with perfect play, without knowing any of the history of that game. (They'd only need to know whose turn it was.)

I have a bunch of mathematical conjectures about this ruleset, but I haven't proved any of them. Proving things about infinite combinatorial games can be pretty hard.

<strong>"Perfect play" conjecture</strong>: For all graphs, with all starting states, there is a win-or-draw strategy for both players.

I will call a strategy "reasonable" if it is never unsustainable unless the opponent is more unsustainable. The idea is that if two reasonable strategies play against each other, the result should be sustainable.

<strong>"The ko rules basically work" conjecture</strong>: We may also require that such strategies are reasonable.

<strong>Score-independence conjecture</strong>: We may also require that such strategies' choices of move are independent of the current scores.

<strong>"Going first is good" conjecture</strong>: All graphs that start with an empty board have a win-or-draw strategy that chooses a nonnegative Komi.

<strong>"Perfect Komi" conjecture</strong>: On any graph, all win-or-draw strategies choose the same Komi.

<strong>"Score-independent strategies are score-maximizing" conjecture</strong>: On any graph, any reasonable, score-independent, win-or-draw strategy is also a <em>score-maximizing</em> strategy. That is, if the opponent is not unsustainable, it guarantees at least the maximum relative score that can be guaranteed by any strategy. This is technically a trivial corollary because any reasonable win-or-draw strategy guarantees at least 0 relative score, and 0 is always the maximum relative score that can be guaranteed in a game where the opponent also has a win-or-draw strategy. However, I claim that reasonable, score-independent, win-or-draw strategies <em>also</em> maximize their guaranteed relative score after any given incorrect play by the opponent, at which point it is possible to guarantee a relative score higher than 0.

<h3>Unstable components</h3>

Consider an isolated pair of points that are only connected to each other. Without a superko rule, the players can keep playing back and forth in this space.

Now, suppose there are N such pairs. With superko, the game can be completed, but it takes Ω(2<sup>N</sup>) moves to do so. Intuitively, it seems like games should be possible to complete in O(N) moves, where N is the number of points on the board. This is one of the reasons I didn't want to use a superko rule. (Our rules allow infinite loops, but at least the loop can begin within O(N) moves.)

In our rules, these pairs are always worth 0. That seems much more elegant to me. Neither player has an incentive to play in one. If either player does, the other player can just capture back indefinitely. So after all real points are decided, the game would end with them capturing back and forth forever, meaning that neither point becomes a <em>live stone</em>.<footnote((In an older version of our rules, <em>placing stones</em> was also an unsustainable action. With that variant, isolated pairs cause a sort of <em>score leeway</em>. Suppose three of them exist, and one player is ahead by 10 points elsewhere on the board. Then that player can still win even if they stop placing stones and allow the opponent to place stones in the three unstable components. But if the player is only 2 points up, the game will be a draw. Thus, there's a leeway of three points, meaning that you have to be more than three points ahead elsewhere to win. To me, score leeway still seems more elegant than the score being decided by superko behavior. However, it does also mean that perfect play isn't score-independent.))>

<strong>Stability conjecture</strong>: Each graph is "stable" or "unstable", independent of what stones start out in it. In an unstable graph, both players have a strategy that always wins if the opponent eventually passes. In a stable graph, both players have a win-or-draw strategy that always eventually passes. (Of all my conjectures, this is the one I'm least confident about. I haven't <em>thought</em> of any way the stability can be dependent on the stones, but Go does have <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?WmssDameSekiChallenge">some very weird corner cases</a> even on a normal board.)

<strong>"A normal board is stable" conjecture</strong>: The 19x19 grid is a stable graph.

<strong>"Independence of disconnected settled boards" conjecture</strong>: If two win-or-draw strategies that always eventually pass play against each other on a stable graph, we call the resulting position a "settled board". For any of the above conjectures, we can also require that the strategies' choices of move, other than deciding Komi, are independent of any combination of settled boards being added to the initial state as disconnected components, as long as their opponent doesn't play inside any of the settled boards. (Note that this is <em>not</em> true with a superko rule, because settled boards may contain <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?UnremovableKoThreat">unremovable ko threats</a>.) Also, we can require that their choices of Komi should only differ by exactly the relative total numbers of stones on the added settled boards.

The second chapter of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a> now stands at <em>7100</em> words, almost twice as long as the first one. I'll probably split it in two. However, because I've been writing it out-of-order, the first half isn't finished yet either. And once I finish it, I will still have to do some website work. (Right now, I don't have a real system for stories with multiple chapters.) I could theoretically have a chapter ready by next week, but my best guess is more like two or three weeks.

My other projects are still stalled. The current phase in the Saga Of Eli Dupree's Hand Problems is expected to take another month or so. They are currently at a point where they sometimes feel good enough to do a bunch of computer work, but I have to stop myself because they're not <em>actually</em> ready for that much.

"contents":'''

I grew up reading the Harry Potter books. They were real page-turners – I was always eager to keep reading. In particular, many chapters ended in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger">cliffhangers</a>.

I took a lot of creative writing classes, but none of them taught me how to write a book like that. They taught me a lot of theories about Conflict and Symbolism and Scene Structure. But none of them taught me a theory of how to write a page-turner. So I was forced to invent my own.

<p><a href="/blog/in-which-i-rant-about-the-study-of-english">Like any theory of "good writing", this theory isn't objectively true</a> – it won't work on all readers. But <a href="/blog/why-should-knowledge-be-correct-anyway">I'm going to say it as if it's true, because it's been useful to me.</a> Also, I refer to fiction writing in this post, but this theory applies to any form of narrative, including movies, comics, news articles, etc..</p>
 
<h2>Promise theory</h2>

A classic cliffhanger is a type of <strong>promise</strong>. It says, "Just turn the page, and I'll tell you what happens next!"

Promises are what makes the reader what to keep reading. But there are lots of different kinds of promises. Some are <cut>big and long-term: A mystery novel promises, "finish the book and I'll tell you how the murder happened!" But others are small and short-term: When a character asks a question, that promises, "read the next line and I'll tell you how the other person answers!" Every medium has its own variations. A news headline promises, "read the article and I'll tell you about this thing that happened!"

The central advice of promise theory is that <strong>you want to maintain a good variety of open promises at all times</strong>. By the time you fulfill each promise, you should make a new one to replace it. That way, the reader always has a lot of reasons to keep reading. You want both physical promises and emotional promises. You want both hopeful promises and scary promises. And you want both short-term promises and long-term promises. Ideally, the reader will have a sense of what's going to happen on the next <em>line</em>, and also what's going to happen in the next <em>paragraph</em>, and what's going to happen on the next <em>page</em>, and what's going to happen by the end of the <em>chapter</em>, and what's going to happen by the end of the <em>book</em>.

Only at the very end of the story, you can fulfill all of your remaining promises in a row.

Why such a variety? Because there's a lot of ways promises can fail.

<ul class="big_list">
<li>Sometimes the reader just isn't interested. "Okay, so I'm going to see how Harry wrestles with zir feelings. But I don't relate to Harry's feelings anyway, so I don't care."</li>
<li>Sometimes the reader forgot a promise. Maybe it wasn't mentioned for a while, or maybe they took a break from reading and didn't remember when they got back.</li>
<li>Sometimes the reader didn't believe a promise because you've broken too many promises in the past. "Okay, so Su-jin just walked into a death trap at the end of a chapter, and I want to see how ze'll manage to escape. But this book always switches to a different scene in the next chapter, so what's the point?"</li>
<li>Note that you don't have to deliberately break a promise for that to happen. The reader might just interpret one differently than you intended it. "I thought they were going to explore the cave right away, but they've spent two chapters just talking. Now I don't really expect that they'll explore the cave anytime soon."</li>
<li>Sometimes the reader didn't notice a promise because they don't know the genre conventions. "Okay, so the heroes of this horror story heard a clunking noise behind them – so what? That could be anything."</li>
</ul>

When you have a good variety of promises, they probably won't fail <em>all at once</em>. If the reader doesn't care about the stuff that happens on <em>this</em> page, but you promised that something really cool will happen on the <em>next</em> page, the reader will still stay engaged in the story. If your strongest promise fails for a particular reader, there should be a few more promises that are almost as strong to back it up.

<h3>Promise weight</h3>

What does it mean for a promise to be "strong"?

When I say "strength", I mean how strongly the promise makes the reader want to keep reading. This is affected by two things: <strong>promptness</strong> and <strong>weight</strong>. Promptness is <em>how soon</em> the reader expects the promise to be fulfilled. Weight is <em>how much importance</em> the story has given to the promise. Strength is promptness multiplied by weight.

I call it "weight" because it's built up over time. The weightiest promises are usually about a character who has been developed over many chapters. Even things that are important in <em>real life</em>, like "find out if Aaliyah lives or dies!", only have much <em>weight</em> if the story has spent a lot of time with Aaliyah already. (Although they do have <em>some</em> weight.)

Have you ever noticed how a lot of stories start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res">in the middle of an action scene</a>? That's because action scenes, like big fights, are automatically high-stakes. It's one of the few ways to excite a reader who hasn't gotten to know the characters yet. Action scenes have lot of short-term promises, with the highest weight they can manage. That keeps the reader going long enough for the story to start building up its own weight, to use on subtler promises in the future.

Once the story has gotten going, it's best to stack as much weight as you can on every promise. Sometimes this is harder than others, like when you're introducing a totally new character. But there's usually a way to make it important to a plot or character that's already established.

For instance, let's say a story wants to introduce the main character's sibling. The story starts a long paragraph with, "My sister was totally disorganized. She was always […]". That's a <em>promise</em> to tell me a paragraph full of facts about the sibling. I'm not interested in that promise, because it doesn't have much weight. But if the main character <em>first</em> starts worrying about whether the sibling will be able to keep an important secret, then the promised facts become much more interesting.

Like promises, not all types of weight will work for all readers. Some readers will care more about The Fate Of The World, others will care more about how their beloved characters feel about it. If a promise is related to <em>both</em> of those things, it's more likely to work for all readers.

A cliffhanger is effective because it has both kinds of strength. It has high promptness – the reader expects the story to start fulfilling it as soon as they start the next chapter. And it also has high weight – the fate of the story hangs in the balance!

<h3>Is this respectful to the reader?</h3>

Under promise theory, you might deliberately hide information that the reader wants, just to keep them reading. "I promise that I'll tell you what happens to the village… in the next chapter. I could tell you now, but I won't!" This can be kind of mean.

However, promise theory isn't inherently mean. It's just a matter of how you apply it. Readers are happier when they have a general sense of what's coming. And the reader will always make <em>some</em> sort of guesses about what's coming. So in a sense, <em>all</em> stories have implied promises – it's just that some of those promises are more accurate than others.

Promises aren't just information, either. They also create a structure in the story. When you get to a scene that fulfills a promise, it automatically has an extra meaning, because it's related to the scene(s) that established the promise.

The classic frustrating case is when a story promises to get to something eventually, but then drags on and on without getting to it. These stories rely on the big promise to keep the reader reading something they don't enjoy. This is <em>not</em> a very good use of promise theory. Under promise theory, there should also be short-term promises to keep the reader interested from moment to moment. <strong>Short-term promises are the backbone of enjoyable writing.</strong> Weighty long-term promises are a good thing to <em>include</em> – they can help keep the reader going if a few of your short-term promises didn't work for that particular reader. But they can't carry a story by themselves. (Also, the frustrating stories may have actually broken their promises by implying that they'd be fulfilled more promptly than they actually were.)

Cliffhangers in particular are a little questionable. Some readers want chapter boundaries to be good places to take a break from reading. If you put a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter, you're deliberately making it a harder place to stop, which is mean to those readers. However, other readers <em>enjoy</em> a story that has constant excitement and no good place to stop. So cliffhangers aren't inherently good or bad, they're just a choice about the style you want your story to have.

<h3>What about plot twists?</h3>

Let's say a fantasy story promises that the heroes will confront the Dark Lord and save the world. But when they get to the Dark Castle, they find that the Dark Lord has been dead for 50 years and zir minions are covering it up! Did the story break its promise?

I don't think of this as <em>breaking</em> a promise, just <em>fulfilling a promise in an unexpected way</em>. If you really analyze the implied promise, it's usually not "the heroes will definitely defeat the Dark Lord", but rather, "there will be a climactic event that settles the fate of the Dark Lord in some way". The plot twist here fulfills that promise. (It might also create a new promise that the heroes will do something about the minions.)

It's still quite possible to break this promise. The story could end without ever deciding the fate of the Dark Lord. Or it could decide their fate in a way that's not climactic, like if the heroes are just walking down the road when they see the Dark Lord get hit by a truck and die.

It also helps if your story is clear about whether it's <em>the kind of story where plot twists happen</em>. If you have a clever twist in the first chapter, the reader will expect more clever twists, and appreciate them when they happen. But if the story generally plays out straightforwardly, then they might be alienated by a big twist in the final chapter. This is because the implied promises are different. The first story promised "They'll go to face the Dark Lord… but there might be a twist! Read on and see!" The second story <em>actually</em> promised "They'll defeat the Dark Lord and save the world."

There's sometimes a good reason to actually break a promise. If you must break a promise, it's good to have a moment that makes it 100% clear that the promise is broken. That way, the reader won't be left wondering if you're going to get around to it.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I think about promise theory a lot while I'm writing my stories. I didn't choose the word "promise" until a few weeks ago when I started planning this post, but the concept has been about the same for years.

Along with this post, I've added a section to <a href="/ravelling-wrath/discussion">the author's notes of Ravelling Wrath, chapter 1</a>. It talks about exactly how I used promise theory while writing that chapter. I think it makes a pretty good example.

My hands are doing much better than they were a month ago! I've been able to do lots of things that I couldn't do for a while. I've been bicycling, I've been using scissors, I've been typing somewhat more, and lots of other stuff. Unfortunately, <em>drawing</em> is still being troublesome for me. I can currently draw for about 10 minutes at a time without problems, but I want to do much more than that. I might get there soon, but I might not.

My throat is also doing better. I think the problem was mostly allergies. I've been taking allergy meds and using air purifiers, and my throat's doing a lot better now, although it's not perfect. I even built an air-filter-on-a-hose to deliver filtered air straight to my face:

<img src="/media/air-filter-on-a-hose.jpg?rr" alt="[Photo: Me with an air hose coming from out of the picture and connecting to a box that sits just below my chin]" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">

I might eventually write up a full description of this device, the way I did with <a href="/blog/the-carrying-contraption">my carrying contraption</a>.


Today, I've been working on a web version of <a href="/hexy">[NSFW] Hexy Bondage</a>! The idea is that people will be able to play together on one computer/smartphone/tablet, rather than having to print it out. I have a complete prototype, but I still have a lot of polishing to do before I'm ready to publish it. <span class="hidden_from_restricted_users">(That said, the prototype is already available on the secret page for my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EliDupree">Patreon supporters</a>!)</span>


Also, Chapter 3 of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a> currently stands at about 3000 words. I'm guessing it'll be about 8000 words when it's done, like Chapter 2 is.

I've made a lot of progress on the web version of <a href="/hexy">[NSFW] Hexy Bondage</a>! I've been tweaking the rules a bunch. There were a bunch of ways the original rules could make things slow or confusing, even on a computer where you don't have to remember all the rules yourself. But I think I found a good way to fix a lot of the problems. My work isn't done yet, but there's a good chance it'll be ready for next week.

Also, I've been trying out drawing again! Yesterday, I decided to try out drawing the Voldemort's Children characters again:

<img src="/media/vc-sketch-2017-06-13.png?rr" alt="[Drawing: About 7 of the characters of Voldemort's Children, as a simple white line drawing on a black background.]" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">

That went well and only took me 10 minutes, so today, I did 15 minutes of work on the actual comic. I have to be extra careful not to hurt my hands, so I can't promise anything, but I have a vague plan to do 10 or 15 minutes of work every day or two and see how it goes.
