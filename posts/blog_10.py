<p>I used to carry my stuff &ndash; about eight pounds (3.6 kg) of it &ndash; like this:</p>

<img src="/media/old_case_over_shoulder_small.jpg?rr" alt="A picture of me carrying a laptop case with a single shoulder strap over my right shoulder, with the case at my left side." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Or rather, it looked like that, except that the case was puffed up more from all the stuff in it. I did that for about four years. Then on March 1, 2013, I started having some pain in my chest. The pain got worse the more I <cut>carried that case. So I started carrying it like this:</p>

<img src="/media/old_case_around_waist_small.jpg?rr" alt="A picture of me carrying the same case, but now the strap is wrapped around my waist, so that the center of it hangs in front of my left leg." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>That worked to relieve the pain. But it was also inconvenient to put on or take off. The strap didn't have clips on the ends<footnote((Actually, the strap <em>originally</em> had clips on <em>both</em> ends, and <em>both</em> of the clips broke during normal use. And the strap I'd had before that also had clips which broke. I no longer trust metal or plastic clips in positions that are both load-bearing and involve rubbing against other hard parts during normal use.))>, so I had to put the whole thing over my head every time I wanted to put it on or take it off. And it interfered with my walking (and worse, running), because it hung right in front of my leg. So, March 23-29, with some help from a family member, I designed and built this:</p>

<img src="/media/new_contraption_worn_small.jpg?rr" alt="A picture of me putting on some sort of contraption that has pouches at the left and right sides"/><img src="/media/new_contraption_worn_2.jpg?rr" alt="Me wearing the same contraption, shown from a different angle"/>

<p>This thing works great!</p>

<p>You could ask, as many others have asked, <q>What <strong>is</strong> that?</q></p>

<p>Let's open up the flaps and look:</p>

<img src="/media/new_contraption_displayed.png?rr" alt="A picture of me holding up the same contraption in one hand, with different parts labeled A through F." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<ol type="A">
  <li>A single alumnium flat, 1/8 in x 3/4 in x 4 ft, that holds up the pouches and goes around the back.</li>
  <li>Foam padding that rests on my hips, carrying the weight.</li>
  <li>Four straps (two on each side) with pairs of D-rings on them, so that the strap can be tightened to grip and hold arbitrary objects.</li>
  <li>A single strap across the front to hold it on. At one end is a pair of D-rings to adjust the tightness of the strap. At the other end is a hook that goes over the aluminum frame. This strap is <em>not</em> the main support, and it doesn't even press against the front of my body very much (it's held out front by the frame).</li>
  <li>Two metal clips (one on each side) for holding light objects that can be clipped on, like hair ties and gloves. (My winter gloves have their own clips/loops on them.)</li>
  <li>Vinyl<footnote((Not the best material in hindsight. The vinyl tears easily under stress. We just bought the thing that was both waterproof and on sale.))> with a felt-like backing. There are two big pouches to carry stuff in, two little pouches that hold the foam in place, and flaps that go over the top to keep off the rain.</li>
</ol>

<p>For those interested, I've <a href="/media/contraption_pattern.png?rr">drawn a pattern</a> for the vinyl pieces. (I may not be remembering the numbers exactly, but the pattern should make it clear how the thing is put together.)</p>

<p>The entire thing weighs 2 pounds (0.9 kg) when it's empty, whereas the case I was using weighs 2.5 pounds empty. The materials cost us around $20 in total.</p>

<p>For most purposes, this has been exactly what I wanted: It carries my stuff, it doesn't strain my body, and it doesn't interfere with my movement. The two sides carry about the same amount of weight, so it's balanced and stays out of the way.</p>

<p>Not all of it worked, though. The D-ring straps, which were sewn directly to the vinyl, eventually lost their grip when the vinyl started to tear. The pouches slide back and forth annoyingly &ndash; I added a few binder clips to hold them in place, but those clips don't hold on very well. And when I run, I have to keep adjusting it so that it doesn't slide forward/backward off my hips.</p>

<p>All of those can be fixed in the next version I build. This was great as a prototype, and it served me well for two months. I had to make some other things to organize the stuff <em>inside</em> the pouches, but that's a matter for another post.</p>

<p>A bunch of people have told me "You should patent this and make millions", but I'm not a capitalist, so I encourage you all to make your own versions of this if you want to. When I make my own next version, I might write some detailed instructions for making your own, with a "Please leave a donation if you can afford it" attached.</p>

<p>So, I said I wanted to post an awesome thing every week. That didn't happen. Instead, I got overheated.</p>

<p>I don't handle heat well. If it's above about 72&deg;F (23&deg;C), I stop being able to focus, I become very lethargic, and I get sleepy more easily, but I don't feel rested after sleeping. If it cools down again, I get better fairly quickly. I'd say it takes about 20 minutes to change my mental state, in either direction &ndash; although it's hard to measure.</p>

<p>Our house is normally cooled by a <a href="http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/heat-pump-water-heaters">heat pump water heater</a>. The one we had was broken. Then we replaced it. But I missed about a month's worth of work between when the heat started and when it cooled off.</p>

<p>Now I'm better, mostly. I've been working on a Javascript game project for the last week, although I don't have anything I can show to people yet.<footnote((I'm partially doing it as a prototype for part of Lasercake. So I'm working hard to make it robust internally, rather than making showy things.))></p>

<p>I'm still tired, though. When I go for a month without being excited about anything, it takes a while to get excited again. I'm not even impatient to finish VC, although I'm sure <em>that</em> feeling will come back before long.</p>

<p>I'll try to do the "post an awesome thing each week" thing again. To start with, I've done more experiments with biscuits that I should tell you about. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>I'm continuously updating the process for making <a href="/blog/i-made-biscuits">my biscuits</a>. A few batches ago, I took photos!</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-1.jpg?rr" alt="Me holding two one-pound bags of beans over a counter; a metal pot is in the background." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I start with these one-pound bags of beans (two cups dry). For this batch I used two bags, but now I usually use three. I put the beans in the pot, then fill it with water to about three times the depth of <cut>the beans, and put it in a refrigerator to soak overnight.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-2.jpg?rr" alt="Me holding lid on the pot, while I pour brownish water from it into the sink. (The water goes through the thin gap between the pot and the lid, so none of the beans come out.)" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Then in the morning, I pour off the water. Usually the water is less brown and more purple &ndash; I neglected to refrigerate this batch overnight. Good thing I didn't get sick from it.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-3.jpg?rr" alt="The pot full of beans sits in the sink, with tapwater pouring into it." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I refill the water, then pour it out again, to rinse the beans. I repeat that a couple of times. I use hot water for this, so that the beans warm up (so they'll boil more quickly in the next step).</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-4.jpg?rr" alt="The pot of beans sits on a stove, which has been turned on. A nearby timer reads '7:51'." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Then I boil the beans for half an hour on the electric stove you see here. Since this batch, I've started putting a teaspoonful of baking soda in with it, which makes the beans softer.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-5.jpg?rr" alt="The back of my head. I'm using a hair tie to tie my hair back." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Remember to tie back your long hair before messing with sticky things!</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-6.jpg?rr" alt="Three images: Me pouring whole wheat flour into a large metal bowl, me with two containers of salt, and me carefully pouring salt into a teaspoon above the bowl of flour." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>While I wait for the beans to finish boiling, I add the dry ingredients. For the usual amount (6 dry cups of beans), that's:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 cups whole wheat flour</li>
<li>2 tsp table salt</li>
<li>1 tsp potassium salt (KCl)</li>
<li>10 grams of eggshells (about two large eggshells)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since then, I've started adding quick oats to the mix, but I haven't settled on how much. I'll probably choose something like 3.5 cups flour, 4 cups quick oats. (The oats are less dense; by weight, 4 cups quick oats is the same as 2.5 cups whole wheat flour.)</p>

<p>I've also experimented with a bunch of other ingredients. I'll write about that at the end of this post.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-7.jpg?rr" alt="My hand holding the pestle of a mortar-and-pestle about the same width as my hand." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I used to grind up the eggshells with this cute little mortar-and-pestle, and mix them with the other dry ingredients. Now I just throw them in with the beans and oil (see below). Hand-grinding them made smaller bits, but was a lot of work.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-8.jpg?rr" alt="A food processor with a bunch of cooked beans in it." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>To help me mash the beans, I actually bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Processor-Compact-Storage/dp/B002V8RNH2/">this food processor</a>. I got a refurbished one for $43.<footnote((It came with a little card that said, essentially, "Thank you for buying refurbished products! We're not going to give you as much of a warranty as usual." It has worked quite well so far, even after I accidentally dropped it from the counter onto the floor.))> I've already saved more money by switching to this diet than I spent on this object. (These biscuits are now about 80% of the food I eat.)</p>

<p>There used to be a complex little ritual in here, in order to cool off the (just-boiled) beans enough to touch them, without letting them dry out and get tougher. Since I started using baking soda to soften them, I don't need to do that. Now I just pour them into a colander.</p>

<p>At first, there was a problem with using the food processor: a lot of the beans stuck to the plastic sides, so they didn't get chopped up.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-9.jpg?rr" alt="Me pouring canola oil from a 1-gallon bottle into a metal 1-cup measure." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I solved that problem by putting the canola oil in with the beans before running the food processor. I'm aiming for 3 cups of oil total, in about 18 cups of wet beans. So I put in two cups of beans at a time, with one-third cup of oil. (That seems to be the quantity the food processor can handle best.) And now I also put in the eggshells in with the first two cups of beans, after I break them up a bit by hand.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-10.jpg?rr" alt="The food processor again, now with beans mashed up." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Then I get this mess. It's been a lot smoother since I started using the baking soda to soften the beans.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-11.jpg?rr" alt="Some mashed beans have been dumped into the bowl dry ingredients." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Then I dump them in with the dry ingredients. Eventually everything is in the bowl and I can mix it together.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-12.jpg?rr" alt="A blurry image of my two hands stirring the ingredients together." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Mixing it is a challenge! Sometimes it is easier to use my hands directly than to use a spoon.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-13.jpg?rr" alt="The lumpy dough dumped out on a counter." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Eventually I can dump it out on the counter and start kneading it.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-14.jpg?rr" alt="My two hands pressing down on a piece of dough." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>After some kneading, it starts to become a coherent dough.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-15.jpg?rr" alt="Me rolling the dough out flat with a rolling pin." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>Finally, I can roll it out flat with a rolling pin.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-16.jpg?rr" alt="Me cutting a strip off the flattened dough with a knife. Nearby, there is a rack with some other strips of dough sitting on it." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>I cut the dough into strips to cook it. On the racks, the biscuit strips are exposed to the air on all sides, so they dry faster.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-17.jpg?rr" alt="Two racks covered in biscuit strips, with some of the other kitchen stuff nearby." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>The final arrangement, ready to go in the oven.</p>

<img src="/media/biscuits-130817-18.jpg?rr" alt="The same rack of biscuits being put into an oven, using potholders." style="display:block; margin: 2em auto;"/>

<p>And it goes in.<footnote((Actually, it didn't quite fit this way, and we arrange the racks differently now, and I don't have a good photo of that. Not that it makes a difference to you, dear readers, unless you happen to own exactly the same racks and same oven.))></p>

<p>I set the oven to 250&deg;F (121&deg;C), and then I set a timer. Every 20 minutes, I open the oven door a little to let out the steam. I keep doing this until not much steam comes out. That happens after a few hours. (It doesn't always take the same amount of time, and I don't understand everything that affects that process.) After that, I turn off the oven, but leave the biscuits in the (still hot) oven overnight.</p>

<p>And then I get these great biscuits! In fact, I ate one while I was writing this post.</p>

<p>But my sibling, who took these photos for me, has problems with eating wheat products. So we've been trying to design an alternate recipe without wheat. The trouble is, the wheat is what's holding the biscuit together in biscuit shape. We tried replacing it with corn meal, oat flour, quinoa flour, rice flour, and buckwheat flour. None of them except the buckwheat flour held together at all. They disintegrated if you tried to pick them up. And replacing wheat with buckwheat still made a weaker biscuit, although at least it was strong enough to pick up.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, what made the toughest biscuit was combining a <em>little</em> buckwheat flour with a lot of quick oats. It seems like the oats give the biscuit some structural strength, while the buckwheat keeps it from just falling apart. I didn't record the exact quantities, though.</p>

<p>I'm finally ready to distribute the sexual board game that I <a href="/blog/im-back">mentioned</a>. I've been sitting on the complete design for a few months, I just hadn't gotten around to making a web presence for it.</p>

<p>Given the <a href="/blog/sex"><q>losing at games</q> part of my sexuality</a>, I've often been disappointed that there aren't more sexual board games out there. Non-yucky ones, anyway. I've seen ads for a couple commercial ones, but they are yucky. They repeat gender stereotypes, and they portray sex as dirty, bad, or mischievous &ndash; <em>especially</em> BDSM and other kinds of creative sex. I don't want to think "tee hee, I'm violating taboos!" when I do sex things; I want the taboos to be completely irrelevant. (Some people especially enjoy violating taboos, and that's okay, but I don't feel that way myself.)</p>

  "contents":'''

<p>In the world of the game <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, people are grouped into nine "alignments". Each person is Good or Evil (or Neutral), and also Lawful or Chaotic (or Neutral). What do those mean? There are as many interpretations as there are D&D players. This post describes mine.</p>

<p>First, what are Law and Chaos? In D&D, these are called the "ethical axis". The story goes that lawful people are honest, honorable, respect authority, and value order above freedom. But which honor, which authority, and which order? And why <cut>is "order" grouped with "authority"? There are plenty of corrupt authority figures who want you to lie or cheat. Is it Lawful to obey them?</p>

<p>In my system, <span style="background-color: #ddddff">Law vs Chaos is the <strong>ideological axis</strong> of alignment. A Lawful person is one who tries to uphold or promote a specific ideology. A Chaotic person doesn't care which ideology wins, unless it helps zem with zir personal goals. All actions promote some ideologies and weaken others, but what matters is the reason for the action.</span> A person who tells the truth because ze believes everyone should be honest is Lawful. A person who tells the truth because ze wants people to trust zem is Chaotic.</p>

<p>Good vs Evil (officially the "moral axis") is harder. How do you define good and evil? And even if you can label everyone "good" or "evil", <em>should</em> you? If good and evil actions can just be added up, then you can say things like "I saved a village from a fire, so now I can get away with kicking 2.85 puppies". People even say that kind of thing in real life &ndash; when a popular person abuses someone, zir fans often don't believe the victim, because the popular person is already "one of the good guys". Besides, the good/evil distinction wastes a lot of storytelling potential. If your story has a villain, can that villain be Good? If half the characters usually can't be half the alignments, that seems like a waste of a cool alignment system.</p>

<p>My first thought was to twist it up a little. I made "Good" and "Evil" exist, but I made them intentionally misleading. I made "Good" mean "intends to help others" and "Evil" mean "doesn't care what happens to others as long as it benefits zem". There would be plenty of "Evil-aligned" people who are good, helpful and productive (because trust and social support can be more valuable than what you can get by cheating), and plenty of "Good-aligned" people who are evil, often choosing to harm others (because they falsely believe it will help, and refuse to change their minds). But I wanted my alignment system to be more than just a criticism of the standard one.</p>

<p>Instead, I replaced the alignments.</p>

<p>Now, <span style="background-color: #ffdddd">my <strong>social axis</strong> of alignment is Meddling vs Detached. A Meddling person is one who tries to have specific effects on others. A Detached person doesn't care what effects ze has on others, unless it helps zem with zir personal goals. All actions may help or harm others, but what matters is the reason for the action.</span></p>

<h2>Some examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Helping someone because you want them to feel good is <strong>Chaotic Meddling</strong>.
<li>Trying to change the world so that everyone will feel good is <strong>Lawful Meddling</strong>.
<li>Helping someone because you'll get something in return is <strong>Chaotic Detached</strong>.
<li>Wanting everyone to exchange favors like that is <strong>Lawful Detached</strong>.
<li>Hurting a person because you hate them is <b>Chaotic Meddling</b>.
<li>Hurting a person because you think they deserve to suffer is <b>Lawful Meddling</b>.
<li>Hurting a person to punish them, so that they won't violate a rule, is <b>Lawful Detached</b>.
<li>Hurting a person to coerce them into helping you is <b>Chaotic Detached</b>.
</ul>

<p>A lot of people think goodness is Lawful Meddling: a person has beliefs about what's good, and tries to impose those beliefs on the world. But no alignment is really better at being good than another. A Lawful person might fail by sticking to a particular set of rules even when those rules hurt people. A Meddling person might get too attached to the <em>idea</em> of helping someone, even when the best way to help is to give them space. A Chaotic Detached person is sometimes the best one to give help, because Chaos and Detachment don't try to force their own reality on a situation it doesn't fit. But a Chaotic person might help the person right in front of zem in a way that hurts more people later on, because ze wasn't thinking about the principles. And a Detached person might lose the motivation to help at all.</p>

<p>On each axis, you can also be <strong>Neutral</strong> or <strong>Nonaligned</strong>. A Neutral person is in between the two extremes &ndash; ze sometimes cares about affecting people are promoting ideologies, but not always, or not as strongly. A Nonaligned person doesn't fit on the axis at all. Ideologically nonaligned people don't understand that ideologies exist. Socially nonaligned people don't believe that the lives of others have any meaning &ndash; they believe people are no better off if you help them and no worse off if you hurt them (or they don't realize that other people exist at all). I came up with this idea by thinking about the character Ignus, from Planescape: Torment. Ze is a fire wizard whose only desire is for literally everything to be set on fire. Since ze is oblivious to the reality of people around zem, ze never truly makes a choice about whether to affect others, and so ze's Lawful Nonaligned rather than Lawful Detached (since a Detached person is someone who knows, but doesn't care).</p>

<p>You could ask me, why is it a good idea to divide people into these categories at all?</p>

<p>I don't actually know. I just found it really interesting to think about the design of the system.</p>

<p>I currently think of myself as <strong>Lawful Neutral</strong>. I try to make the world better for everyone, which seems Meddling, but I only do that because I <em>believe it's the right thing to do</em> (a Lawful motivation) rather than because I have any innate desire to make people feel better.</p>
