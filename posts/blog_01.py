<p><span class="atmosphere">It is the year 2013, or later. You have just navigated to the earliest post of Eli Dupree's wildly popular website, which has over 100,000 regular readers. Eli has released at least one full graphic novel here, as well as dozens of short stories, songs, games, and other cool things, and is currently in the midst of an even more massive project, which ze is hoping to finish within a month or two.</span></p>

<p>That's right, I'm talking to you &ndash; you, the reader. Usually, when someone writes "now", or uses present-tense verbs, they mean the time at which they're speaking. But in this post, the present is the time when you're reading it, which I have just claimed is the year 2013 or later. People who write blogs usually talk to the other people from the present, and I'm going to go back to doing that with my second post, but I thought it would be fun to talk to you people from the future instead, just for once. Of course, I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but it's a lot more fun to just assume I'm right than to stick a phrase like <q>I'm guessing that</q> in front of everything.</p>

<p>First posts weren't a thing that I thought I liked writing, back when I wrote this post in the middle of 2011. Usually, when I started to get involved in a new thing, I would try to do it a little at a time, rather than make a big, flashy entrance. After all, people usually get more skilled, not less, over time, so how can a first post, or first performance, or first musical album, ever hope to live up to what will come after it? But a good challenge is always fun, so here, the challenge was this: Make a first post that is <em>so awesome</em> that it will still be awesome now that you've seen everything that comes after it.</p>

<p>Since part of the point of this website is to advance the cause of social justice, I did consider the idea of ignoring the issue of awesomeness for this post, and dedicating it to some specific cause instead. On the other hand, I didn't want the symbolic nature of a <em>first</em> post to imply that I was setting up one issue as more important than the other. I wouldn't have been able to consider anything thoroughly, because I would have felt obligated to make everything perfect and even-handed, which is impossible &ndash; exactly the issue that made me reluctant to write an epic first post originally. I did make a lot of posts about various social issues soon after this one, but this one was completely dedicated to awesomeness; I didn't even bother to advocate on my own behalf by explaining the gender-neutral pronoun I used in the first paragraph!</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to make a bunch of ambitious claims about my future success!</p>

<h2>It's at least 2013</h2>

<p>The first question I had to ask myself was this: Who are you? Who will be reading this post? And that led me to a very interesting series of conclusions.</p>

<p>First, the way this website is set up, it is easy to go back to the beginning and read the first post. And there was really only a very short window of opportunity for this post to have been displayed on the first page; therefore, it's almost certainly true that you've deliberately looked back to read it, rather than reading it at the time it was posted.</p>

<p>Second, a good website's readership tends to increase exponentially over time, as more people hear about it, post links to it, and so on. What this means is that there are always a lot more late joiners than early joiners. However, the number of posts <em>I</em> make in that time doesn't increase exponentially, so the late joiners won't have a much harder time reading all the way back to the first post, even ignoring the readers who deliberately jump back to the beginning. This inevitably leads to the conclusion that more late joiners will read this post than early joiners. And what that means is that, assuming I keep producing this website through, say, 2016, <em>you are almost certainly arriving after 2013, regardless of how effectively I publicized it in 2011.</em></p>

<p>That raises some interesting issues. It means that I'm talking to the majority, while the people who read my posts within a few days are the minority. Most blog posts, by using present-tense verbs to refer to the <em>writer's</em> time, subtly privilege their present-day audience, by placing them in the present; they allow later readers to view the record of events, but do not directly address those readers. Or worse, the present tense refers only to the author's present, ignoring the readers entirely! When a person writes something, and another person reads it, there are two people involved; why should the language establish the time of one event, the writing, while ignoring the time of the other event, the reading, entirely? When I wrote the next few posts after this one, it was only linguistic convention that made me write for the minority of readers from the present, or the even smaller minority of myself. What justification did I have for mentally privileging the present-day minority over the silent majority of onlookers from the future? Or was the future truly so limited that it was right for me to have valued my influence on my present-day readers more highly?</p>

<p>Let's move on.</p>

<h2>I have 100,000 readers</h2>

<p>Okay, this one was a bit more of a gamble. I didn't actually know for sure that my website would become this popular. But when I made that gamble, the outcomes were skewed in my favor, for two reasons: First, if I was right, then <strong>lots</strong> of people would know I was right, while if I was wrong, relatively few people would know I was wrong. Second, if I was right, then it would be very impressive that I had accurately claimed such a large readership, while if I was wrong, it wouldn't have been that much of a disappointment, since it's such a high number I was aiming for in the first place. (True, if I've ended up with ten million readers by now, the 100,000 looks like a pittance, but I don't think you'll fault me for claiming <em>only</em> 100,000!) And by the same logic from the last section, if I ever have that many readers, then in the long run, most of the people who read <em>this</em> post will read it when my claims are true!</p>

<p>But that paragraph makes it sound like I wasn't actually that confident about my ability to acquire a large reader base. On the contrary, I definitely was! I had lots of reasons to believe that I would gain a wide following:</p>

<p>1) I went into this task with the specific intention of making my posts easy to read, engaging, and thought-provoking. I wanted this to be a website that all kinds of people could both enjoy and learn from. Thus, I had reason to hope that it would spread both among people who enjoyed reading it for its own sake, and also among people who were serious activists and liked the ideas it was expressing.</p>

<p>2) Remember that graphic novel I mentioned in the first paragraph? I released it one page at a time, in a serial format &ndash; i.e. as a webcomic. It's a well-known fact that publishing a webcomic with a regular update schedule brings readers back over and over again. And the e-mail notification system is also an effective way to keep up with the website without having to actively reload the page, for people who have e-mail addresses that they check regularly.</p>

<p>3) This should probably have been the first item on this list, because it's the most important: <em>The stuff I do is really cool</em>. That's why my website was able to spread so quickly by word of mouth (or word of blog, or word of instant message): Lots of people read it and wanted to tell their friends about it &ndash; people just like you! Sadly, doing really cool stuff isn't always enough to become popular. History, up to and including the present, is full of examples of marginalized people who did really cool things and weren't recognized for it. But in my case, my cool abilities combined favorably with my societal privileges to bring you a product that can hopefully work towards demolishing the very injustices that created this situation in the first place!</p>

<p>(Yeah, I was an optimist when I wrote this post. You'd better hope I still am.)</p>

<h2>I've done lots of massive projects</h2>

<p>I'm afraid I went for a bit of a cop-out on this one. Of <em>course</em> I'm working on a massive project... I'm <em>always</em> working on a massive project!</p>

<p>Writing this <em>website</em> was a massive project. Just before that, I finished up a semester of college by writing a <em>novella</em> (which I posted on this website later in 2011). Before I wrote the novella, I was working on writing my own <em>music composition software</em>, and in the middle of all that, I was acting in a full-length <em>play</em>. And a day or two after I wrote this post, I started working in earnest on my next massive project, where I wrote my own <em>graphics editing</em> software &ndash; the same software I went on to use to write the <em>graphic novel</em> I mentioned.</p>

<p>So, in short, I had this very clear knowledge: I would have been walking on treacherous ground if I had claimed that I <em>wasn't</em> working on a massive project right now.</p>

<p>So keep an eye on the website, whatever year you're viewing it in, because... you know that massive project I'm doing? I'm hoping to finish it within a month or two.</p>

  "force_date":datetime.date(2011, 6, 10),

  "contents":'''

<autotitle>

<p>On my website, I have made it so that whenever someone uses any form of the pronoun "she" or "he" in a post or comment, it appears with a mark of scrutiny. Observe: She, he, her, him, hers, his, herself, himself.</p>

<p>I also avoid using those pronouns myself, and use the gender-neutral pronoun "ze" instead. I've listed the forms of "ze", as I use it, in the table below:</p>

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-width: 1">
  <tr><th>As subject</th><th>As object</th><th>Possessive<br/>adjective</th><th>Possessive<br/>pronoun</th><th>Reflexive</th></tr>
  <tr><td>she</td><td>her</td><td>her</td><td>hers</td><td>herself</td></tr>
  <tr><td>he</td><td>him</td><td>his</td><td>his</td><td>himself</td></tr>
  <tr><td>they</td><td>them</td><td>their</td><td>theirs</td><td>themself</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ze</td><td>zem</td><td>zir</td><td>zirs</td><td>zemself</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Because to say "she" or "he" is to explicitly declare a gender for another person, and that level of explicitness should be matched by how visible the word is in the sentence.</p>

<p>Since "she" and "he" are structural components of the language, it's very difficult to avoid using them if you're not willing to modify the language itself. And because they're so hard to avoid, they actively divide all humans into two classes: The "she"-humans and the "he"-humans.</p>

<p>That division is called "the gender binary". I don't like it.</p>

<p>If you include the gender binary in every sentence you write, speak, or think, then it becomes part of what you think about when you think about any person. You start judging people based on their apparent gender, rather than on whatever is actually relevant to the discussion. Obviously, that's a pretty silly idea. And given our world's huge amount of public and private discrimination against humans who don't fall neatly into the gender binary (hi!), and against humans who fit neatly but fall on the "she" side, it's not just a pretty silly idea &ndash; it's a totally terrible idea.</p>

<p>Consider this: Have you ever felt uncomfortable because you didn't know what gender another person was? Now, have you ever felt uncomfortable because you didn't know what another person's favorite color was? If you answered "Yes" and "No", then welcome to the wonderful world of thinking that gender is a uniquely essential quality of a person!<footnote((This is also a great analogy because lots of people just assume you have a favorite color, but not everyone naturally has one!))> Our social norms say that you're supposed to judge other people based on their genders, and so a lot of people get uncomfortable when they can't do what they're "supposed" to. The whole system of judgment sneaks into your head by starting with the benign-seeming judgement of whether you're supposed to use the "she" pronouns or the "he" pronouns.</p>

<p>But that turns out to not be such a benign judgement at all. When you do it, you're helping society judge whether whoever you're talking about is a "she"-human, or a "he"-human, or someone who doesn't really fit in the little boxes they're supposed to fit in. And when I say "society", I mean the kid sitting in the front of your class who's going to bully the doesn't-really-fit kid when you're not looking (or maybe when you are). I mean your male friend who doesn't think they're being sexist, but who always talks over their female friends in conversations. I mean the person who lives down the street, who seems pretty nice, who tried to rape and murder another person last week, just because the other person didn't fit our standards of "she" or "he".<footnote((Well, usually it's not <em>just</em> because they didn't fit in the gender binary. Usually it's also because they were a person of color, and/or mentally disabled, and/or homeless, and/or... well, you get the idea.))> Obviously, when a person commits rape or murder, they bear the sole responsibility. But that person thought it was okay because people like <em>you</em> said, "I care so little about <em>those people</em> that I won't even change the way I talk to stop excluding them."</p>

<h2>So what do we do about it?</h2>

<p>I don't expect you to stop using those pronouns entirely, any more than I expect you to magically solve all the world's problems at once. What you <em>can</em> do is to notice when you do it, and be aware of how that affects the way you're communicating.</p>

<p>Now, if only we had a way to do that automatically get your attention whenever you let one of those words pass without comment...? OH RIGHT.</p>

<p>If you're more ambitious, you can start cutting back on your use of these gendered pronouns, and start using gender-neutral pronouns. There are a variety of options for this. One is to use the singular "they"; if you look back over this post, you'll see that I used the singular "they" a lot. In most cases, it's unobtrusive and it gets the job done. Some people say it's grammatically incorrect, but those people are wrong.</p>

<p>"They" doesn't always work, though &ndash; one of the advantages of "she" and "he" is that they're two separate words, so they can, given the right genders of people, refer to two different people unambiguously. Getting rid of them already loses that advantage &ndash; it means that even if you have a female person and a male person, you still have to use the same pronoun for both of them &ndash; and it only gets worse if you also have to use the same pronoun for a group of people as for the individuals. So, it helps to have a pronoun that is third-person, explicitly singular, and doesn't assign a gender. English didn't have any of those for a while, but now it has lots of them. If you've read this website much, you've probably noticed that I use one of them in particular: "ze".</p>

<p>Since the structure of "ze" is so similar to the existing pronouns, I have had an easy time adding it to my vocabulary. And it has another nice advantage over "they": When people argue that I shouldn't use it, it's easy to engage in the real conversation about gender, while with "they", it often gets bogged down as a conversation about grammar.</p>

<p>The other most common gender-neutral pronouns are the Spivak set: ey, em, eir, eirs, emself. I personally don't like this set, because I feel like I'm mumbling when I say them out loud, not to mention that "ey" and "em" both have other meanings, or at least are pronounced the same as words that do. But it's a set I've seen used in a bunch of places, so I thought it would be prudent to mention it here. It also bears mentioning that there are a bunch of different variants of "ze", from ze/hir/hir/hirs/hirself to zhe/zhim/zher/zhers/zhimself; I picked the set I use simply because it feels the most natural to me.</p>

<p>That concludes my thoughts for now. Since this is the reference post for everywhere that "she" and "he" are scrutinized, I may update it from time to time.</p>

<p>This is going to be one of those posts that make me think "Why am I writing a post about this instead of doing it?!". But it's late at night and I'm not <em>really</em> going to get anything done before the morning, so I might as well go ahead and write this up.</p>

<p>So, I wrote a graphic short st&ndash; No, wait, I'm going to tell this in chronological order, starting from way back in the beginning. We could have a long argument about where the beginning really is, and whether it's really a net or lattice rather than a linear story that starts at a single beginning point, but we're not going to do that, because I'm the one telling this story, and I've picked one beginning point that I like best.</p>

<p>It begins with me dorking around with the images from an old computer RPG called <i>Sword Dream</i>. Or maybe it was <i>Yipe!</i>. How old am I &ndash; ten? Anyway, it was basically me taking images and drawing over them or recombining them. I wasn't very good at it, but it wasn't hard to do things like copying the head of a monster to make a monster that had two heads, or stuff like that. I had an <em>idea</em> of what I wanted to accomplish, but my tools didn't let me accomplish that. I was using old Mac software &ndash; GraphicConverter and ClarisWorks. Later, I started using the GIMP, but it wasn't much of an improvement, because it had the same basic problem: It wasn't a seamless extension of my underlying wills and desires! There's a saying, "Only a bad worker blames their tools"<footnote((Okay, that's not the original saying, but I think it's nicer when we don't use sexist and classist language.))>, but that saying was written by people who didn't have computers. Why should I ever do work that my computer can do for me? If you know me, you know that I insist on automating everything that can possibly be automated.</p>

<p>Shuffle the timeline around a bit because I don't remember what order this next stuff comes in. I spend lots of time drawing stuff in school &ndash; doodling, you might call it. I drew a lot of dragons. I mostly drew them in the same style &ndash; bold lines and shapes, little to no shading. When I did draw pictures where I used shading more, people told me they looked better, because they were more "realistic", but I didn't like them. What's the point of being realistic? If I wanted a realistic picture, I'd take a photograph. No &ndash; the goal of art is to produce something that's <em>better</em> than realism. It's to project our wills and desires through the medium and onto our audience. (To break the narrative a bit, look at my avatar on this site &ndash; the circular face with the yellow background, the broken-off pieces, and the wizard's hat. There's not a realistic image in the world that could convey the ideas that image conveys.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I go through some more computer games, most notably Spiderweb Software's <i>Blades of Exile</i>, and finally came to rest at the modern Free-and-open-source game, <i>Battle for Wesnoth</i>. (You'll probably hear more about my exploits in the BfW community in some other posts, too; I've committed a huge amount of time to it.) BfW had an active community of artists, and I learned a bunch of stuff from them. I tried my hand at making graphics for the game, but I was constantly frustrated by the software I had available to me. I actually liked ClarisWorks <em>better</em> than the GIMP for sprite editing<footnote((Oh by the way, a static 2d image used by a computer game is called a "sprite".))>, because it had a simpler user interface, without all the fancy controls of the GIMP. But I was picking the lesser of two evils. At some point during this time period, I decided that I should write my own sprite editing software, tuned to that specific task instead of being a general-purpose graphics editor like the GIMP. That's not what I'm doing now; I will probably never do that, because sprite art is a horrible kludge that only exists because of the limited resolution of computer monitors. Moving on...</p>

<p>Fast forward about three years. I've taken some serious art classes in high school, which made me pretty good at drawing things in a photo-realistic way, which is nice even if it's not the most important skill to have.<footnote((At the time of this writing, you can see some of my work from one of those classes at <a href="http://eli.cedarswampstudios.org/drawing-1-sketchbook">this page</a> of my old website.))> It's my third semester of college. There are two cool creative writing courses offered in January. One of them is a prose memoir course taught by a person who everybody thinks is the coolest creative writing professor ever. The other is course about the graphic novel. The first class fills up very fast, and I don't want to compete for a slot in it, so I sign up for the second. AND THEN MY FATE IS SEALED.</p>

<p>During January, I write the graphic short story <a href="/people-are-wrong-sometimes">People Are Wrong Sometimes</a>, and I think, "Why the hell didn't I get into this medium earlier?" This is the <b>perfect</b> medium for me &ndash; the way I see it, the essence of a work of art is to effectively express an interesting idea, and a graphic narrative combines the abstract expressiveness of language with the instant expressiveness of images, resulting in a storytelling mode that can express ideas so fast that it can almost do justice to the overflowing supply of ideas that's inside my head.</p>

<p>There's just one catch. It takes frickin' ages! To draw that story, I sketched it in pencil, then drew over it in pencil, then drew over it in pen so that it would come out more clearly to the computer, then scanned it into the computer, then touched it up, then colored it in the computer. And when I colored it, I had to manually separate the lines from each other. This is a <em>tragedy</em>. All of those things were possible to automate, and therefore, they should have been automated.</p>

<p>So I'm going to automate them now.</p>

<p>First, a pencil? Seriously? Why would I ever draw something on paper, which has the unique property of <em>being unable to be analyzed and manipulated at the slightest thought</em>, when I could draw in raw data? Step one of my automation is to get a graphics tablet &ndash; a device that lets you draw and have your hand movements be immediately translated into computer data. There's no reason for me to ever deal with physical media in the first place, and having the computer record my drawing means that I can easily mark which lines are which, rather than having to manually separate them afterwards. Of course, this all means that my first task is to do super blitz research on the tablet market and how I can get a bargain on one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I need to research the underlying computer format of the tablet input. Or, at least, I need to find other people's code that can accept the input, so that I can use it for my own work. And I also need to learn more about how to read and write existing image file formats.</p>

<p>Once I have a tablet and figure out how to take input from it, it's just a matter of<footnote((And I make it sound so simple! It is not simple; I just happen to be really, really good at getting my ideas straight, which makes this step the one that I'm most confident about doing well, even though it's probably the most difficult step in abstract terms.))> experimenting with different ways of processing that information until I have ones that are near-perfectly in tune with my internal ways of understanding how I produce art. And creating internal data structures that I can easily manipulate and change when I decide I want to restructure my stuff. This is all going to sound a little abstract until I actually get started on doing it, but trust me, once I get going, I will have awesome powers. AWESOME POWERS.</p>

<p>Wacom is notable not just for being, essentially, <em>the</em> name in graphics tablets, but also for the fact that they're the only major graphics tablet producer that supports Linux-based operating systems. I happen to run a Linux-based OS (namely Ubuntu) on my computer, so that's a necessary feature. There are existing <a href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/">free and open source Linux drivers</a> for Wacom tablets<footnote((Maybe at some point I should also write about why the freedom to dissect and modify the software you use is important, but that's a bit of a daunting task for this post.))>. All other companies that produce tablets, by not having such drivers, have voluntarily rejected my money, which made my choice as a consumer very easy!</p>

<p>(You can tell I'm an expert on the tablet market because I spent a few hours researching it on Google!)</p>

<p>The tablet is supposed to arrive between June 16 and June 21. Since most of the work of this project is in experimentation once I actually receive the tablet, I might be a bit stalled for the next 5-8 days. I guess that gives me plenty of time to learn about file formats &ndash; maybe I should write a program that can load, make simple edits, and save a .png file, as an exercise to make sure I know my stuff.</p>

<p>But that means I need to decide what programming language to write it in! I'd love to write it in Haskell, which is a truly wonderful language, but I haven't written much Haskell code before, and there are a lot fewer existing libraries<footnote((A "library" is a bunch of general-purpose code that can be used in a lot of different projects. For instance, libpng is a library of C code that loads and saves .png files, and it can be used in any project that needs to deal with .png files.
