"blurb": "A disparaging joke is actually worse than a disparaging statement.",
"contents":'''

Joe tells a disparaging joke, and a few people laugh. Candace replies "That's not funny!" Joe counters, "Yes it is. Look, someone laughed at it."

Joe may be technically correct. The joke was well-crafted and made people laugh. But that's not what Candace meant. What really happened here?

Really, Candace just wants people not to say disparaging things. In some other world, the conversation might go like this: Candace says "Don't say that. It's disparaging." Then Joe says "What? It's just a joke!"

Many people believe that something can be "just a joke", making it less bad. But a disparaging joke is actually <em>worse</em> than a disparaging statement. First, a joke is enjoyable, encouraging people to repeat it. Someone might go to all their friends, saying "I just heard this great joke!", but it's much less common for someone to run around saying "I just heard this great disparaging statement!". Second, the joke makes people let down their guard. People may simply laugh and absorb the joke, without stopping to think whether it's right or wrong. For both these reasons, the better a joke is (in technical joke-craft), the <em>more</em> damage it can do from a moral perspective.

I'll put it this way: the funnier a joke is, the more <strong>joke power</strong> it has. Other things <cut>can also affect joke power. The more people are heard laughing at a joke, the more powerful it becomes. (That's why a lot of comedy shows have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track">laugh tracks</a>.) And the more popular the person telling the joke is, the more powerful it is. Like all forms of power, joke power can be used either for good or for evil.

When Candace said "That's not funny!", it wasn't <em>wrong</em>, because it wasn't a statement of <em>fact</em>. It didn't mean "That joke does not cause anyone to be amused." Instead, it was a statement of what <em>should</em> be: "Let's all refuse to laugh at that joke." By refusing to laugh, we can reduce the power of the joke and discourage the joker from telling that kind of joke in the future.

"That's not funny" isn't the only technique for this, of course. Maybe you say "That's not okay" or "That's not cool". Maybe you calmly ask the joker to explain the joke, which can make them uncomfortable by forcing them to think about the actual meaning of the joke. Maybe you have some authority you can use: "Hey. No telling racist jokes in my club." Different strategies work in different circumstances.

But in any case, don't think, "That joke was disparaging, but it was funny." Think instead, "That joke was disparaging, <em>and worse</em>, it was funny &ndash; so it's extra important to strike back against it."

I've been sort of sick for a few days, so I'm not up to writing a serious blog post. So instead, I'll take this time to give an update on what I've been doing recently.

<h2>My hands</h2>

In <a href="/blog/eli-status-august-2016">my last status update</a>, I mentioned that my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adductor_pollicis">adductor pollicis</a> hadn't been doing its job. Since then, we've discovered that the same thing happened with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_interossei_of_the_hand">first dorsal interosseous muscle</a>, which also helps the thumb move. Training that muscle has given me another big improvement in how well my hands work. A couple weeks ago, I actually drew for 30 minutes straight, which was manageable (although close to my limit at the time). They're not feeling quite as good now, but they are normally worse when I'm sick, so they may still be improving overall.

<h2>My projects</h2>

Writing <a href="/stories/the-23-days-cult">The 23 Days Cult</a> turned out to be a much bigger project than I had planned for. It left me pretty burnt out, and I didn't manage to get excited about another project for the month after that. I did manage to do some work on a game modding thing in Wesnoth, which is fun, but it's not one of the Great Works Of Elidupree.com. I also randomly learned how to livestream games on Twitch. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/EliDupree">Here's my Twitch page, if you're interested in that kind of thing.</a>

But yesterday I think I finally got excited about something again &ndash; continuing work on <a href="/hexy">[NSFW] Hexy Bondage</a>. I actually made a couple changes to the rules, more than a year ago, but I never published the changes, because my original publishing process was INCREDIBLY inconvenient. So first I was thinking of improving the publishing process. But now I'm also hoping to make an online version of the game, which you could play on a computer or smartphone or whatever. I'm not sure if I'll stick to this project &ndash; we'll have to see how I feel when I'm not so sick. But I'm pretty excited about it so far.

"title": "Whoops, we are violating people's freedom of speech all the time",
"tags": ["philosophical"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "It's not enough to say “I will never punish any speech”.",
"contents":'''

"Freedom of speech" can mean a lot of different things, but mostly boils down to this: <em>Don't punish people for what they say</em>. Different people have different reasons for thinking this is important. Here are a few perspectives:

<ol type="A">
<li>People benefit individually from saying what they want to.</li>
<li>Society as a whole benefits from people saying what they want to.</li>
<li>Punishment causes material harm to people (regardless of whether there's a justification for it).</li>
</ol>

For C, the size of the punishment is important. Killing someone for denouncing the tyrant is much worse than yelling at someone for denouncing the tyrant. But for A and B, the only thing that matters is <em>what speech actually happened</em>. If 10 people stay quiet because they're afraid of being yelled at, that has the <em>same</em> effect as 10 people staying quiet because they're afraid of being killed, or 10 people having their messages blocked by official censorship. This will be important later.

<h2>Here's one way we screw it up</h2>

Consider these two scenarios:

Scenario #1: If you're caught denouncing the tyrant, the tyrant's soldiers will throw you in a hole until you starve.

Scenario #2: You are already in a hole. The tyrant's soldiers don't care what you say. A few people are willing to feed you, but only in exchange for you consistently praising the tyrant.

Do you have more freedom of speech in scenario #2? Of course not. For <cut>perspectives A and B, the incentive for you to stay quiet is the same. For perspective C, the material harm to you is also the same, or worse. The only difference is that there's not such an obvious "bad guy".

Scenario #2 is the <em>de facto</em> state of freedom-of-speech in a lot of the United States. Even in my middle-class community, a lot of people change how they talk online because they're afraid of losing their jobs. And I've heard that it's much worse among working-class people, who have less job security and less ability to bring lawsuits if their bosses fire them illegally.

In our current system, most people have to sell their labor in order to survive. And for many people, it won't be easy to find a new job if they lose their current one. As long as these two things are true, the threat of losing your job is in the same general category as the threat of being beaten up or put in prison. Your freedom of speech is only as strong as your social safety net.

If you're interested in protecting freedom of speech, creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">universal basic income</a> might be the most effective policy.

<h2>Another situation</h2>

Again, two scenarios:

Scenario #3: I run an online community. Joe the sexist troll says rude things to the female members whenever they say anything. As a result, many of the female members hesitate to speak up, and a lot of them leave.

Scenario #4: I ban Joe from the community. Everyone else is fine.

In scenario #4, I did technically <em>punish somebody for what they said</em>. But as a result, more people found the opportunity to say what they wanted to. Thus, under perspectives A and B, there was <em>more total freedom of speech</em>. There's a small trade-off &ndash; I don't <em>intrinsically</em> want to stop Joe from having fun, but stopping Joe from having fun accomplishes a greater good for other people.

If you're deciding policy for a group, and you want to make sure that the group members can speak freely, it's not enough to say "I will never punish any speech". You have to consider what problems might discourage the members from speaking. If you have harassers in your group, what are you going to do about them? If some members have more resources or influence than others, how do you make sure they don't control the conversation? If you've misused your own authority in the past, how do you assure people that they're safe speaking in front of you this time?

"title": "Brain technique: “Patient problem-solving”",
"tags": ["neurodiversity"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "Here is a trouble I sometimes have: I sit down to solve a problem, but I can't figure it out right away, and I get frustrated.",
"contents":'''

This post is part of a series about my brain training techniques. It might help to read <a href="/blog/how-to-train-your-brain-part-1">Part 1</a> and <a href="/blog/how-to-train-your-brain-part-2-memory">Part 2</a> first if you haven't.

Here is a trouble I sometimes have: I sit down to solve a problem, but I can't figure it out right away, and I get frustrated. Maybe it's a story I'm trying to write, maybe it's a computer program I'm trying to design, maybe it's a big decision I'm trying to make. Whatever it is, my brain forms this memory:

<strong>Try to solve the problem &#8594; Argh, I'm stuck</strong>

So I come back and try again later. But after one or two attempts, my brain starts jumping straight to "Argh, I'm stuck", without even making a good try at the problem first. Worse yet, being frustrated makes me more stuck, and being stuck makes me more frustrated. It <em>reinforces</em> the memory that's causing trouble!

To deal with this, I need a technique. The technique needs two things: First, it should avoid <em>triggering</em> the bad memory. Second, it should avoid <em>creating</em> any more bad memories.

I call my technique "patient problem-solving". The first part of the technique is to <cut>have a <strong>background task</strong>. For me, this is usually browsing the Internet, going for a walk, or playing casual video games. But a lot of different things would work &ndash; perhaps knitting, drawing, or whatever your favorite idle activity is. The only limitation is that you still have to be able to look at the problem. (So, for instance, going for a walk doesn't work if you need to refer to a textbook.)

While I'm doing the background task, I frequently remind myself to glance at the problem. I try to see if there's anything new I can notice about it, that I didn't spot before. Sometimes, I make some progress on the problem. That's great! Usually, I don't see anything new. But because I didn't <em>expect</em> to make progress every time, I don't get frustrated. That way, I can just flow back to the background task. A minute or so later, I'll be ready to glance at the problem again.

The key here is that the background task is, in some sense, the main thing that I'm doing. The background task will keep me interested <em>whether or not</em> I get anything done on the problem. The worst-case scenario is that I just play video games for an hour without getting anything done &ndash; but that's something I might have done anyway, so it doesn't feel frustrating at all!

Usually, though, I actually do make some progress. "Patient problem-solving" is a bit slower than focusing on the problem directly, and it isn't ideal for making something complete and polished, but it's great for getting a few insights when I'm stuck on something. Usually, I can "patient problem-solve" for a while, and then feel like I'm ready to work on the problem directly after that.

"title": "What my internal language is made of",
"tags": ["neurodiversity"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "The brain actually has a lot of different subsystems, which all work in different ways.",
"contents":'''

This post is part of a series about my internal language. It might help to read <a href="/blog/imagine-a-ball-but-not-what-color-it-is">the first post</a> first if you haven't.

What is my internal language made of? It's pretty hard to explain.

Normal English has a few words talking about what goes on inside the brain. <em>Think. Feel. Visualize. Imagine.</em> But those words aren't very specific. The brain actually has a lot of different subsystems, which all work in different ways. Scientific language gets into a bit more detail: We have visual processing, spatial processing, language processing, working memory, long-term memory, and a lot of other things. (We know that these are separate because you can damage specific parts of the brain and cause <em>one</em> of them to stop working, while the others work just the same as before!) But even the science is pretty imprecise about a lot of things. I'll have to make up some of my own terms.

All my thinking relies on my <strong>main network</strong>. Scientifically, I think I'm referring to my long-term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory">implicit memories</a> or maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_memory">semantic memories</a>. (I'm not sure there's actually a distinction between those two things, at least for me.) Most of these memories are about relations between <strong>words</strong>.

When I say "words", I don't just mean <em>English</em> words. Everything that <cut>I can think about counts as a "word". The color red is a "word". Standing up is a "word". (My main network stores memories that <em>connect</em> those words to the English words for the same things, but they are not the same words.) But most of my words are actually internal things.

A lot of my other subsystems, like working memory, <em>interact</em> with the main network. I'll talk about that in another post. This one is about the words themselves.

When I have an internal word, it doesn't do much all by itself. It's defined by its relations with <em>other</em> words. For example:

<h2>Example #1: "[probably bogus]"</h2>

A month ago, I noticed myself having a thought, which I will translate like this:

"That sounds like it's probably bogus (although I'm not completely sure). But my belief that it's bogus is subject to confirmation bias, in the sense that, even if it's actually true, I might just keep thinking it's bogus every time it comes up, and never bothering to check it, so I should make sure to check it."

This thought was <em>two words long</em>: "[probably bogus] [subject to confirmation bias]". I thought it as quickly as you could say "Bullshit! Wait…", and then I smoothly went on with the conversation. But I did make sure to remember it for later.

How did I think such a complex thought so quickly? Remember, each word is not complex <em>by itself</em>. It only has a complex meaning because it is <em>linked</em> to lots of other words. When I thought those two words, I didn't <em>consciously follow</em> all of those links. I just remembered the words, so that I could follow the links later when I needed to explain it. This is probably what happens for most people when they think of <em>any</em> complex idea.

I did follow at least <em>one</em> link at the time. The second word has a strong link to "I must remember to do this". Following that link made me record the thought for later reference.

These words make a good example because they are easy to translate into English, albeit verbose. Other words can be trickier:

<h2>Example #2: "[ability/habit]"</h2>

For most of my life, people have called me "observant". I'm always looking around and noticing the things around me. Should I call this an "ability" or a "habit"? "Habit" is okay, but it doesn't necessarily do the job. Because I'm always looking around, I can find things other people wouldn't be able to find, and I can learn things other people wouldn't learn. That sure sounds like an "ability". But it would sound silly to say that other people don't have the "ability" to look around a lot.

Here's another one: I write a lot of computer programs. This is definitely an "ability". But if I just say "I have the ability to write computer programs", that doesn't express the fact that I <em>actually do it</em> very much. But it also sounds strange to say "I have a habit of writing computer programs". You don't usually say "habit" for something that is a complicated skill to do at all.

In my internal language, this isn't a problem. I have a single word that translates equally well as "ability" and "habit". The full definition would be something like this: "Something that a person can, and does, do a lot." The closest English translation is "practice", as in "ze has a practice of writing computer programs", but that's excessively formal, and people generally aren't used to that meaning of "practice".

I hope this post has helped you learn something! In the next post in this series, I think I'll talk about how I assemble my words into more complex ideas, especially using my spatial working memory.

"title": "Positive and negative characterization",
"tags": ["writing"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "I think about this a lot for characters in my stories. Negative characterization is harder to write, and harder to notice, but equally important.",
"contents":'''
If you're acting on stage, and don't have real furniture, you can use pretend furniture instead. You can put things on an imaginary table. You can eat breakfast at the imaginary table. You can chop vegetables on the imaginary table.

But to make it feel real, you also have to walk <em>around</em> the table whenever you want to get somewhere. The moment you walk <em>through</em> the table, the illusion is broken. Now, the audience may not be paying attention to the table, so they won't consciously realize what happened. But as soon as someone walks through the table, the audience will automatically stop believing in it. They just won't know <em>why</em>.

Chopping vegetables on the table is <strong>positive characterization</strong>. <em>Never</em> walking through the table is <strong>negative characterization</strong>. In general, <strong>positive characterization</strong> is when it's interesting that you <em>did</em> something, and <strong>negative characterization</strong> is when it's interesting that you <em>never</em> do something. (Or that you <em>always</em> do something, which is similar to never-not-doing the thing.)

I think about this a lot for characters in my stories. When I'm designing a character, I think: what are some interesting <cut>things this character does? Maybe ze is sad a lot, or plays sports, or drinks the blood of the living. That part is the positive characterization. But what are some interesting things this character <em>never</em> does? Maybe ze never laughs, or is never dishonest, or never enters a home uninvited. In <a href="/voldemorts-children">Voldemort's Children</a>, where Harry's abusers told zem not to ask questions, I made Harry <em>never</em> ask a question (at least, for most of the story). The other main characters have important negative characterization as well.

Negative characterization is harder to <em>write</em>, and harder to <em>notice</em>, but equally important. A lot of stories, especially from inexperienced writers, have "walking through the table" moments. Let's say a character is supposed to panic and freeze up when something bad happens. So the writer makes zem do that a few times in the story. But at some point, there's a scene that just says everybody is running away from a monster or something, and the writer just doesn't explain how this <em>particular</em> character handled it. For the character to be really distinctive, you want zem to <em>never</em> respond to a crisis without panicking for at least two paragraphs.

To be fair, it can be hard to do. You've already thought of the plot you want to write, and the characters are always trying to mess it up. That writer just wanted everyone to escape so that ze could get on with the story. For me, a lot of scenes would be easier to write if I could just have Harry ask a question. But if you want your negative characterization to be effective, you have to do it right <em>every</em> time. If you want Harry to learn something, you <em>always</em> need a reason why someone explains it unasked. If an extremely independent character follows along with a group, you <em>always</em> need to show why they wanted to be there. If a vampire is in a house, you <em>always</em> have to explain who invited zem.

Finally, if your negative characterization has been consistent for most of the story, there are times when you can <em>deliberately</em> break it for great effect. The moment when the silent character speaks for the first time can be huge. Or the moment when the joker gets serious. Or the person who never smiles finally smiles. If you have a character who <em>always</em> checks everything and takes all the safety precautions, you can show the urgency of a crisis by having zem rush in without checking anything. If you've done it really well, the reader will instantly know there's a crisis just by how the character is acting, before you even reveal what happened.

But just like <em>breaking</em> negative characterization can make a powerful moment, you can also make a powerful moment where you <em>maintain</em> it, but with a new importance. Maybe the silent character is the only one who doesn't swear loyalty to the new tyrant. Maybe the joker <em>continues</em> telling jokes while everything falls apart around zem. Maybe the careful character <em>does</em> take the time to check everything, even while the bad guys are breaking down the door.

Thinking about negative characterization helps me write stories. It also helps me understand why I like or dislike other people's stories. It's a powerful tool that can be used in a lot of different ways.

"tags": ["philosophical"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "The law has its own opinions about what your name is, who your family is, where you live, and so on. But these don't always match reality.",
"contents":'''

Laws often try to regulate personal things. The law has its own opinions about what your name is, who your family is, where you live, and so on. But these don't always match reality. You might go by a different name. You might live with a different family. You might spend most of your time in a different place.

When the law is wrong about your life, that can cause problems. Some are minor inconveniences, but others are much worse. I've heard of laws giving "family members" the right to make decisions for someone, even after the person severed all ties with them for being abusive. And of course, the law can endanger trans people by outing them by using an incorrect gender marker.

For this post, I'm going to use the example of gay marriage. I'm not a huge fan of marriage, but I think it makes a good example here. In many countries, there are laws that give certain privileges to straight couples, but don't give those privileges to gay couples. This is absolutely <a href="/blog/a-critique-and-defense-of-equality">unfair</a>. But I'm going to look at a much sutler question: do these laws prevent gay people from <em>getting married</em>?

<h2>The argument for "no"</h2>

When people say "marriage", they're usually talking about a <cut>social relationship &ndash; a personal and/or religious commitment. They're not talking about a mishmash of legal privileges, like hospital visitation and joint tax filing. In this sense, these laws don't make gay marriage illegal at all.<footnote((<em>Some</em> countries have laws that outright criminalize gay relationships. That just isn't the subject of <em>this</em> post.))> It's still completely -perform a marriage ceremony. It's legal to live together with any kind of relationship or commitments that you choose.

The only thing the law does is refuse to <em>acknowledge</em> or <em>privilege</em> your relationship. But you can't get a legal certificate saying what your hobbies are, either, and that doesn't mean your hobbies are illegal.

<h2>The argument for "yes"</h2>

Look at what happens in places where the laws change. When the government starts acknowledging gay marriages, many gay couples go out and get married &ndash; and not just in the legal sense of getting a certificate at an office. They actually do the ceremonies and feel like they now have the <em>social</em> relationship of marriage.

Presumably, a lot of these are people who <em>would</em> have gotten married earlier if the law had supported it. If a change in the law can <em>cause</em> some people to marry or not-marry, the law must have had some form of control. If the law never actually punished people for marrying, so what? That just means that its control was exerted in some <em>other way</em>. In fact, perhaps this form of control is <em>more</em> effective than punishment. After all, laws that punish drug use don't stop people from using drugs. But I think the law's effect on gay marriages may have been much bigger.

I would say this: A law's control is often not based on punishment, but on <em>trust</em>. Drug users know they can't trust the law. But too many people trust the law to define other people's personal relationships, and sometimes their own as well.

Let's not place our trust in unjust laws.

"title": "How will creative workers be paid?",
"tags": ["philosophical"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "A good idea can be shared with everyone for free. Indeed, that's what SHOULD happen. But how will the worker get paid?",
"contents":'''
Suppose you work all day building tables, and you want to get paid for your work. You can have a pretty straightforward business model. You can show people your tables, and say, "Give me X dollars, and I will give you one table." People need tables, and they can't pull free tables out of thin air, so you'll probably be able to find people to buy them.

If your work is <em>ideas</em>, things are different. A good idea can be shared with everyone for free. Indeed, that's what <em>should</em> happen, to make the world better for everyone. But how will the worker get paid? Even if you tried to hoard your ideas and sell them, you wouldn't be able to <em>show</em> them to potential buyers without giving them away.

When I talk about "creative workers", you might think of artists, writers, and musicians. But I also mean <em>any</em> <cut>worker who mainly works to produce reusable information. That includes scientists, engineers, mathematicians, software developers, and many other things. And as time goes on, more and more traditional jobs are being done by machines. We should prepare for a future where almost <em>all</em> work is creative work.

There have been a lot of different ways to pay creative workers. I'll discuss some of them here:

<h2>Patronage</h2>

Also known as "you get paid if a rich person likes your work".

This clearly isn't an ideal system. It may be <em>good</em> when rich people are generous, but it's not something we should rely on to pay everyday workers.

<h2>"Intellectual property" controls</h2>

Copyright and patent law allow you to <em>pretend</em> that your work is a traditional product. They let you ban people from sharing and reusing your work. This forces them to use it the way they would normally use a table, not the way they would normally share and reuse information. That way, you can potentially charge them money for the privilege.

This is obviously inconvenient for other people, but it also creates a unpleasant trade-off for <em>you</em> as well. The more you restrict people from sharing your work, the fewer people will learn of it in the first place. And the fewer people learn of it, the fewer will pay you. It's actually worse than a popularity contest, because you have to sabotage your own popularity in order to get paid.

Information isn't a traditional product, and we shouldn't try to force it to be one.

<h2>Voluntary donations</h2>

<p class="hidden_from_restricted_users">This is the approach I'm trying to take with my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EliDupreeBlog">Patreon pages</a>.</p>

The ideal situation is that you share all of your work for free to everyone, and also get paid for it. Voluntary donations can <em>sometimes</em> achieve this ideal. A lot of webcomic artists use this model. Some also try to make money by selling <em>merchandise</em>, which is similar. (The main work is free, and you make money by selling related physical objects.)

The problem is that you can't make a living this way without having a large audience. And <em>getting an audience</em> isn't easy, even if your work is good. It often involves doing your work for a long time <em>without</em> getting paid. What kinds of people can work for a long time without getting paid? People who already have enough money to support themselves.

I started out with a lot of resources, so I can afford to take the risk that I won't get popular enough. But unless <em>everyone</em> starts with a lot of resources, this isn't a realistic way to pay most creative workers.

<h2>Government programs</h2>

The government can tax everyone, and then pay directly for people to do research and art.

Creative work benefits everyone, but can't force anyone to pay for the benefit. The government, on the other hand, <em>does</em> force people to pay. I don't know if that's <em>good</em>, but that's a subject for a different post.

All the previous methods rely on you getting a rich patron or a large audience. Government programs pay creative workers directly, avoiding this problem. I think they have a useful place in the "creative work ecosystem".

However, I wouldn't want to <em>all</em> creative work to be controlled by the government. If the government pays for art, it may end up censoring that art. And my government doesn't have a great track record for running programs fairly.

<h2>Being a college professor</h2>

Colleges have an <em>interesting</em> position in society. Theoretically, they're places of vibrant intellectual community. But they also usually rely on rich patrons or the government. And they can be inaccessible to students who don't have enough money to begin with.

Certainly, some creative workers thrive as college professors. But can this support the majority of creative workers? I don't really envision a world where we turn every city block into a college. Even if that becomes economically practical, I don't think it's the right form of community for everyone.

<h2>A basic income</h2>

Earlier, I said, "unless <em>everyone</em> starts with a lot of resources...". Well, what if that were true?

Honestly, there's only one reason I want to be paid for my work: So that I can survive with decent living conditions. If everyone is paid a living income unconditionally, I won't have to find a way to extract money from my work. I can just dive into my work without worries.

No country-wide basic income has been implemented yet. But there has been some research on smaller-scale basic income programs. As far as I remember from what I've read, when people start getting a basic income, they generally do the same amount of paid work as they did before. But two kinds of people do significantly less paid work: child-rearers and artists. Child-rearers and artists both do very important work, they just aren't usually paid for it. Getting a basic income means they're not forced to split their labor with other jobs. This frees them up to do more of the important work they're doing.

"If you do something bad, you should be punished." That's something a lot of people believe. But it's much more complicated than that. In this post, I'm going to explore the morality of punishment.

Since I'm going to be talking about morals, let me be precise about my terms. If I say an action is <strong>good</strong>, I mean it ultimately causes more good than harm. <strong>Bad</strong> means it ultimately causes more harm than good.<footnote((It should really be the morality of a <em>choice</em>, relative to your other possible choices. In this post, I happen to just be talking about "do an action vs. just don't do the action" scenarios.))> For clarity, I'll try to avoid using other meanings of those words. Also, <strong>punishment</strong> can include any action intended to punish. Prison, social censure, physical violence, "time-outs" &ndash; anything. Each have their own issues, but some things are common to all of them.

<h2>Costs and benefits of punishment</h2>

Punishment is inherently a form of harm, so it's always bad unless it also causes more good. I think of this as a <strong>moral cost</strong>. You don't want to pay the moral cost unless you get a big enough moral benefit. So what are <cut>some possible benefits of punishment?

<ul class="big_list">
<li><strong>Deterrent effect</strong>: Theoretically, if you punish people for doing something, they'll do it less often. However, this has some <em>big</em> exceptions. If it's something people do out of desperation, they will risk the punishment anyway. If it's something people do accidentally, they might not be skilled enough to avoid doing it. And the punishment can even <em>encourage</em> the action, the way banned books get more popular.

<br><br>If I remember right, in children, the research says that says punishment is only effective if it's both prompt and reliable. If it isn't, you just pay the moral cost <em>without</em> gaining the benefit. (Of course, even if it is, the cost might still <em>outweigh</em> the benefit.)

<br><br>Interestingly, this effect isn't necessarily based on how much you <em>actually</em> punish people. Instead, it's based on how much people <em>believe</em> you're punishing people. Social norms and beliefs can end up being more important than the actual action and punishment. I suppose that means, when punishment is actually good, it's also good to <em>publicize</em> the punishment as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Discouraging revenge</strong>: If someone is hurt, they might seek revenge on the person who hurt them. However, if they feel the person has <em>already been sufficiently punished</em>, they might be content enough to go home. If the punishment is less harmful than the revenge would have been, this ends up being a good effect.

<br><br>Notice that this benefit only depends on the victim <em>thinking</em> they know who hurt them. But they can sometimes be wrong. That implies that it might be good for you to punish someone even if <em>you</em> know that person didn't hurt anyone. Punishing an innocent person can even have a deterrent effect, if others believe that the innocent person actually did the thing. Do these things make you uncomfortable?</li>
</ul>

On the other hand, punishment can also have other bad effects, even besides the direct harm:

<ul class="big_list">
<li><strong>Prevention of trust</strong>: Suppose you know someone who has a bad habit of punching people. There's a lot of different ways you could try to solve this problem. You could ask zem: What makes you feel like punching people? Can you think of another way you could deal with your feelings? Do you understand how it might hurt the other person? If ze thinks about these questions sincerely, ze might end up changing for the better.

<br><br>But if you're known for punishing people, ze probably won't think about the questions sincerely. Ze'll just give the answers ze thinks will make you least likely to punish zem. When you use punishment as a solution, you actually <em>give up</em> the opportunity to use other solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Becoming an authority</strong>: If you demonstrate the power to punish people, you become an authority figure. This can theoretically be good, if it stops a worse person from becoming an authority first. But most people don't know how to use authority responsibly. You might end up using your authority to benefit yourself at other people's expense. This can even happen without you realizing it. For instance, people might make sacrifices to get your approval, without you knowing it was only to get your approval.

<br><br>When you punish someone, even if that <em>specific</em> punishment was good, it increases the chance that you might harm someone else using your authority in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example scenarios</h2>

Because of the many downsides of punishment, here's a category we can think about: <strong>Actions that are bad, but where punishing them is also bad.</strong>

I happen to think that <em>almost all</em> bad actions are in this category. Other people might think it's not as many. But here's an example that I think most people can agree on: Parents leaving young children unattended for ten minutes.

This action is undoubtedly <em>bad</em> &ndash; young children can get themselves seriously hurt if they are not taken care of. But <em>punishing</em> parents for it is also undoubtedly bad. It's inevitable that a parent will eventually get distracted or make a mistake. Such a punishment has no deterrent effect. Worse, the stress of worrying about being punished uses up parents' mental energy. This makes them <em>more</em> likely to accidentally harm their children in the future.

Here's another example. Suppose there's someone who often abuses you. One day, you decide to fight back. However, you lose the fight and the abuser retaliates by hurting both you and other people.

Your action is technically <em>bad</em> &ndash; if you hadn't done it, fewer people would've been hurt. However, it's ridiculous to punish someone for fighting back against an abuser. If we're trying to solve the problem of people being hurt by abuse, all our energy should be directed towards changing the actions of the <em>abuser</em>. In fact, we probably shouldn't even <em>criticize</em> someone for fighting back in a destructive way. Even by pointing it out at all, we risk putting too much emphasis on their actions, when the problem can only be solved by changing the abuser's actions.

So we can actually break things down into more categories:

<ul>
<li><strong>Actions that are bad to do, but also bad to criticize.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Actions that are good to criticize, but bad to punish.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Actions that are good to punish.</strong></li>
</ul>

Obviously, this is still too simple &ndash; for instance, an action might be good to criticize in one way, but not in another. But I've found it helpful to think using these categories. It helps remind me not to automatically jump up and criticize someone, even if I think their action is bad.

<p>(Content warning: physical violence used as a metaphor.)</p>

I don't want my writing to be memorable like a beautiful sunset. I want it to be memorable like being stabbed in the face.

I want not pleasure, but awe. Not the beautiful, but the sublime. Not "that was cool", but "holy shit!" I want my work to change you. I want to show you something you've never seen before. Something that shakes the foundations of your beliefs. I want to take what you thought was simple, and make it seem bizarre. I want to take what you thought was bizarre, and make it seem simple. I want to show you the truth hidden in plain sight.

If someone says to me, "I liked your story", that's nice, but it's not what I'm after. I want to hear "I never saw things that way before". Or "That was fascinating". Or "I'm still processing it". Or "I didn't think that was possible". Or "I can't believe I didn't realize that before". Or "I'm going to remember that next time I..." Or even "What the fuck did I just read?"

When you tell your friends about it, I don't want to make you say "You should read Eli's book. It's a high-quality piece of literature." I want to make you trip over yourself trying to retell the whole story, because you have no other words to express what you've just experienced. I don't want to be <em>like</em> some other famous story. I want to <em>become</em> a point of reference that you use to explain the rest of your world.

Only after I have changed human nature &ndash; that is when I will have mastered my craft of writing.
