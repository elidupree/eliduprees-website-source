Joe tells a disparaging joke, and a few people laugh. Candace replies "That's not funny!" Joe counters, "Yes it is. Look, someone laughed at it."

Joe may be technically correct. The joke was well-crafted and made people laugh. But that's not what Candace meant. What really happened here?

Really, Candace just wants people not to say disparaging things. In some other world, the conversation might go like this: Candace says "Don't say that. It's disparaging." Then Joe says "What? It's just a joke!"

Many people believe that something can be "just a joke", making it less bad. But a disparaging joke is actually <em>worse</em> than a disparaging statement. First, a joke is enjoyable, encouraging people to repeat it. Someone might go to all their friends, saying "I just heard this great joke!", but it's much less common for someone to run around saying "I just heard this great disparaging statement!". Second, the joke makes people let down their guard. People may simply laugh and absorb the joke, without stopping to think whether it's right or wrong. For both these reasons, the better a joke is (in technical joke-craft), the <em>more</em> damage it can do from a moral perspective.

I'll put it this way: the funnier a joke is, the more <strong>joke power</strong> it has. Other things <cut>can also affect joke power. The more people are heard laughing at a joke, the more powerful it becomes. (That's why a lot of comedy shows have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track">laugh tracks</a>.) And the more popular the person telling the joke is, the more powerful it is. Like all forms of power, joke power can be used either for good or for evil.

When Candace said "That's not funny!", it wasn't <em>wrong</em>, because it wasn't a statement of <em>fact</em>. It didn't mean "That joke does not cause anyone to be amused." Instead, it was a statement of what <em>should</em> be: "Let's all refuse to laugh at that joke." By refusing to laugh, we can reduce the power of the joke and discourage the joker from telling that kind of joke in the future.

"That's not funny" isn't the only technique for this, of course. Maybe you say "That's not okay" or "That's not cool". Maybe you calmly ask the joker to explain the joke, which can make them uncomfortable by forcing them to think about the actual meaning of the joke. Maybe you have some authority you can use: "Hey. No telling racist jokes in my club." Different strategies work in different circumstances.

But in any case, don't think, "That joke was disparaging, but it was funny." Think instead, "That joke was disparaging, <em>and worse</em>, it was funny &ndash; so it's extra important to strike back against it."

I've been sort of sick for a few days, so I'm not up to writing a serious blog post. So instead, I'll take this time to give an update on what I've been doing recently.

<h2>My hands</h2>

In <a href="/blog/eli-status-august-2016">my last status update</a>, I mentioned that my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adductor_pollicis">adductor pollicis</a> hadn't been doing its job. Since then, we've discovered that the same thing happened with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_interossei_of_the_hand">first dorsal interosseous muscle</a>, which also helps the thumb move. Training that muscle has given me another big improvement in how well my hands work. A couple weeks ago, I actually drew for 30 minutes straight, which was manageable (although close to my limit at the time). They're not feeling quite as good now, but they are normally worse when I'm sick, so they may still be improving overall.

<h2>My projects</h2>

Writing <a href="/stories/the-23-days-cult">The 23 Days Cult</a> turned out to be a much bigger project than I had planned for. It left me pretty burnt out, and I didn't manage to get excited about another project for the month after that. I did manage to do some work on a game modding thing in Wesnoth, which is fun, but it's not one of the Great Works Of Elidupree.com. I also randomly learned how to livestream games on Twitch. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/EliDupree">Here's my Twitch page, if you're interested in that kind of thing.</a>

But yesterday I think I finally got excited about something again &ndash; continuing work on <a href="/hexy">[NSFW] Hexy Bondage</a>. I actually made a couple changes to the rules, more than a year ago, but I never published the changes, because my original publishing process was INCREDIBLY inconvenient. So first I was thinking of improving the publishing process. But now I'm also hoping to make an online version of the game, which you could play on a computer or smartphone or whatever. I'm not sure if I'll stick to this project &ndash; we'll have to see how I feel when I'm not so sick. But I'm pretty excited about it so far.

"title": "Whoops, we are violating people's freedom of speech all the time",
"tags": ["philosophical"],

"blurb": "It's not enough to say “I will never punish any speech”.",
"contents":'''

"Freedom of speech" can mean a lot of different things, but mostly boils down to this: <em>Don't punish people for what they say</em>. Different people have different reasons for thinking this is important. Here are a few perspectives:

<ol type="A">
<li>People benefit individually from saying what they want to.</li>
<li>Society as a whole benefits from people saying what they want to.</li>
<li>Punishment causes material harm to people (regardless of whether there's a justification for it).</li>
</ol>

For C, the size of the punishment is important. Killing someone for denouncing the tyrant is much worse than yelling at someone for denouncing the tyrant. But for A and B, the only thing that matters is <em>what speech actually happened</em>. If 10 people stay quiet because they're afraid of being yelled at, that has the <em>same</em> effect as 10 people staying quiet because they're afraid of being killed, or 10 people having their messages blocked by official censorship. This will be important later.

<h2>Here's one way we screw it up</h2>

Consider these two scenarios:

Scenario #1: If you're caught denouncing the tyrant, the tyrant's soldiers will throw you in a hole until you starve.

Scenario #2: You are already in a hole. The tyrant's soldiers don't care what you say. A few people are willing to feed you, but only in exchange for you consistently praising the tyrant.

Do you have more freedom of speech in scenario #2? Of course not. For <cut>perspectives A and B, the incentive for you to stay quiet is the same. For perspective C, the material harm to you is also the same, or worse. The only difference is that there's not such an obvious "bad guy".

Scenario #2 is the <em>de facto</em> state of freedom-of-speech in a lot of the United States. Even in my middle-class community, a lot of people change how they talk online because they're afraid of losing their jobs. And I've heard that it's much worse among working-class people, who have less job security and less ability to bring lawsuits if their bosses fire them illegally.

In our current system, most people have to sell their labor in order to survive. And for many people, it won't be easy to find a new job if they lose their current one. As long as these two things are true, the threat of losing your job is in the same general category as the threat of being beaten up or put in prison. Your freedom of speech is only as strong as your social safety net.

If you're interested in protecting freedom of speech, creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">universal basic income</a> might be the most effective policy.

<h2>Another situation</h2>

Again, two scenarios:

Scenario #3: I run an online community. Joe the sexist troll says rude things to the female members whenever they say anything. As a result, many of the female members hesitate to speak up, and a lot of them leave.

Scenario #4: I ban Joe from the community. Everyone else is fine.

In scenario #4, I did technically <em>punish somebody for what they said</em>. But as a result, more people found the opportunity to say what they wanted to. Thus, under perspectives A and B, there was <em>more total freedom of speech</em>. There's a small trade-off &ndash; I don't <em>intrinsically</em> want to stop Joe from having fun, but stopping Joe from having fun accomplishes a greater good for other people.

If you're deciding policy for a group, and you want to make sure that the group members can speak freely, it's not enough to say "I will never punish any speech". You have to consider what problems might discourage the members from speaking. If you have harassers in your group, what are you going to do about them? If some members have more resources or influence than others, how do you make sure they don't control the conversation? If you've misused your own authority in the past, how do you assure people that they're safe speaking in front of you this time?
