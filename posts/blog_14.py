Joe tells a disparaging joke, and a few people laugh. Candace replies "That's not funny!" Joe counters, "Yes it is. Look, someone laughed at it."

Joe may be technically correct. The joke was well-crafted and made people laugh. But that's not what Candace meant. What really happened here?

Really, Candace just wants people not to say disparaging things. In some other world, the conversation might go like this: Candace says "Don't say that. It's disparaging." Then Joe says "What? It's just a joke!"

Many people believe that something can be "just a joke", making it less bad. But a disparaging joke is actually <em>worse</em> than a disparaging statement. First, a joke is enjoyable, encouraging people to repeat it. Someone might go to all their friends, saying "I just heard this great joke!", but it's much less common for someone to run around saying "I just heard this great disparaging statement!". Second, the joke makes people let down their guard. People may simply laugh and absorb the joke, without stopping to think whether it's right or wrong. For both these reasons, the better a joke is (in technical joke-craft), the <em>more</em> damage it can do from a moral perspective.

I'll put it this way: the funnier a joke is, the more <strong>joke power</strong> it has. Other things <cut>can also affect joke power. The more people are heard laughing at a joke, the more powerful it becomes. (That's why a lot of comedy shows have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track">laugh tracks</a>.) And the more popular the person telling the joke is, the more powerful it is. Like all forms of power, joke power can be used either for good or for evil.

When Candace said "That's not funny!", it wasn't <em>wrong</em>, because it wasn't a statement of <em>fact</em>. It didn't mean "That joke does not cause anyone to be amused." Instead, it was a statement of what <em>should</em> be: "Let's all refuse to laugh at that joke." By refusing to laugh, we can reduce the power of the joke and discourage the joker from telling that kind of joke in the future.

"That's not funny" isn't the only technique for this, of course. Maybe you say "That's not okay" or "That's not cool". Maybe you calmly ask the joker to explain the joke, which can make them uncomfortable by forcing them to think about the actual meaning of the joke. Maybe you have some authority you can use: "Hey. No telling racist jokes in my club." Different strategies work in different circumstances.

But in any case, don't think, "That joke was disparaging, but it was funny." Think instead, "That joke was disparaging, <em>and worse</em>, it was funny &ndash; so it's extra important to strike back against it."

I've been sort of sick for a few days, so I'm not up to writing a serious blog post. So instead, I'll take this time to give an update on what I've been doing recently.

<h2>My hands</h2>

In <a href="/blog/eli-status-august-2016">my last status update</a>, I mentioned that my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adductor_pollicis">adductor pollicis</a> hadn't been doing its job. Since then, we've discovered that the same thing happened with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_interossei_of_the_hand">first dorsal interosseous muscle</a>, which also helps the thumb move. Training that muscle has given me another big improvement in how well my hands work. A couple weeks ago, I actually drew for 30 minutes straight, which was manageable (although close to my limit at the time). They're not feeling quite as good now, but they are normally worse when I'm sick, so they may still be improving overall.

<h2>My projects</h2>

Writing <a href="/stories/the-23-days-cult">The 23 Days Cult</a> turned out to be a much bigger project than I had planned for. It left me pretty burnt out, and I didn't manage to get excited about another project for the month after that. I did manage to do some work on a game modding thing in Wesnoth, which is fun, but it's not one of the Great Works Of Elidupree.com. I also randomly learned how to livestream games on Twitch. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/EliDupree">Here's my Twitch page, if you're interested in that kind of thing.</a>

But yesterday I think I finally got excited about something again &ndash; continuing work on <a href="/hexy">[NSFW] Hexy Bondage</a>. I actually made a couple changes to the rules, more than a year ago, but I never published the changes, because my original publishing process was INCREDIBLY inconvenient. So first I was thinking of improving the publishing process. But now I'm also hoping to make an online version of the game, which you could play on a computer or smartphone or whatever. I'm not sure if I'll stick to this project &ndash; we'll have to see how I feel when I'm not so sick. But I'm pretty excited about it so far.
