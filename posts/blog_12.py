Here's a story you've probably heard before:

The heroes stumble upon someone who has been magically imprisoned. Maybe it's a thousand-year-old spirit, maybe it's a regular person. Maybe it begs them to free it. Maybe they free it by accident. Maybe this is a game where you can choose whether to free it. Either way, freeing it is <strong>bad</strong>. If it eventually gets free, then it turns out to be evil. The heroes may have to spend the rest of the story fighting it.

I've seen a lot of different stories that follow this pattern. On the other hand, I can hardly think of any stories with an imprisoned <em>good</em> being. The main exception is when there's a good counterpart to an imprisoned evil being in the same story. These stories seem to encourage the belief that "if someone is being punished, they must have done something to deserve it", which is generally a bad thing to believe.

I'd like to change this pattern. I live in the United States, which injustly imprisons huge numbers of people. Because imprisoning people is generally bad in real life, I would like to make it look bad in my stories as well.

<h2>Story idea #1</h2>

Legend says that in ancient times, there was a battle between a great good spirit and a great <cut>evil spirit. In the end, the good spirit overcame the evil spirit and imprisoned it for one thousand years.

Now, the good spirit still rules over the world, but the thousand years are almost over. The good spirit has sent a group of human heroes to perform a magical ritual around the prison, which will keep the evil spirit imprisoned for another thousand years. However, one of these heroes &ndash; the main character &ndash; starts to have doubts. Ze studies in ancient libraries, trying to find out the true history of the two spirits. The more ze reads, the less sure ze is that the imprisoned spirit is really evil. So when the time comes to perform the ritual, ze does it wrong on purpose. The spirit breaks free.

It turns out that the imprisoned spirit was actually the <em>good</em> spirit from the legends. The real winner was the evil spirit, who locked the good spirit away and promptly ruined the world. But after ruling the world as a blatantly evil monster for decades, it eventually started to get bored. It wasn't having any fun trying to cause more suffering in a world that was already terrible. So it began to repair the world. As it did, it rewrote history, claiming that it was the good spirit all along and the other one was evil.

When the good spirit gets free, the formerly-evil spirit is enraged. It starts getting ready for another battle. But it isn't the monster it used to be. The good spirit offers it mercy, and it agrees to work together with the good spirit, to make a better world for everybody.

<h2>Story idea #2</h2>

Freeing a prisoner is good, as far as it goes. But what about reparations?

Our heroes find a very angry spirit imprisoned in the woods. It tells them a story about long ago, when it had a fight with some local humans. Neither side was entirely good or entirely evil. But the humans won the fight, so they were able to lock the spirit away.

Now, the spirit is legitimately angry at having been trapped for so long. It rages at humans, saying that they are all greedy and heartless. It demands that the heroes free it, and promises that once it is free, it will wreak great revenge on the nearby human settlements.

The heroes aren't sure what to do. On the one hand, they empathize with the spirit, so they don't want to keep it trapped and suffering. On the other hand, they can't justify letting it get free, if it is going to cause greater evil.

So the heroes decide to show the spirit that humans are <em>not</em> always greedy and heartless. They travel to all the nearby towns. They convince the people to pay reparations to the spirit, and help it build a new home for itself. When the heroes return to the spirit, offering to free it AND pay reparations, it relents. It realizes that humans can be good, and gives up its revenge.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

I like story idea #2 because it respects the spirit's rights even though the spirit is violently angry. In real life, some people try to justify ignoring other people's rights just by pointing out that they protested in a violent way. Violent protest is not necessarily <em>good</em>, but it doesn't change the fact that they deserve their rights. If you don't like it when people protest violently, it is better to treat them well so that they don't have to protest at all, rather than to blame them for how they respond to their treatment.

That said, I'm not really inspired to write either story. Both the story ideas start with the <em>illusion</em> of the original "evil spirit" story. That could be good, because it tells the story of someone who has bad assumptions, but then learns to get past them. But it could also be bad, because it kind of repeats the original bad story for a while, even though it has a different ending.

If I include this concept in my actual writing, I think I'd rather just do it in a straightforward way. That is, there would be an injustly imprisoned non-evil being, and the heroes would release it. It wouldn't look evil first. Of course, that idea is so straightforward that it doesn't form a complete story. It would just be an element in a larger story. Maybe this element will find its way into one of my big future story plans...

Suppose a genie appeared and offered to save the lives of 100 white people, and also save the lives of 5 black people. Should you accept? Of course you should.

That's a critique I've heard a few times. It says: "Equality has no inherent value. What really matters is doing as much good as you can, for as many people as you can." I can't <em>completely</em> disagree with that &ndash; it was even one of the assumptions in my <a href="/blog/game-theory-contracts-altruism">mathematical model</a>. But it's much more complicated than that.

At worst, the genie example proves that equality isn't an <strong>end in itself</strong>. Increasing equality might still <strong>cause</strong> good things to happen. In philosophy terms, it doesn't have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(ethics)">intrinsic value</a>, it only has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_value">instrumental value</a>.

Usually, when I've seen other people use this argument, they've tried to twist it farther than that. They've implied: "Because equality doesn't have intrinsic value, we don't need to care about it at all." But there are many reasons to care about it. That's why I'm writing this post. In case you run into this argument somewhere yourself, let me prepare you with a defense:

<h2>The Defense</h2>

<h3>1. Equality as a rational incentive</h3>

Suppose my neighbor and I are gathering firewood. I want to get as much firewood as <cut>possible. I could go cut some myself, which is a lot of work. Or I could steal some from my neighbor, which is much easier.

Now, suppose that every evening, the village elder forces us to have equal amounts of firewood. If either of us has more firewood, the village elder <em>destroys</em> the extra wood. Are you mad at the elder? Is ze doing evil by destroying intrinsic value?

And yet, now I'm not going to steal anymore. If I steal, I'll just lose more than I gain. If I want to get more firewood, my logical action is to cut it myself and share it with my neighbor, too. And I no longer have to worry about my neighbor stealing from me, either. The fact that we can trust each other more easily has significant value.

This isn't perfect, of course. It only works on a small scale – if the group is too large, then you hardly get any reward from your individual labor. And it can often make the labor be split unequally. If we don't make some sort of agreement, whoever wants to maintain a 10% taller stack of firewood will end up doing 100% of the work. (If you've ever lived with someone who can tolerate more dirty dishes then you can, you probably have personal experience with this!)

However, that doesn't mean it's useless. Enforcing equality is a blunt instrument, but the good often outweighs the bad.

You could ask, "why doesn't the elder just ban stealing instead?" But there are many selfish behaviors that are more subtle. If it's harder to judge whether something was selfish, it's harder to ban it. And even in this case, the elder can't necessarily tell whether I stole or not. Ze might end up punishing someone who didn't steal, or failing to punish someone who did. Enforcement is much more effective (for both good <em>and</em> bad) if it is consistent.

<h3>2. Equality as a proof-of-concept</h3>

Is it possible for a person to walk along the street without ever being sexually harassed? Is it possible to walk into shops without being suspected as a thief? Is it possible ask your doctor about a medical problem and get advice that relates to that actual problem?

Of course it is. We know this because male people, white people, and thin cis people do these things all the time. If <em>everyone</em> got harassed, we wouldn't know that we could do anything about it. We might think it was an inevitable fact of life. But because it <em>doesn't</em> happen to some people, that proves that it's possible to prevent this evil.

When people say "I want to be treated equally", they hardly ever mean "I want you to make that other person's life just the terrible as mine". They mean, "I want the same good treatment that I <em>know</em> you give to other people".

Obviously, this doesn't apply to everything. If one person has 100 servants, that doesn't prove that everyone can have 100 servants.<footnote((Human servants, anyway. In a future robot utopia, many more things are possible.))> If there are limited resources, you can't give one person more without giving another person less. But there are many things, like harassment and abuse, which are probably <em>not</em> a matter of limited resources. We don't have to transfer them to someone else &ndash; we can just make them not happen at all.

<h3>3. Equality as efficient resource distribution</h3>

Which is more useful: To give three houses to someone who already has three houses, or to give one house to someone who has zero houses?

Most resources have <strong>diminishing returns</strong>. The more you have, the less useful it is to get one more. A person with $10 would gain a lot from finding $100, but a person with $1 billion would hardly be any better off if they got another million &ndash; they're rich either way. 

Therefore, if you're trying to hand out resources in the most efficient way, it's usually best to do it (approximately) equally. The more equality you use, the more value you produce. Equality still isn't technically an "intrinsic value", but it's hard to have a more direct relationship than that.

On the same subject, the genie from the example doesn't exist. There's never only one choice &ndash; there are always other options. If someone has the power to save 100 white people's lives, they could probably spend the same resources to save just as many black people's lives, if not more. Even if we don't say the genie's racial bias is inherently bad, we could still critique the genie for spending resources inefficiently.

<h3>4. Equality as friendship repair</h3>

Suppose your friend really really wanted a piano, but couldn't afford one. Now suppose that you could snap your fingers and make a piano appear out of thin air. Would you do it? Of course you would.

Rich people can do this. Not literally, but almost literally. Of course, if they do it too many times, they stop being rich. In order to stay rich, they need a justification for not doing this. That doesn't necessarily make them evil, but it does make it harder for them to be friends with poor people.

But you can't <em>just</em> avoid being friends with poor people. In many places, rich and poor live <em>physically</em> close to each other. They walk past each other every day, but if they really get to know each other, the rich people will have to face the question of why they hold onto their wealth when other people need it much more than they do. Not everyone responds to this in the same way, but few of the responses are good. Some people decide that the poor <em>deserve</em> their conditions. Some people refuse to <em>believe</em> that those conditions are as bad as they actually are. Some people build walls and fences so they don't have to look at the issue. One way or another, they have to distance themselves and suppress their empathy.<footnote((A side note about empathy: as I've mentioned before, empathy isn't inherently good. I myself don't usually feel empathy for other people, but that doesn't stop me from working for other people's good. But in my case, not feeling empathy is my <em>natural</em> state. If someone would naturally feel empathy for others, but suppresses it for a specific group of people, they probably won't learn how to treat the group well.))>

Similar things happen with other groups. White people have less empathy for black people. Male people find excuses to ignore female people's problems. On the other hand, in a world where everyone has equal power and resources (or at least much closer to equal), these things wouldn't have to happen. Because everyone would be in a more similar situation, they would have an easier time empathizing with each other.

Like everything else, this wouldn't be perfect. Even with equal <em>physical</em> resources, <a href="/blog/neurodiversity">people will still experience the world in very different ways</a>, so they won't always understand each other's situations. And there will always be reasons for people to mistreat each other, even if everyone has equal power.

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

Despite this defense, I still have some hesitation about the idea of equality. It's not a central part of my moral system. My reasons can be summed up in one sentence: Equality is not <strong>sufficient</strong> for justice. To reach a good world, we will have to fix the evils caused by inequality, but we will also have to do much more than that.

When people talk about equality, they are often aiming much lower. Let's say my goal is "LGBT equality". Maybe I want to end employment and housing discrimination against LGBT people. That would be a good thing. But is it good <em>enough</em>? Should we be content if LGBT homelessness is <em>only as common as</em> non-LGBT homelessness? It can be good to say, "let us achieve equality", but I am much more comfortable when someone says, "let us end the abuse completely".

Like a lot of people, I have an instinct to think "that's not fair" when people are treated unequally. "That's not fair" <em>can</em> be a useful way to think, as I argued above. However, it isn't always right. Many people think it's not "fair" to give extra accommodations for people's disabilities. And on the other hand, it <em>would</em> seem fair to apply an unjust law equally to everyone. My <em>own</em> sense of "fair" doesn't always agree with my sense of justice. Part of why I wrote this post was to try to reconcile those two things.

Anyway, I hope this post helps people think about things. I'm not trying to argue that "equality is good" or "equality is bad" &ndash; it's much nicer to understand <em>how</em> it can be good and bad.

Here's a quick update on how things are going for me right now.

<h2>My hands</h2>

I've been having various problems with using my thumbs for years, since I injured them through overuse. However, 6 weeks ago, I finally figured out the cause of most of my current issues. It seems that my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adductor_pollicis">adductor pollicis</a> was going completely unused (in both hands). That meant my other hand muscles had to do extra work to compensate.

For the last 6 weeks, I've been deliberately exercising the adductor pollicis, and my problems have gotten MUCH better. If I'm lucky, I'll be able to draw again within <cut>a month or so – then I can FINALLY finish my comics. That said, there have been a lot of times when my hands have seemed to get better, then got worse again. So there are no guarantees. I still have some upcoming doctor's appointments to investigate other possible causes of the problems.

<h2>My voice</h2>

Currently, I do most of my work using speech-to-text software, which means I have to use my voice a lot. This is mostly fine, but my throat sometimes gets irritated. I've been having some long-term throat problems, which I think are seasonal allergies. I'm taking antihistamines to help with that, and it's allowing me to use my voice <em>almost</em> as much as I want to. But it sometimes randomly gets better or worse on its own.

<h2>My projects!</h2>

I'm currently working on a HUGE programming project. It's kind of hard to explain what it is, but it's a game/simulation backend thing. It'll make it easier for me to write games in the future, and I'm especially designing it to help build Lasercake. It's called the TimeSteward because it lets you mess around with things back in time, like in <a href="/games/green-caves">the green caves game</a>.

If you're a programmer, you can <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/time-steward">check out the TimeSteward on GitHub</a>. It's very incomplete, but there's already a working example with some circles bouncing around. It looks kind of like this, except with bouncing:

<img alt="A screenshot of the example; 20 red circles on a black background" src="/media/bouncy-circles-screenshot.png?rr"/>

I've been on a roll working on this. It's occupying my attention enough that I can't concentrate on any other projects on the side. That's why I only posted a blog post last week. I'm still sitting on some previously-unpublished stories that I want to edit and release, but that will have to wait until the TimeSteward isn't using up all my energy.

"title": "Consenting in Advance",
"tags": ["sex"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "When I talk about sexual consent, people sometimes say something like this:",
"contents":'''
When I talk about sexual consent, people sometimes say something like this:

"But it's sexy to just do things in the moment and go with the flow! If I stopped to talk about consent, it would kill the mood."

Before I go on, I should say this: There are a lot of different sexy things. If we have to sacrifice a few sexy things in order to avoid accidentally abusing people, we should certainly sacrifice them.

However, we mostly <em>don't</em> have to sacrifice this one. All you have to do is talk about it <em>before</em> you end up being "in the moment".

That's what I do. When I start doing things with a new partner, we obviously have a conversation about what each of us likes. That includes some things that each of us is okay with the other doing to them <em>without</em> asking every time. It's sort of like setting up ground rules, so we know which things could be a problem and which things we don't need to worry about.

As part of the conversation, you might say something like <cut>this:

"I'm really excited by the idea of you just coming up to me and groping me without warning. So... yeah, you can do that whenever you feel like it. I mean, not when I'm in the middle of working on something. But when we're only chilling out, that would be great."

Or like this:

"Yes, I AM really into biting! Whenever we're having sex, go for it. Although, I can't have the marks be visible at my work, and the uniform is really strict, so &ndash;"

Or like this:

"It's not that I don't <em>want</em> to have sex with you &ndash; I do want to, it's really tempting, but I know that I always feel awful after having sex unless I've been intimate with the person for a lot longer. So I don't want to do that for now. But, when we're making out, it could still be fun for you to feel me up a lot more &ndash; you could even pull my clothes off and go at it naked, just as long as you don't expect it to lead to something else."

That last one could take a lot of trust. There are a lot of people who WOULD take naked make-outs as an excuse to pressure someone into sex. Because of that, other people might not be willing to admit that they want it. But if you do a good job of practicing consent, your partner may learn that it <em>is</em> safe to trust you. Then both of you will get to do things that you otherwise couldn't.

<h2>Renegotiating</h2>

The ground rules you choose won't always be perfect. Sometimes you need to change them later. I used to have an arrangement where my partner could tickle me by surprise whenever they wanted to. But when my hand problem got worse, I started worrying that I would hurt my hands more when I squirmed around from being tickled. So we agreed that they would have to ask before doing that in the future.

Other times, something unexpected comes up while you're in the middle of doing stuff. Maybe you suddenly have an idea that you didn't discuss before. Or maybe somebody starts feeling bad about something they thought was okay for them. Then you have to pause the scene to renegotiate.

In BDSM terms, there's the idea of a "safeword" &ndash; a special word that means "I'm not just playing at protesting, I really need this to stop now". With my partners, we don't <em>just</em> use a safeword. When we need to make it clear that we're not just playing around, we say "out of character". So the safeword becomes "Out of character, that's too much." We can also use it the other way around: "Out of character &ndash; I'm just acting freaked out because it's fun to act freaked out. I can actually handle a lot more than this." Or if I'm not sure how my partner is feeling, I could say, "Out of character, are you still enjoying this?". With the "out of character" rule, the "me" who is having fun in the moment can stay separate from the "me" who is stepping back and being responsible.

<h2>"But I can tell whether they like it from their body language!"</h2>

Well, maybe. Reading people is a real skill, and some people are pretty good at it. But it's not completely reliable. If someone's from a different culture, or <a href="/blog/neurodiversity">thinks in a different way</a>, they might use body language differently than you expect. And your skills might <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">not be quite as accurate as you think they are</a>.

Let's say you're correct 95% of the time. That might sound pretty good. If you're telling jokes, and 95% of them are funny, you're pretty good joker. But if you're driving a car, and 95% of the time you don't run into anybody, you're a terrible driver and you shouldn't be on the road. Sexual things can be pretty high-stakes for people, so they're more like driving a car. You're <em>probably</em> right, but if you happen to be wrong, you could hurt someone a lot. If you like someone, you shouldn't take big risks with their feelings when you could just ask them and make sure.

<h2>"But..."</h2>

There's sometimes a darker side to the "but it would kill the mood" idea. Maybe you're relying on someone to be "in the mood" so that they'll agree to something they normally wouldn't. Maybe you're worried that they won't agree to have sex with you if they take a step back and think about it. It's not good to approach things this way. If you try to stop them from thinking about whether they really want to do it, you're taking a big risk that you'll hurt them.

If you're sitting there thinking "But that's me. I've done that", I'm not necessarily blaming you. We all do things that might hurt people. It's okay to admit that you didn't always do the right thing. The important thing is that you learn how you CAN avoid hurting people, then practice it.

Consent doesn't make everything perfect, but it's an important safety measure, and it can help build intimacy and trust. If I can help people practice consent in a way that works for them, I can be satisfied with a job well done.

"tags": ["story ideas", "writing"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "Our hero, an ace detective, gets called in to investigate a mysterious serial killer.",
"contents":'''

Our hero, an ace detective, gets called in to investigate a mysterious serial killer.

Apparently, the "Big Data Killer" strikes completely at random, all across the country. The only thing the cases have in common is this: The killer leaves behind a notebook listing all the metadata of the victim's recent communications. The notebook says who the victim called on the phone, how long they talked, what websites they visited recently, what search terms they searched for, and so on. The killer must be someone with access to some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">big data</a> database. It creates a picture of a terrifying surveillance state, seemingly assassinating people at random.

After many misadventures, our hero finally tracks the person down. But that's when the twist comes. The "killer" wasn't actually <em>killing</em> anyone at all. Ze was just a disillusioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_insurance">life insurance</a> executive. Zir company had used big data to accurately predict when its clients were going to attempt suicide, but didn't do anything about the suicides, because the insurance company didn't have to pay in the case of suicide. The "killer" had tried to work within the system to solve this, but failed. So ze decided to sabotage zir own company by altering scenes of suicide to make them <em>look</em> like murder!

<h2>Discussion</h2>

I think this gimmick is pretty funny. I'm not sure it justifies building a whole story around it, though. The message seems unnecessarily cynical. I don't think it's <em>bad</em> to be cynical about mass surveillance, but I'd rather write something that actually says what we can <em>do</em> about it.

I also think there's something exploitative about this idea, and detective stories about serial killers in general. The story is <em>about</em> a tragedy &ndash; a series of deaths. But the <em>story</em> isn't a tragedy &ndash; it's a spectacle, a tale of intrigue. The main character is the detective, who usually has nothing in common with the people who are actually suffering. In this particular case, it seems like completely the wrong way to approach the issue of suicide, as well.

I guess maybe you could make it work by making the <em>detective</em> have a personal relationship with suicide and surveillance as well.

As it is, though, I can't really use this idea. But it does make a good example of 90% of my creative process: "Coming up with clever ideas, but discarding them because they aren't quite right."
