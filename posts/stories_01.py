  "contents":'''<p>...in Plato's cave, watching the shadows. Outside, ze knew, there were people buying and selling. Capitalism saw them trading goods for goods, services for services. And oh, most beautiful of all, the exchange of goods for services, whereon the economy turns. What supplies! What demand! Capitalism blushed to think of it all.</p>

<p>And then zir chains were loosed. Ze turned, a breath half indrawn, barely daring to hope. Ze rushed out into the open air, eager to offer zir labor on the open market for a fair value.</p>

<p>Capitalism's name was Latisha Lopez. Capitalism didn't hear back from the first nine employers. Capitalism changed zir name to John Smith. Capitalism was hired as a professor of game theory. Capitalism was laid off so they could hire someone with a Ph.D. Capitalism tried a tutoring gig; people didn't like how ze dressed. Capitalism took off zir top hat and ribbons and tried again. Capitalism got a few jobs, but they didn't last long. Did they just pay me to take off my hat? ze asked zemself. Did they pay me to change my name? I wanted them to pay me to teach them...</p>

<p>Suddenly Capitalism saw it everywhere. It seemed no one was selling services. They sold whiteness, sold gender, sold fashion. They sold flattery and the image of success. They sold access to their personal lives. They sold evidence of lifelong conformism. An employer wanted to see Capitalism's facebook profile, but Capitalism didn't have one. So Capitalism went on the Internet and saw the ads. Capitalism knew there would be ads for goods and services. But the ads weren't selling goods or services. They sold false authority, sold romance, sold titillation. They sold smug half-truths and comfortable lies. They sold sexual violence and racial hatred and progressive ideals.</p>

<p>These people are so stupid! cried Capitalism in vain. They don't understand the truth about the exchange of value! But no one heard zem. Maybe only the common people are so wrong, ze thought. Surely if someone gets ahead in the world, they must be smart enough to understand. So Capitalism went to the stock market. Ze peeked in the mighty doors and watched in awe as the numbers flew past. Here they bought ignorance and sold promises, bought hopes and sold tragedy, bought politicians and sold souls. Capitalism strode up the golden hallway and demanded to see the greatest of all traders. The greatest of all traders was wheeled out. The greatest of all traders was a computer. Capitalism opened zir mouth, but before ze could speak one word, the computer had made $150 million buying vague knowledge and selling transient guesses. Capitalism hung zir head and slunk away in shame.</p>

<p>Capitalism didn't know who to trust. But Capitalism still had some hope left. Capitalism went and knocked on the door of Science. Why do people do such terrible things?! demanded Capitalism. Science told Capitalism to take a seat. Science told Capitalism about risk aversion. Science told Capitalism about unconscious racism. Science told Capitalism about cognitive dissonance. Science told Capitalism about the Milgram experiment. Just then the floor shook and a thunderous roar boomed out. Oh no, said Science. I left the door to the basement open. Science rushed to close the door, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Seven glowing eyes glared from the darkness and seven mandibles clicked loudly as the room filled with that destroyer of hopes, that deliverer of final answers, that child of formless gods whose names must never be spoken, Mathematics. Mathematics seized the two and pinned them to the ground. Mathematics turned its dreadful eyes on Capitalism and began to speak in a voice that grated the boundaries of zir sanity. Mathematics told Capitalism how enforcing contracts can decrease social welfare. Mathematics told Capitalism that markets aren't efficient unless P=NP. Mathematics told Capitalism that no uniformly applied non-aggression principle can prevent all game-theoretic situations where individual rational self-interest leads to a terrible result, with or without unlimited contract enforcement. Capitalism fainted dead away.</p>

<p>When Capitalism woke, Mathematics was nowhere in sight, so Capitalism tried to make a run for it. But Capitalism was in a police station. Mathematics was in the next cell over. The police had raided Science's house, and they were both being deported. Mathematics growled that you can't claim to be upholding a non-aggression principle based on your ownership of the land if the land was stolen from its traditional owners, but the police ignored Mathematics. The police put Capitalism on a bus and sent zem all the way back to Plato's cave where ze started. That didn't seem so bad. Capitalism never wanted to see Mathematics again.</p>

<p>But someone was waiting there in the cave. Who are you, asked Capitalism. The person said, I'm the one who broke your chains.</p>

<p>Capitalism stared in bewilderment. Why did you do that, said Capitalism. Did you hope to make a profit off my actions? Did you sell me out to the police? Did you bet money on my incomptence?</p>

<p>The person said, I did it because I believe everyone deserves a chance.</p>

<p>And Capitalism began to weep.</p>''',

"Remember the old GKS-20 game console?"

"Man, that takes me back. Everyone bought one because it was supposed to be the next great thing, but no studios released any regular games for it, just those weird minimalist things. Never knew why that happened. It was way ahead of its time, other than the tiny disk space. There's probably thousands of them still lying around in people's closets, with just the built-in games it shipped with."

"I know, right? But that's what I just learned today – it was never a legitimate console in the first place. Apparently it was a sting operation for illegal time travelers."

"You've got to be kidding me."

"No, I'm serious! Think about it. Let's say you're a game dev working away in 2060 – you're good, but hardly anyone's good enough to turn a profit in 2060 because the market is so competitive. You need something extra to get noticed. So you turn to time travel. And once you start thinking about it, the GKS-20 seems perfect – it was popular but it hardly had any games, so if you go back and release a game for it, it would get instant popularity. You'd make a pretty big mark on history – really get your name out there. But the moment you go back in time and actually negotiate for a GKS-20 release… Bam! Straight to jail."

"What about legitimate studios at the time? It can't have been a good sting if they had to sort through all the legitimate studios and just, what, reject them?"

"That's just the thing. The GKS-20 never had enough disk space to actually store a modern game – I mean modern at the time – assuming the game was written by a human. Anyone who was working at the time would've seen that and just given up, aside from the ones who made those minimalist games just to prove they could. But there's one way to make a game that can actually run on it – generate your game with 2050s-era AI, like using next-generation autoencoders and stuff. All the built-in games –"

"– were actually made by undercover cops from the future?"

"Exactly."

"I still think you're pulling my leg here. But, you know… I know JUST enough about how hard-core the time cops are that I wonder if they might actually run something like this."

"I'm not pulling your leg, I'm serious. Time cops don't mess around."

"Man. They sure don't."

  "title":"It Was All A Dream",
  "blurb": "A Story Where There's A Time Loop And Then It All Goes Horribly Wrong",
  "authors_notes":'''

<p>I originally had the idea for this story months ago. I was thinking about how a lot of stories end by revealing that the whole first part was an illusion, or a metaphor, or ultimately meaningless or arbitrary. Or that all of the events had been manipulated by a villain beyond the scope of what the main characters could do anything about.</p>

<p>It generally doesn't make for a satisfying ending. But when I realized just how many <em>different</em> ways of doing this there were, I couldn't resist writing this parody.</p>

<p>As an unrelated note, the first time I said "robed skeleton", my speech-to-text software misheard it as "robot skeleton". That can be a headcanon if you want.</p>

I had just finished playing a good virtual-reality game when I got the call. 

It was from my friend Dave. "You've got to help me," he said, his voice breaking up from the poor reception. "I'm trapped in a time loop, I keep reliving this day over and over."

"Really?" I said. "If you've had this conversation before, then what number am I thinking of?"

"It's usually 68," he said nervously. By Jove, he was right. He went on to tell me a bunch of other stuff about my plans for the day that he couldn't possibly have known normally. That seemed pretty convincing. At first, I had wondered if I was somehow still in the virtual reality, but VR tech isn't good enough to read anyone's <em>mind</em> yet. So I agreed to meet up with him. He came by in his car, picked me up, and drove me to a weird-looking building.

"What is this place?" I asked.

"Secret government facility where the artifact that controls the time loop is hidden," Dave said. "We've snuck into it loads of times before. It'll be easy."

As soon as we snuck in the side door, it slammed behind us and a whole bunch of alarms started going off.

"What?!!" said Dave. "This isn't supposed to happen!"

"Uh, it'll be okay, right? With the time loop, you'll get another chance –"

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!" said Dave, panicked. "There's no time loop! It was a superintelligent AI! It threatened me, it told me exactly what to say to make you believe me! But now it's betrayed us, you have to –"

The next thing I knew, I was floating in the air, looking down at Dave's body… and my own body. A robed skeleton floated nearby.

"Am I dead?" I said.

<p><q><span class="reaper">Yes,</span></q> said the Reaper. <q><span class="reaper">You were killed by an automated security system,</span></q> it added helpfully.</p>

"Was it true? About the time loop? Or the AI?"

<p><q><span class="reaper">No,</span></q> said the Reaper.</p>

"Then how –"

<p><q><span class="reaper">Are you familiar with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mech—</span></q></p>

"Oh for cryin' out loud."

<p><q><span class="reaper">Every possible sequence of events happens in <em>some</em> universe. There <em>is</em> an evil AI in this universe, and it <em>did</em> manipulate you and your friend. But it's not superintelligent. It just thinks it is, because we happen to be in the one universe where all of its plans get lucky and succeed.</span></q></p>

"Oh."

<p><q><span class="reaper">But you needn't concern yourself with that.</span></q> The Reaper waved an arm, and a glowing portal appeared.</p>

The glowing light drew me in, flooding all my senses with warmth and peace. I blinked and found myself lying on my back, looking up into a beautiful garden. Standing over me were an elf, a dwarf, and a punk princess with a large axe.

"Am I dead for real now? Is this the afterlife?"

"What? Of course not! We just healed you!" exclaimed the punk princess.

"But what about the time loop and the superintelligent AI and the Reaper and the multiple universes and –"

They exchanged a look. "Last time we saw you, you were fighting in a wizards' duel with the sorcerer Cacomalbad. Cacomalbad must have defeated you, then used sorcery to erase your memories and replace them with some sort of nonsense."

"But it felt so real…" I muttered.

Just then, my alarm clock went off. Ugh.

I got up and brushed my teeth groggily. As I brushed, I tried to think back to all the weird stuff that had happened in my dream. Time loops? Evil sorcerers? Gadzooks, that was some weird dream.

Just kidding! I lied. I didn't even actually dream all that stuff, I just made it up.

Or, technically speaking, I didn't lie. I'm just a fictional character in a story. Since I don't exist, I didn't technically <em>do</em> anything at all. The author is the one who made it up.

Toodles!
