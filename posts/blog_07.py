<p>So, I was thinking about prose and graphic storytelling (comics). My thoughts might be hard to explain, so how about an example? Here's a line of prose:</p>

<p><q>I knocked. No answer. Let myself in anyway. Where was he?</q></p>

<p>I think pictures can normally communicate faster than words, but I tried to make that line the opposite on purpose: something that words can express more quickly. Let's look at how we might write that in pictures:</p>

<img src="/media/knocking.png?rr" alt="Image: Three panels. The first panel shows a person knocking at a door. The second shows zem waiting impatiently, thinking about the time. The third shows zem entering through the door, looking around. At the bottom left is a note that says 'Eli Dupree - 25 min sketch'"/>

<p> If we were going to print this in a book, those three panels might take up about a third of a page. The line of prose takes about, what, a twentieth of a page? Sure, you can read the pictures faster than you could read <em>a third of a page of text</em>, but that's not what we're comparing. The prose version gets the job done in a single line. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the prose glosses over a lot of details. The pictures show the style of the person's coat, zir attitude about <cut>being forced to wait, and a lot of other things. If I got the subtle body language right, the second panel tells us that it's chilly outside. So the pictures really tell us a lot more information, even if it takes up more space.</p>

<p>(The graphic narration also <em>doesn't</em> tell us the gender of the person the main character is seeking. To me, this is an <em>advantage</em> of graphic narration.)</p>

<p>We can also combine the two forms, like this:</p>

<img src="/media/knocking-combined.png?rr" alt="Image: The third panel of the first image, but with the prose line written in narration boxes: 'I knocked. No answer. Let myself in anyway' at the top, and 'Where was he?' at the bottom."/>

<p>That obviously gives all the information from the prose line. It also gives most of the information from the three panels above, and it does it in only one panel. It also has an interesting attribute: It <em>repeats</em> information. You don't need the text to tell you that the person is going through a door. With the text there, you don't need the <em>picture</em> to tell you that the person is going through a door. Either one does the job just as well.</p>

<p>In prose writing (and playwriting and screenwriting), I would normally say that redundancy is bad. You shouldn't explain something more than once, because after the first time, the reader is going to know what it says and be bored by it. And it's even worse in theatre and film, where the reader can't skim over dialogue ze doesn't need to hear.</p>

<p><em>But that isn't necessarily true in comics.</em> Saying the same thing twice is bad in prose, because in prose, everything you say is part of the <strong>narrative flow</strong>. The reader can't read two lines at once, so everything you write is going to take up some amount of the reader's time. That means you have to make every detail count.</p>

<p>Not so in comics, where the reader <em>can</em> see the whole picture at once. I mean, think about the silliest example: I drew the coat in every panel. After the first panel, you know the person is wearing a coat. If I was trying to eliminate all redundancy, I would <em>not draw the coat</em> in the later panels. But that's silly. The repetition of the coat is <em>good</em> redundancy, because it doesn't take the reader any extra time to see the coat in the later panels &ndash; in fact, it's actually <em>quicker</em> to glance over the same coat than to see something different.</p>

<p> So what's the real rule of redundancy? It's not "don't put any redundancy on the page". Instead, it is "don't put any redundancy in the <strong>narrative flow</strong>". If the reader will have to spend time reading it, don't repeat something they already know. But if they can glance past it, repetition helps the reader understand, so you should repeat yourself as much as possible! (Well, not if it prevents you from doing <em>other</em> cool stuff. But you probably get the idea.)</p>

<p>So, in short, graphic storytelling is a much more <em>condensed</em> format &ndash; you can say a lot more stuff without taking any more of the reader's time. So why doesn't everybody do it?</p>

<p>OH YEAH, BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY KIND OF HARD.</p>

<p>See the little note at the bottom of the three-panel image? "Eli Dupree - 25 min sketch"? It took me 25 minutes to draw that. And writing the prose line took about 25 seconds. Granted, I'm not very experienced at this right now, and I'll speed up with practice, and in any case it would be quicker to draw if it was an established character of mine rather than someone I had to invent on the spot. But anyway, the point is: Graphic stories are quicker to <em>read</em>, but they're much slower to <em>create</em>.</p>

<p>There's a reason I picked the phrase <em>condensed format</em>: In both prose and graphic storytelling, you start with the same set of cool ideas, but with graphic storytelling, you cram those ideas into a smaller package that the reader can consume more quickly and easily.</p>

<p>And that gets me to one of the really annoying questions about The Purpose Of Art. Because, like, I want to produce the best work possible. But I also want to <em>not</em> spend my whole lifetime on one piece. I could do a lot more than that if I just wrote things that weren't quite as good, but that I could write more quickly. What's the best compromise?</p>

<p>And that's a question that I don't have an answer to!</p>

<p>Incidentally, this post took about an hour to write, in addition to the sketching time.</p>

<p>So, I had my first classes today &ndash; a math class (Ordinary Differential Equations) and the first-year English Composition class. The math class was awesome. The English class wasn't.</p>

<p>Before I go on, let me make it clear that I'm not picking on this class or this professor in particular; I'll be naming specific things from this class, but I'm mainly doing that in order to talk about a general attitude about the study of English composition.</p>

<h2>Item 1: What Is Good Writing?</h2>

<p>First, the professor said that good prose was "a lot less subjective than you think". That's a laughable claim, for two reasons. First, it assumes <cut>that everyone in the class has the same thoughts about good prose being subjective. And that's a diversity issue. Among the students, there is probably a wide variety of different opinions on how subjective "good prose" really is, and the professor will never know those opinions, because ze didn't wait and ask people's opinions. Instead, ze told them what they thought &ndash; and in our society, what student would have spoken up to correct the professor? </p>

<p>Of course, the bigger point is that, well, "good prose" really <em>is</em> incredibly subjective.</p>

<p>But first, I'm going to jump back to the smaller point. Because I think the smaller point really <em>does</em> show why people might think that "good prose" isn't subjective. Because <em>if you believe that everybody thinks in the same way, then you will believe that the same prose is good for everyone</em>. And so it privileges one way of thinking over all the others. An attitude that privileges "normal" thinking is a form of neurelitism.</p>

<p>Now, let me tell you how subjective prose is!</p>

<p>But first, let me tell you why it makes any sense to talk about that in the first place. Because I actually have two options here: Either...</p><ol><li>I can decide that the phrase "good writing" doesn't actually mean anything.</li><li>I can decide that "good writing" <em>does</em> mean something, and then talk about what it means.</li></ol>

<p>I've heard a lot of people say things like "I don't know how to explain what good writing is, but I know it when I see it". There's nothing wrong with a person using that definition for zemself, but it makes it impossible to have a detailed discussion about good writing. Sometimes that's all you can do, because sometimes your ideas just aren't well-formed enough to talk about. But here, it'd be nice to have a definition we can work with.</p>

<p>Guess what? I <em>do</em> have a definition we can work with!</p>

<p>Definition: <em>Good writing is writing that is effective for some purpose.</em> Writing that someone enjoys is good writing. Writing that changes how someone thinks is good writing. If I'm trying to sell pizza, writing that convinces people to buy pizza is good writing, and so on.</p>

<p>There, I defined it! Now, is this subjective?</p>

<p>Heck yes! If I write a super formal essay to give to a nine-year-old history student, my audience will probably find it boring, and hence I will have failed as a writer. If I write an essay full of modern slang and show it to a college professor, it'll probably be outside the professor's comfort zone, and hence I will have failed as a writer. And if I write an essay that's super formal when my audience is people who use modern slang all the time, it'll be less familiar to them, so the essay full of slang <em>would have been a better essay,</em> and it would have been better <em>in a very important way.</em></p>

<p>The institution of Prestigious-University-English doesn't agree with me. It thinks that there's one specific style of English that's more important than the others. And that's bad, because when you privilege one style of English over the others, you also privilege one group of people over the others. If "grammatically correct" English is the dominant form of the language used, that marginalizes anyone who can't (or won't) read that style easily. It's sort of like going to a bilingual community and saying that English is correct and Spanish is incorrect. Sure, an English class is going to teach English and not Spanish, and that's not a problem. But, if it teaches that "English is how you're supposed to write, and Spanish is unnecessary", then that <em>is</em> a problem. And that's exactly what the college is doing by requiring an English Composition (i.e. Formal English Composition) class, while not requiring an Informal English Composition class.<footnote((There are some things that are important in both formal and informal English, and we'll presumably be learning some of those things in this class, too. So far, though, it's only been about the formal stuff.))></p>

<h2>Item 2: What are the rules, and why?</h2>

<p>My English professor has an opinion about what the rules of English grammar are. I happen to disagree with zem on a variety of points.</p>

<p>One, there's no such thing as formal rules of English grammar. The meaning of language is defined by how people use it and how people understand it. It's not defined by how someone <em>else</em> says it's supposed to be used or understood. General guidelines help people understand each other, but when it comes to hard-and-fast rules, there just aren't any. Trying to assign rules is called <strong>prescriptivism</strong>, because you're <em>prescribing</em> what the rules should be, rather than watching how they develop on their own. Saying what the rules/guidelines <em>seem to be</em>, by observing how the language is actually used, is called <strong>descriptivism</strong>. I am a descriptivist, and I dislike prescriptivism (as you've probably figured out already!).</p>

<p>Take this blog, for instance. It's full of grammatical "errors". Of course, they're not actually errors, since most of them are intentional. Some of them are just me being casual, like when I begin a sentence with "So, ...". Those ones are <em>informal</em> grammar, not incorrect grammar. How do I know it's correct? Simple: Because that's how people use it, and usage defines the rules!</p>

<p>Some of my other "errors" are there for bigger reasons. For instance, I bet most English professors wouldn't consider "ze" to be proper English. Or they think that you should always put punctuation <em>inside</em> a quotation mark. That's "grammatically correct", but logically incorrect, because <em>you're not quoting the punctuation and so logically it shouldn't be inside the quote marks.</em> That's kind of obvious. The only reason to do it the other way is because the other way is conventional. I don't mind if other people follow the convention, but I don't see any real reason for following it, since doing it this way is just as easy to understand.</p>

<p>That makes me a <strong>revisionist</strong> &ndash; I don't just observe the evolution of language and try to copy it, I intentionally push the language to evolve, by using words and grammar that I think make the language work better. English is hardly a perfect language. If you're not willing to change the language, the language will limit what you can say. When we add words and phrases like "ze", "lateral thinking", "lol", and so forth (just to give a few recent inventions), we're not commiting <em>errors that make bad writing</em> &ndash; we're improving the language, making our writting <em>better</em> than ever before!</p>

<p>My professor gave the usual line of "You need to know the rules in order to break them... Great writers know the rules, and they sometimes break the rules, but they do it for a reason". This statement has <em>some</em> merit; after all, most of the "rules of grammar" are actually good ideas, and I think it's useful to follow most of them. (The thing I don't agree with is if someone tries to <em>enforce</em> the rules). On the other hand, it just isn't true as a fact. A lot of historical "great writers" didn't respect, and sometimes didn't even <em>know</em>, the "rules". Here's a quote from Joan Didion, whom lots of English-professor-type people consider a great writer:</p>

<blockquote>Grammar is a piano I play by ear, since I seem to have been out of school the year the rules were mentioned. All I know about grammar is its infinite power.</blockquote>

<p>This quote is wonderful! (And I also happen to think that Joan Didion's writing is great in general.) Because that's the way grammar really works &ndash; I mean, I'm an abstract mathematician, and I love formalizing things, but even <em>I</em> don't read text in a purely formal way. People read text in an intuitive way, and so the way to be really good at constructing sentences is to be really good at that intuition. And there are lots of different ways to learn that intuition. Some people can learn it by studying and understanding formal rules, but other people learn it by immersing themself in the everyday use of the language. Nobody becomes fluent in a foreign language by studying the formal rules, so why should we expect a person to become excellent in zir own language by doing that?</p>

<h2>Item 3: Where do we go from here?</h2>

<p>My professor gave a few examples of where you need to be able to write formal English: Applications for graduate school. Job applications. College classes (which give you grades, and grades basically only affect your applications to graduate schools and jobs).</p>

<p>You know what those have in common?</p>

<p><em>They're all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum games</a>.</em> If you get the scholarship, someone else loses the scholarship. If you get the job, someone else doesn't get the job. And most jobs don't actually require formal writing. Some public-relations jobs require writing, but that writing should be a lot less formal. Jobs in the sciences require a lot of writing, but &ndash; despite some overlap &ndash; science writing is very different than the "formal English" that they teach in English departments. In short &ndash; as I've been saying for this whole post &ndash; writing should be done <em>for a purpose</em>. And when you teach writing, you should teach how to best use the tools of writing to achieve a purpose, rather than teaching how to best fit within the mold given to you by centuries of prescriptivists.<footnote((Did you notice that this sentence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_infinitive">split two infinitives</a>? I hope you didn't, because noticing that would be distracting, which is bad, but it's also mainly your own fault for being oversensitive to innocent grammar. I happen to think that it works best the way I wrote it. Because if I un-split the infinitive, I get "how best to..." and that's hard to read, because people are familiar with seeing the phrase "how to", and the "best" confuses it. I didn't make that choice because I was conscious of the "don't split infinitives" rule and was breaking it for a reason; I did it because I was ignoring the rule, because the rule is pointless and stupid.))></p>

<p>This might be a little silly, but I'm going to use this blog as an example again. This blog is here to express ideas. I write this blog because I have lots of cool ideas and I want other people to benefit from them. Since I don't want to exclude anyone, I try to use the most neutral, accessible language that I can. Sometimes that's hard, because my ideas are complicated, and so I sometimes need to use complicated language. And sometimes I need to use a specific term, like "zero-sum game". (It's important to use that phrase because there's no other concise term for the concept.) And sometimes I just don't come up with the right way to say something, and I end up writing an awkward sentence instead. But the point is &ndash; when I fail, it's because I fail at my intended purpose. When I succeed, it's because I fulfilled my intended purpose.</p>

<p>Both of those things are <em>related</em> to the grammar and style that English classes teach, but the purpose must come first, and the style must come second.</p>

<p>Some moderately bad things happened, and I ended up dropping the English Composition class that I was taking. (I'm still considering what to replace it with &ndash; maybe another English Comp from a different professor, maybe another class entirely.) I'm not going to go into the details, but it was bad. So you might assume that I'd still be frustrated about it. But, I'm totally not! This post is about how I manage to not stay frustrated about things.</p>

<p>Now, you might be thinking "Aha! Eli probably has some sort of magical brain difference where ze just doesn't get frustrated in the first place!", which would be a good guess because <cut>my brain has lots of awesome powers, but no. A long time ago, I <em>did</em> have a tendency to get really frustrated by stuff, and now I don't, because I learned some new strategies. These strategies wouldn't work for everyone, but they work for me. </p>

<p>Let's take an example!</p>

<p>Case 1: Suppose there's a class that I have to take (probably a grade-school class, not a college class). And in the classroom, there is a buzzing insect. "BUZZ. BUZZ. I WILL ANNOY YOU AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE," says the insect. It makes me frustrated as all hell. I just wanted to take the class without an insect, but I'm stuck with the insect, which is horrible.</p>

<p>Case 2: Suppose there's a class that I can take if I want to, but don't have to take (probably a summer class that doesn't offer credit I need for anything). And I know there's an insect that hangs around in the room (pretend we can't get rid of it for some reason). But if I go to the class knowing there's an insect there, I'll be thinking "Okay, I know that thing is there, so I can deal with it."</p>

<p>See the difference here? In Case 1, I'm comparing "class without insect" to "class with insect", so I'm annoyed because I got the worse option. In Case 2, I'm comparing "no class" to "class with insect". If I go to class, I must have decided that "class with insect" was the <em>better</em> option. Since I decided that I was okay with not taking the class, I must logically be okay with taking the class with the insect, since it's better than something I already knew I was okay with.</p>

<p>I stopped being frustrated with things when I decided that I'm <em>never</em> in Case 1 and <em>always</em> in Case 2. I can always choose to leave the class.</p>

<p>What if I need the class to graduate? I can always choose not to graduate.</p>

<p>What if the law says I have to take the class? I can always choose to break the law. It has downsides, but it's <em>still an option on the table</em>. Because...</p>

<p>What if I need to do the frustrating thing in order to survive? <em>I can always choose not to survive.</em></p>

<p>So I ask myself, "Which would I prefer: To die, or to live?" And then I think "Given the ways of living available to me, I think I'd rather live. So let's figure out the best way to handle it."<footnote((Unfortunately, this might not work for you if some bits of your brain are yelling "No! I'd rather die!". Works for me, though; I've had suicidal thoughts in the past, but even then, most of the bits of my brain were good at cooperating with each other, so they could think clearly despite that.))> And dying is basically just nothing, and nothingness is a neutral thing, not a negative thing. Which implies that, since I choose to live, my life must be good. Not just "okay", but <em>good!</em></p>

<p>I'm glad my life is good, and I wish more people had good lives!<footnote((Note that this does <strong>not</strong> imply that my life as a whole has been good, just that my life at the current moment is good. The fact that my life is good now does <strong>not make it okay</strong> that my former selves suffered a lot.))></p>

<h2>Oh, another thing!</h2>

<p>I have this concept that I call "freedom through obligation".</p>

<p>Sounds like a contradiction, right?</p>

<p>Think about the idea of "freedom of speech". Literally, it means that you're free to express whatever opinion you want. But, well, most people <em>literally</em> are physically capable of saying whatever they want, so what does it really mean? Or, to put it another way &ndash; freedom <em>from what?</em></p>

<p>I suppose it means freedom from negative consequences of speech.</p>

<p>But that's ridiculously impossible. The <em>point</em> of stating an opinion is to affect other people in some way, and affecting people will always have consequences. If there weren't consequences, there'd be no reason to do it. And along with the good consequences, there can be bad consequences. Even if you won't get arrested for saying the wrong thing, you might still end up annoying someone who might otherwise have hired you for a job. Or you might convince someone to follow their dreams, when they were planning to give you lots of money instead. Or whatever.</p>

<p>So, as long as you're paying attention to the consequences, you never have complete, free-wheeling freedom of speech.</p>

<p>But here comes the "obligation" part of <em>freedom through obligation</em>. Suppose you were forced to ignore the consequences, using mind control or something. Then you'd have complete freedom: you would never even think about the consequences, and so you'd end up deciding to say what you innately want to say. That's ironic, of course, because normally having an extra obligation restricts your freedom. But in this case, one freedom interferes with another.</p>

<p>Here's a simpler example: I had a bad habit once &ndash; something like cracking my knuckles. Then I decided not to do it anymore, and I stopped. By <em>taking away</em> my freedom to pursue short-term comfort (by continuing the habit), I <em>gained</em> the freedom to choose which long-term habits I keep and which ones I discard. Once again &ndash; freedom through obligation.</p>

<p>This blog is similar to the first example. It's public and has my name attached, so people can discriminate against me in real life for the things I say here. But I'm sworn to ignore their discrimination, so I can say whatever I want to say. It's similar to my moral principles, actually. I will not do something I know to be evil, even if I benefit a lot from doing so &ndash; and I will not compromise my voice, even if I benefit a lot from doing so.</p>

<h2>Wait, what does that have to do with the first thing?</h2>

<p> They're both about the idea of <em>leaving undesirable options on the table</em>, and the idea of <em>how you choose between two undesirable options</em>.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a moral principle. Like, "I will not kick dogs; kicking dogs is completely evil and depraved". And then you go to university for four years, and you're about to graduate, and then the president of your university decides to establish a policy that every student, as part of zir graduation ceremony, must kick a dog, or else ze won't receive a diploma. If you took "drop out" off the table, then you're now stuck with kicking the dog and living with the guilt for the rest of your life. And you (well, some people) can be sucked into doing that even if you think "don't kick dogs" is your highest principle. At that moment, you aren't thinking about your principles &ndash; you're thinking "I need to finish this ceremony". But if you're ever-conscious of your ability to drop out, even in the middle of your graduation, then you have the power to uphold your principles, because it's just a matter of taking the option that's better than the other option. Not kicking the dog was what you were obligated to do, while graduating was something you merely would have liked to do.</p>

<p>And, um, that might have been this blog's most ridiculous analogy yet!</p>

<p>On a less ridiculous note, I should probably tell you how this stuff affected my interactions with the abusive adults from my grade schools (in this case, ages 10-14). But this post has gone on long enough, and telling you about <em>them</em> probably deserves its own post.</p>
