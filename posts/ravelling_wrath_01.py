A pair of teenagers get caught up in a conflict between the gods.

<bigbreak>

"Ow! Fuck."

I scrambled the rest of the way over the fence, dropped down, and hopped on my bruised leg to see if it was okay. It was, so I kept running. I shouldn't have messed up jumping a fence like that, but I was in a hurry. Yali had texted me earlier that day. She'd said it was <em>important</em>.

Worse yet, they'd already kept me late after school. They gave me the usual "Rinn-Akatura-you-have-to-understand-what-is-appropriate-behavior-for-a-young-lady" spiel. Well, I didn't start the fight, and I wasn't just going to stand there and do nothing. "Appropriate behavior for a young lady" can kiss my ass.

I didn't say that to <em>them</em>, though. The Stern God's people can be awfully uptight about that. Why do the Stern run the schools, anyway? Isn't the Seeking God the one that's all about learning? But I just kept quiet and pretended to care about their lecture, so they wouldn't keep me even later. On a normal day, it would've been fun to take the piss out of them. But <em>Yali</em>.

As I jogged towards her house, I pulled out my phone to check exactly what she'd said.

<p class="text left">I have something important to tell you</p>
<p class="text left">Texting you so I don't put it off any longer</p>

We'd been dating for about a month, and Yali was one of the calmest, most patient people I'd ever met. If Yali said something was important, it was <strong>important</strong>. You know the saying &ndash; "When the Waiting God moves, beware." I scrolled through the rest of the messages:

<p class="text right">omg is there someone I'll need to beat up</p>
<p class="text left">no its much bigger than that. Think like... the gods</p>
<p class="text right">the gods?!</p>
<p class="text left">I'm not explaining this right</p>
<p class="text left">Just meet at my place after school, OK?</p>
<p class="text right">kk <3</p>
<p class="text right">omg they gave me detention >_&lt; I'll skip it tho</p>
<p class="text left">lol don't do that</p>
<p class="text right">but I wanted an excuse to skip :( jk see you right after <3</p>

The gods?! I wondered again. What could the gods have to do with us? Sure, "Our five gods are the foundation of all life in the city", but <em>really</em>. We were just a couple of kids. Weren't we?

I dashed across a street and tried to parkour my way up the high embankment on the other side. I made it, barely. It was just a couple more blocks uphill to the side-gate I was going to use.

Our city was built on a hill. It had five circular layers, separated by five walls, each with its own great gate, to honor the five gods who watched over us all. Supposedly. In real life, only four of the gods were worshipped, and only three of them had taxes and temples. And each of the walls had a dozen smaller gates, and the outer wall was in total ruins, and the only beings I'd noticed "watching over me" were those hypocrites who ran the schools. May the Stern God take them.

Anyway, <em>I</em> lived on the fifth layer, at the bottom. Our school was on the fourth layer, and <em>Yali</em> lived on the third. So it was always an uphill run to get there. I <em>could</em> take a bus, but when I'm excited to see her, I don't like to just sit around and wait. Plus, the bus couldn't take a shortcut through some shmuck's backyard like I was doing.
