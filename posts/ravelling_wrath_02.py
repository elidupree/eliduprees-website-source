<h2>Chapter 2: The Plan</h2>

"This is your mind."

Yali put a piece of paper on the table in front of us.

"<em>This</em> –" she drew a square at one end of the paper "– is where you are right now. And <em>this</em> –" she drew a square at the other end "– is where you have to get in order to kill me."

"In order <em>to</em> kill you?"

"Think of it as a board game you're going to play against the Blood God. Your piece starts here, and the <em>god</em> tries to move it over there, while <em>you</em> try to move it back."

"Okay…"

"Now, <em>this</em> –" Yali drew a line across the middle of the paper, separating the starting square from the ending square. "– this wall is your love for me. It's a very strong wall, and a very important one. The problem is, the Blood God's will is also strong. It can batter down the wall, like it did for Aihael." Yali drew an arrow straight across the wall, from start to finish. "So I want to build <em>more</em> defenses in your mind, so you'll be ready for it."

"That… makes sense, but what kind of defenses are you talking about? Would you, like… put a sorcery on me?"

"No, not sorcery. I mean I think we can teach you regular mental skills. Like –" Yali drew a series of boxes "– there are a lot of steps you'd have to go through before you even <em>get</em> to the wall. The Blood God will have to make you angry. It'll have to <em>direct</em> that anger towards <em>me</em>. And it'll have to make you think you have to hurt me – I mean, make you think the way to <em>act</em> on your anger is to hurt me, rather than doing something else. And all of those things are things you can resist. Like, you can practice resisting them in regular life, too."

"Like I could practice calming myself down?"

"Yes. Or –" she went through the boxes in order "– redirecting your anger, or expressing it in ways that aren't violent, or –"

"Hang on," I said. I needed a minute to wrap my head around this. "So to stop the Blood God from messing with my head, I can learn to mess with my <em>own</em> head in the other direction. Cool. I don't quite see how I'd <em>practice</em> doing that stuff, though. But let me guess, you've got a plaaaan for that, too."

Yali smiled. "Well, whenever you're in a situation that makes you angry –"

"That's the problem," I interrupted. "I don't actually get angry very often."

Yali gave me a Look.

"I'm serious!" I said. "Just because I've been in a few fights –"

"And yell at people in the hallways –"

"Those assholes! <em>Someone</em> had to stop them harassing Nika. Look, I just don't put up with people's bullshit. That doesn't mean I'm actually mad at them. Not <em>really</em> mad, anyway… come on, don't tell me you don't believe me!"

"No, I believe you." Yali stopped and thought for a minute. "That… could actually make things harder."

"Well, if the point is just to get me mad, so that I can practice getting less mad or whatever..." I began. That was kind of a weird idea, but also kind of intriguing. Like a challenge. "Why don't you just <em>make</em> me mad?"

"But… how? You just said –"

"It can't be that hard if we're doing it on purpose. You could yell at me, pester me… you could even hit me if that's what it takes, I wouldn't mind."

"<em>Hit</em> you? Even if that would work… I don't want to hurt you."

"I'm the one who's suggesting it. So if you hit me, it's no different than if I was hitting myself. Would you stop me from hitting myself?"

"Well, no, but –" Yali laughed suddenly. "I suppose if I'm asking <em>you</em> to be willing to hurt <em>me</em> for the sake of the plan, it's only fair if <em>I'm</em> willing to hurt <em>you</em> for the sake of the plan."

"Heh, that <em>is</em> kind of funn— Wait a minute, when were you going to ask me to <em>actually</em> hurt you?! I thought the point was to <em>not</em> hurt you!"

"Oh. I, I guess I hadn't gotten to that part yet." Yali put her finger on the paper again. "What we've talked about so far are just the defenses on <em>this</em> side of the wall. But we can also think about defenses on the <em>other</em> side. I mean, in case you do get angry enough to hurt me even though you love me. Even if that happens, we can still avoid the worst case, if you hurt me in a way that doesn't <em>kill</em> me. So –"

"No way!" I said. "Are you seriously suggesting I practice hurting you on purpose just so that I can do it in a way that doesn't kill you?! That's – whatever, fine, I get it, I might have to do some things I don't want to do, but even looking past that, this can't be a good idea, can it? If I get used to hurting you, that's like breaking down my <em>own</em> barriers for free."

"Maybe… But if we don't break them down here, then when they break down in the Otherworld, you'll be totally unprepar—"

"And how are you even just talking about this? You're so calm, even though you're talking about having me hurt you… This is some really grim shit."

"You were literally just talking about having me hurt you as if <em>that</em> was nothing."

"That really is no big deal for me. Seriously, I'm not being hypocritical here – we don't have the same, you know –"

"I get what you mean. But even so, it's to make sure we stay alive. In the long run, if I have to go through some pain, it doesn't really matter."

"What you mean, it doesn't matter? Of course it matters! If you're in pain, that matters!"

Yali looked down, and for a moment I was worried I had hurt her feelings somehow. But then she smiled ruefully. "I should have known you'd feel that way," she said. "Well, we don't <em>have</em> to do it. Certainly not right away. There's plenty of time before the Ravelling begins proper."

That was true. It was still ?????. And everyone knew the Ravelling started around ?????. So we had a couple of months to go.

"Speaking of time…" Yali said, glancing at the clock.

"Oh, for fuck's sake." It was almost the time my parents would want me to be home. I'd have to leave right away if I wanted to get there in time.

"It's okay. We can talk more tomorrow –"

"No way. I still have a zillion questions. I'm not, what was it, Dr.-Patience-Foresight-And-Planning over here. I want to know <em>now</em>. Plus, my parents won't be <em>that</em> mad."

"I thought you said –"

"I'll just tell them I was with you. They think you're <em>responsible</em> and shit."

"They don't mind that I'm a Seti?" she said wryly.

"Ugh, they probably <em>like</em> it." Yali's full name was Yali Seti. And Seti wasn't just any ordinary name. It was a really common name for the rich people who lived in the upper layers. If you called someone "a Seti", it didn't necessarily mean someone who actually had that name – it meant someone who was acting like a stuck-up rich person in general. Yali obviously wasn't stuck-up, but people definitely didn't look at her the same way after they learned her name.

But Mom and Dad... They were always talking about the "good old days", which meant "the days before Grandma died and Grandpa got sick and we had to sell our house and move down from the second layer of the city to the fifth layer of the city". I didn't remember that stuff because it all happened when I was just two years old, but Mom and Dad wouldn't shut up about it. They thought we were so much better than everyone because they lived in a mansion once.

I continued, "They're only really mad if they think I'm hanging out with Fasia's goons."

"Fasia as in Fasia Namaar, the gang leader?" Yali looked at me curiously. "Are you <em>actually</em> friends with any gangsters?"

"Hell if I know. Do actual gangsters tell everyone they're gangsters? 'course, Mom and Dad think anyone named ????? is a gangster. They know an awful lot about the Stern God, but not much about real people." I made a face. "Shit, what am I going to tell them about all this?"

"About us being in the Ravelling? Hmm… How far do you think it's safe to trust them?"

"Safe? You think it might not be <em>safe?</em>"

"I…" Yali trailed off.

"I'm not saying they're going to… whatever. I'm just saying, how would they even react to this? They already don't know <em>anything</em> about my life right now. I'm not sure they even know I'm a lesbian!"

Yali startled. "I thought you introduced me as your girlfriend!"

"I <em>did</em>," I said morosely. "But now they're always talking about 'your friend Yali' and 'Yali from school'… Ugh, I don't even know why I'm complaining about this. With the, you know, literal life-and-death stuff going on."

Distractedly, Yali said, "If it has an effect on your emotions, it might <em>be</em> part of the literal life-and-death stuff. But…" She trailed off again. It looked like she had something on her mind.

"What's the matter?" I said.

"I don't want to ask you for this," she said uneasily. "It's the kind of thing an abuser would do."

"What!? What are you thinking of asking for?"

"For you not to tell anyone else about this. That we're going to be Ravellers."

"Why not?"

"There are people who, who, who can't be allowed to know that I'm the Farseer. I don't mean because of the magic, it's a, a, a personal thing."

"What kind of –"

"I'm not ready to talk about it. It's just, it's just… Never mind. The point is, if we tell anyone… word could get around. But… I can't ask you not to tell anyone. That would be…"

"Look, if it has to be a secret, that's not a big deal for me. I'm not sure who I would tell anyway. And you're definitely not an abuser, you're like the total opposite –"

Yali didn't seem very reassured. "It's important for you to be able to talk to someone about it. I have the memories of the old Farseers to look to, but you'd only have me. What if I can't give you all the support you need? What if it strains our relationship and then –"

"That's, like, way too much pressure to put on yourself," I said.

"Right, if I was the only one you could talk to, then I'd feel like I had to do everything –"

"No, I meant the other way around! I mean your – you said you had a 'personal thing'? I wish I knew what it was here, but I can respect that, but like, what are you going to do – <em>not</em> have a personal thing? You're allowed to have some personal things! And every time you have a personal thing, are you going to be worrying about whether it strains our relationship? Seriously, it's okay, I'm literally telling you it's okay. Look, what do I have to do to convince you it's okay?"

"Hmm." Yali thought about it for a minute. "I believe you, but it still doesn't feel right. Maybe I can use my Seeing…"

"Your what? Oh, is that the magic power?"

"Yes."

"What does that have to do with – wait, actually, how <em>does</em> that work? Can you literally see the future?"

"Not exactly. It's more like fragments of possible futures. The way it works is, I think of something I'm planning to do, and it shows me what will happen if I go through with it. So I can think of someone for you to tell about this, and then see if telling them what lead to, to, to anything bad."

"Awesome," I said. I still didn't see why this was so important, but I didn't get to see people doing actual magic very often, so I was excited for this.

"It takes a lot out of me, though," she said. "So I'd like to put that off until later this evening. At the very least we should eat something first."

"Stern take it, I wasn't hungry until you mentioned food!" I said. Yali chuckled.

???? food

??? "Let's try your idea. See if we can make you mad."

"Alright, bring it on."

"What – but I don't know what to do. Or what you're okay with."

"Like I said, you can yell at me, hit me… just about anything, as long as it wouldn't actually injure anyone."

"Anything? Like including, say… publicly humiliating you?"

"Woah!"

"I don't mean I want to do that, I mean… I want you to think about what your boundaries are. 'Anything' is scary. It's so easy to accidentally hurt somebody."

"When have <em>you</em> ever hurt somebody?"

"You'd be surprised. Just think about it."

"Fine, I get it. I haven't thought of every way this could go wrong. Let me think… okay, let's not involve other people, and let's not… do anything that would <em>permanently</em> hurt me, but like, temporary pain is okay."

"But yelling the wrong thing at somebody <em>can</em> permanently hurt them."

"Okay, then nothing that would permanently hurt my <em>body</em>. You can yell whatever."

"So, like, yelling hurtful things that aren't true?"

"Sure."

"How about hurtful things that <em>are</em> true?"

"Of course – Oh, I see. True things could actually hurt more. But go ahead, I can take it."

"Okay!" said Yali. Then she hesitated. "What <em>would</em> you actually find hurtful?"

"I dunno. I guess you could call me weak?"

"You're weak," said Yali.

"Uh huh."

"You're weak. You're so weak. You're such a weakling," said Yali loudly.

"I'm not though."

"Uh… You're horrible. I hate you."

"Nope."

"You're an impudent child."

"LOL screw off."

"Don't use that disrespectful tone with me, <em>young lady</em>."

I burst out laughing. "Sorry, you're right, that <em>would</em> piss me off, if someone else said it. But I just <em>can't</em> believe it when it's coming from you. You're just so lovable and… harmless."

"I'm not as harmless as I look." Yali thought about something for a moment. "Why do you keep making assumptions about me?" she said sharply.

"What?"

"I do all this work to be careful and make sure I'm not hurting you, but then you just brush it off! As if I had no chance of hurting you in the first place! Why won't you take my worries seriously?!"

"I was just <em>telling</em> you what was true about <em>me</em> –" I began irritably. "Ohhhhhh. You said that to make me mad. It's not what you were really thinking."

"I did say it to make you mad. But it <em>was</em> what I was really thinking, sort of. That's why it sort of worked."

"Well <em>that's</em> a mindfuck."

"Let's not do it again," said Yali.

"Yeah," I said. "So… you were really thinking that stuff?"

"I mean, that's not how I would have said it if I wasn't trying to make you mad on purpose –"

"I know! I agreed to this, I'm not accusing you. But… you really <em>don't</em> like me thinking of you as harmless?"

"I, well – yes and no? I mean, if you think of me that way, that means I'm doing a good job of, like, not harming you. And that's nice. But I'm <em>not</em> harmless. I know that."

"I think I get it," I said. "Shit, I said a lot of stuff like that about you today, didn't I? Sorry. I'll try to be more sensitive about that."

"Thanks." Yali laughed. "We're solving our relationship conflicts too fast! Now this will never work."

"That's terrible," I joked back.

"But really, I still have more things to try. I'm just not sure about this next thing, because, because…"

"Whatever it is, bring it on!"

Yali hesitated.

"Or is that too much of a 'you're harmless' thing? It's not though, I'd probably say that to anyone. Unless they were pointing a knife at me or something."

Yali laughed. "You're right. I'm glad we talked about this. I'm okay to 'bring it on' now. Whenever you're ready."

"Ready."

Yali closed her eyes.

When she opened them again, it was like she was a completely different person. She lurched to her feet, grabbed my arm, and yanked me out of when I was sitting. By the time I had gotten my balance and stood up, she was towering over me. Yali didn't normally look that much taller than me, because she slouched a lot, but when she <em>did</em> stand up straight, she was almost a head taller than me.

Yali twisted my arm into a painful position. Her voice was cold and unfeeling. "<em>You think you're tough? You're not tough. You're pathetic.</em>"

"Uh," I said nervously, "I still know that's not tr—"

"<em>Shut up. You don't know anything.</em>"

I glared up into her eyes. But she wasn't even looking back at me. She was looking past me as if I was totally insignificant. I felt trapped and confused. Who was this monster and what was it doing in Yali's body? I reflexively tried to shove her away from me. But she just twisted harder on my arm and I yelled out in pain.

"<em>Shut. Up. Don't make a sound, you worthless child.</em>"

We were just play-acting, right? I looked up into Yali's eyes for reassurance, but there was nothing there. What was going on? I could feel my whole body starting to tense up.

Wait a minute. I was Rinn Akatura. I could handle anything. I forced myself to laugh and relax. It wasn't even that much pain, anyway.

Just then Yali let go of me, stepped back and closed her eyes again. When she opened them, she was back to normal.

"You could've kept going," I said.

"How are you feeling?" said Yali gently.

"That was fuckin' scary!" I said. "Not in a bad way! I mean, that was the point, right? Why'd you stop?"

Yali visibly relaxed. "Two reasons. Well, three, actually. First, I needed to check in with you to make sure you were okay –" I rolled my eyes. Yali hugged me and tousled my hair affectionately. "I know you're tough. I didn't really think you weren't going to be okay, but it's always good to keep checking."

"The second reason," she continued, "is that I'm not sure <em>I</em> can handle doing that for very long. And the third one is… It wasn't working."

"It almost worked! If you'd gone on for a bit longer…"

"I saw what happened," said Yali. "It only worked because you weren't expecting it. And that's pretty much what I thought would happen. This is how you usually deal with anger, isn't it? As soon as you noticed that you were getting angry, you turned it into a challenge. Right?"

"Stern take it all, you know me better than I know myself. You <em>thought</em> this would happen?!"

"Honestly, as soon as you suggested having me yell at you and hit you. You weren't imagining something that would <em>actually</em> make you angry. Having people yell at you and hit you… Those are things are comfortable with. In a way. Like they're things you know how to handle. And that's going to be... Like, the way you can turn things into a challenge is a really good skill. It's going to help you a lot in the Otherworld. But if we want to find out what your limits are, we'll have to come up with something else."
???
Hang on, are <em>you</em> okay? ??? Never mind, I guess.
