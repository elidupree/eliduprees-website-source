<h2>Chapter 2: The Plan</h2>

"This is your mind."

Yali put a piece of paper on the table in front of us.

"<em>This</em> –" she drew a square at one end of the paper "– is where you are right now. And <em>This</em> –" she drew a square at the other end "– is where you have to get in order to kill me."

"In order <em>to</em> kill you?"

"Think of it as a board game you're going to play against the Blood God. Your piece starts here, and the <em>god</em> tries to move it over there, while <em>you</em> try to move it back."

"Okay…"

"Now, <em>this</em> –" Yali drew a line across the middle of the paper, separating the starting square from the ending square. "– this wall is your love for me. It's a very strong wall, and a very important one. The problem is, the Blood God's will is also strong. It can batter down the wall, like it did for Aihael." Yali drew an arrow straight across the wall, from start to finish. "So I want to build <em>more</em> defenses in your mind, so you'll be ready for it."

"That… makes sense, but what kind of defenses are you talking about? Would you, like… put a sorcery on me?"

"No, not sorcery. I mean I think we can teach you regular mental skills. Like –" Yali drew a series of boxes "– there are a lot of steps you'd have to go through before you even <em>get</em> to the wall. The Blood God will have to make you angry. It'll have to <em>direct</em> that anger towards <em>me</em>. And it'll have to make you think you have to hurt me – I mean, make you think the way to <em>act</em> on your anger is to hurt me, rather than doing something else. And all of those things are things you can resist. Like, you can practice resisting them in regular life, too."

"Like I could practice calming myself down?"

"Yes. Or –" she went through the boxes in order "– redirecting your anger, or expressing it in ways that aren't violent, or –"

"Hang on," I said. I needed a minute to wrap my head around this. "So to stop the Blood God from messing with my head, I can learn to mess with my <em>own</em> head in the other direction. Cool. I don't quite see how I'd <em>practice</em> doing that stuff, though. But let me guess, you've got a plaaaan for that, too."

Yali smiled. "Well, whenever you're in a situation that makes you angry –"

"That's the problem," I interrupted. "I don't actually get angry very often."

Yali gave me a Look.

"I'm serious!" I said. "Just because I've been in a few fights –"

"And yell at people in the hallways –"

"Those assholes! <em>Someone</em> had to stop them harassing Nika. Look, I just don't put up with people's bullshit. That doesn't mean I'm actually mad at them. Not <em>really</em> mad, anyway… come on, don't tell me you don't believe me!"

"No, I believe you." Yali stopped and thought for a minute. "That… could actually make things harder."

"Well, if the point is just to get me mad, so that I can practice getting less mad or whatever..." I began. This was actually an intriguing idea. "Why don't you just <em>make</em> me mad?"

"But… how? You just said –"

"It can't be that hard if we're doing it on purpose. You could yell at me, pester me… you could even hit me if that's what it takes, I wouldn't mind."

"<em>Hit</em> you? But… I don't want to hurt you."

"I'm the one who's suggesting it. So if you hit me, it's no different than if I was hitting myself. Would you stop me from hitting myself?"

"Well, no, but –" Yali laughed suddenly. "I suppose if I'm asking <em>you</em> to be willing to hurt <em>me</em> for the sake of the plan, it's only fair if <em>I'm</em> willing to hurt <em>you</em> for the sake of the plan."

"Heh, that <em>is</em> kind of funn— Wait a minute, when were you going to ask me to <em>actually</em> hurt you?! I thought the point was to <em>not</em> hurt you!"

"Oh. I, I guess I hadn't gotten to that part yet." Yali put her finger on the paper again. "What we've talked about so far are just the defenses on <em>this</em> side of the wall. But we can also think about defenses on the <em>other</em> side. I mean, in case you do get angry enough to hurt me even though you love me. Even if that happens, we can still avoid the worst case, if you hurt me in a way that doesn't <em>kill</em> me. So –"

"No way!" I said. "Are you seriously suggesting I practice hurting you on purpose just so that I can do it in a way that doesn't kill you?! That's – whatever, fine, I get it, I might have to do some things I don't want to do, but even looking past that, this can't be a good idea, can it? If I get used to hurting you, that's like breaking down my <em>own</em> barriers for free."

"Maybe… But if we don't break them down here, then when they break down in the Otherworld, you'll be totally unprepar—"

"And how are you even just talking about this? You're so calm, even though you're talking about having me hurt you… This is some really grim shit."

"You were literally just talking about having me hurt you as if <em>that</em> was nothing."

"That really is no big deal for me. Seriously, I'm not being hypocritical here – we don't have the same, you know –"

"I get what you mean. But even so, it's to make sure we stay alive. In the long run, if I have to go through some pain, it doesn't really matter."

"What you mean, it doesn't matter? Of course it matters! If you're in pain, that matters!"

Yali looked down, and for a moment I was worried I had hurt her feelings somehow. But then she smiled ruefully. "I should have known you'd feel that way," she said. "Well, we don't <em>have</em> to do it. Certainly not right away. There's plenty of time before the Ravelling begins proper."

That was true. It was still ?????. And everyone knew the Ravelling started around ?????. So we had a couple of months to go.

"Speaking of time…" Yali said, glancing at the clock.

"Oh, for fuck's sake." It was almost the time my parents would want me to be home. I'd have to leave right away if I wanted to get there in time.

"It's okay. We can talk more tomorrow –"

"No way. I still have a zillion questions. I'm not, what was it, Dr.-Patience-Foresight-And-Planning over here. I want to know <em>now</em>. Plus, my parents won't be <em>that</em> mad."

"I thought you said –"

"I'll just tell them I was with you. They think you're <em>responsible</em> and shit."

"They don't mind that I'm a Seti?" she said wryly.

"Ugh, they probably <em>like</em> it." Yali's full name was Yali Seti. And Seti wasn't just any ordinary name. It was a really common name for the rich people who lived in the upper layers. If you called someone "a Seti", it didn't necessarily mean someone who actually had that name – it meant someone who was acting like a stuck-up rich person in general. Yali obviously wasn't stuck-up, but people definitely didn't look at her the same way after they learned her name.

But Mom and Dad... They were always talking about the "good old days", which meant "the days before Grandma died and Grandpa got sick and we had to sell our house and move down from the second layer of the city to the fifth layer of the city". I didn't remember that stuff because it all happened when I was just two years old, but Mom and Dad wouldn't shut up about it. They thought we were so much better than everyone because they lived in a mansion once.
