<p>Before we can really talk about pornography, we have to know what it is. Of course, defining "pornography" is notoriously difficult; there's even a quote from a former United States Supreme Court Justice saying "perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so".<footnote((See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">this Wikipedia article about that statement</a>.))> I usually don't like going to dictionaries for answers, because dictionaries are usually a few steps behind the natural evolution of the language, but here, I'll go ahead and ask a dictionary. At the time of this writing, Wiktionary defines "pornography" as:</p>

<blockquote>The explicit depiction of sexual subject matter, especially with the sole intention of sexually exciting the viewer.</blockquote>

<p>That wasn't so hard.<footnote((I guess it's not hard to define it as long as you're not trying to decide when ambiguously-written Puritanical censorship laws are allowed under the rules of an equally ambiguous document, namely the United States Constitution.))> So, we're basically talking about stories, pictures, videos, and so on, of people having sex or being in sexual situations, <a href="/blog/sex">whatever that means</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, sounds great, right? I mean, most people enjoy a certain amount of sexual excitement. And, compared with other ways of getting sexually excited, pornography is incredibly low-risk and easy to distribute. Some ways, like printing lots of pornographic magazines, consume some of the Earth's resources, which is kinda bad, but we now have digital media and the Internet. And I don't think anyone has ever been physically abused by their porn, or gotten pregnant from it, or anything like that.</p>

<p>And it gets better: Exchanging honest depictions of <em>anything</em> helps people, because knowledge is good, and the exchange of ideas helps people understand things better and learn about other people's perspectives. As I've mentioned before, this is especially important right now for sexual stuff, because our society has nowhere <em>near</em> enough honest conversations about sex and sexuality. Sure, there's lots of sex and sexuality in our society, but it's mostly yucky. Like, even <em>more</em> yucky than most of the other stuff in our society. That's pretty damn yucky. So we could definitely use more good pornography.</p>

<h2>But wait!</h2>

<p>Since I already quoted one famous person in this post, I might as well quote another.</p>

<blockquote>...pornography is the orchestrated destruction of women's bodies and souls; rape, battery, incest, and prostitution animate it; dehumanization and sadism characterize it; it is war on women, serial assaults on dignity, identity, and human worth; it is tyranny. Each woman who has survived knows from the experience of her own life that pornography is captivity--the woman trapped in the picture used on the woman trapped wherever he's got her.</blockquote>

<p>That's Andrea Dworkin.<footnote((This is from Dworkin's book "Pornography: Men Possessing Women". <a href="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/PornIntro2.html">The relevant section is hosted here</a> (TRIGGER WARNING for details of rape and physical violence).))> I'm quoting Dworkin because ze's essentially the <em>icon</em> of anti-porn feminism. I disagree with some of the things ze says,<footnote((Like saying that "sadism" is a bad thing. It's totally okay if you practice it with consent from all participants.))> and there are definitely some problems with zir writing, but ze did have a lot of insight and a <em>lot</em> of influence on the feminist movement.</p>

<p>So, um. How did we get from "Pornography is pretty cool" to "Pornography is totally evil"?</p>

<p>Let's take a step back and I'll tell you something. I've been watching some porn videos recently. Free, online porn videos, to be specific. I won't give links, because I have a policy of not linking to things that are openly racist, sexist, and so on,<footnote((Remind me to write that post about why we can sometimes get positive effects from stories even when the stories have big problems in them.))> but they're not hard to find.</p>

<p><q>But Eli</q>, you say, "How can you enjoy porn if you don't feel sexual attraction to people?". It's a valid question. And, first, it's <em>true</em> &ndash; I don't enjoy most porn. But there's some porn that I do enjoy, because although I don't feel sexual attraction, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">mirror neurons</a> are fully functional. When I'm watching a porn video, I can feel as if I'm one of the people in the video, and imagine how it feels to be doing what they're doing; I can identify with them.</p>

<p>But, in mainstream porn, with very, <em>very</em> few exceptions, I can only identify with the female people.<footnote((Since mainstream porn has very rigid gender roles, this implies both female-sexed and female-gendered.))> I'd kind of <em>like</em> to be able to identify with the male ones, because they have bodies that are more like mine, but when male people do appear in the porn I've been watching, they just don't act like they're enjoying themselves. When they're on top, or standing, they hold themselves in a really stiff way, and don't relax. When they <em>do</em> relax, when they're supposedly receiving pleasure, they just go limp. They don't squirm around like I would or like the female people do. In short, their <em>bodies</em> are more like mine, but their <em>behavior</em> is so much <em>less</em> like mine that I can't relate to them at all.</p>

<p>And that's part of what Andrea Dworkin is getting at. Mainstream porn has a certain amount of variety, but it only shows a very limited range of what male sexuality is supposed to be like. It says: If you've got a penis, you're not supposed to enjoy yourself; you're supposed to be dominant over other people. And... seriously! There is no good reason for that! It's a bad thing to do <em>and</em> it isn't what people want! Seriously, science people have studied it, and it turns out that when you ask them in private, most male people will tell you they actively dislike the whole "masculinity equals dominance (and hypersexuality)" crap! It's like people who say that movies with female protagonists won't sell, even though there is already abundant evidence against that assertion! It seems like the entire industry is conspiring <em>just to annoy me</em>, because there really isn't a better explanation than that!<footnote((I think it's actually just because the people in the porn industry aren't very creative.))></p>

<p>And, besides that, there are about a million other huge problems with mainstream porn, like the way it sets prescriptive standards for attractiveness,<footnote((Like "be female-sexed, shave every part of your body except your scalp, have long hair, and be white" &ndash; and when a non-white person DOES appear in mainstream porn, they're <em>fetishized</em>, which just goes to show that no matter what you do, you can always find a way to do it horribly wrong.))> and the way it's often a model for unrealistic and unhealthy beavior. And <em>that</em>'s how we got from "porn is pretty cool" to "porn is really bad": by looking at how it's actually practiced, rather than just considering it as an abstract concept...</p>

<p>...and <em>those</em> are the points on which I agree with Andrea Dworkin and anti-porn feminism. There's a big problem with pornography. So what's the solution? Their ideal solution is to eliminate porn entirely. Now, I'm going to ignore the fact that that's impossible, becase as you probably know, I'm a big fan of pursuing goals that seem impossible. What I <em>am</em> going to say is that, if this impossible goal was achieved, it would be horrible! Current porn has problems, but in essence, pornography is a good thing, a healthy thing, a positive thing. If I made a porn video that kicked people in the face, then I would be guilty of kicking people in the face, but it wouldn't be because I made a porn video; it would be because, for some bizarre reason, I decided to have it kick people in the face. And in <em>exactly the same way</em>, if I make porn that's degrading to a particular group of people, or that promotes unhealthy relationship dynamics, then I'm guilty of degrading people and decreasing relationships' health, and that has very little to do with the fact that what I made was pornographic.</p>

<p>The solution to the problems with porn is <em>to make better porn</em>.</p>

<p>Hmm, maybe I should do that sometime.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="/blog/neurodiversity">when I said we should talk about how we experience the world</a>? This post is me doing that.</p>

<p>I can't imagine pain. At all. Or, to be more specific, there's <em>something</em> I can do that I call "imagining" &ndash; which might, or might not, be exactly the same thing as what other people call "imagining" &ndash; that works very well for sight, and sound, and physical touch, and a few other things, but doesn't work at all for physical pain. With other sensations, I can conjure up the feeling and have a sense that's almost as strong as actually feeling it, but with pain it just doesn't work &ndash; I can try to conjure up the feeling of pain, but nothing happens.</p>

<p>The same is true in my dreams and my memories. Even if I've actually experienced pain recently, like if I stubbed my toe, I can't <em>remember</em> the actual feeling of pain afterwards any more than I could normally imagine it.<footnote((As far as I know, when the brain remembers a sensory experience, it uses pretty much the same process that it does to imagine one, so this shouldn't be too surprising.))> My dreams usually have visual images in them, and occasionally have sounds or touch-sensations; they try to be semi-realistic, so, for instance, if someone hits a gong in my dream, the dream provides the sensation of hearing a gong sound. But if someone drops something on my foot, then the dream <em>tries</em> to provide a pain sensation, but <em>fails</em>.</p>

<p>Since I've never been anyone but myself, I don't automatically know whether anyone else shares this attribute. So, after I was thinking about this yesterday, I decided to ask my biological parents.<footnote((Who are also my legal and social parents. I say "biological parents" because the genetic relation is the most important thing here.))> And that was interesting, because <em>one</em> of them said ze could imagine pain as easily as anything else, and the <em>other</em> said ze couldn't.</p>

<p>So, dear readers, I'm curious: Does <em>your</em> imagination work this way? Please leave a comment if you feel comfortable doing so!</p>

<h2>1.</h2>

<p>I once had a conversation with two friends. At some point, the following exchange happened (heavily paraphrased, since this was more than a year ago and I didn't write it down):</p>

<blockquote><p>Me: This is kind of an oversimplification, but: Privileged people make statements about the world, and oppressed people make statements about themselves.</p>
<p>Friend 1: I hadn't thought about it that way. I can see how that relates to my experiences.</p></blockquote>

<p>At which point Friend 2 pointed out how I'd made a statement about the world, while Friend 1 had made a statement about zemself! (Which fits the description, since I'm pretty sure I'm much more privileged than Friend 1.) The theory goes that privileged people don't tend to recognize their privilege, so they assume that the world works the same way for everybody, while people who lack those privileges are acutely aware of the fact that some other people have things that they don't have.</p>

<p>Now, here's an interesting thing: Talking about the world, and not talking about oneself, is a bit of a red flag for me when it applies to other people. I'm automatically slightly wary of people who don't talk about their own experiences &ndash; it's not a particularly strong feeling, just one of the many things that factors into my perception of a person. But <em>I'm</em> also like that, often.<footnote((Or at least, I used to be. Since I've started noticing it, I've also started making sure I don't do it as much as I used to &ndash; not for a social reason, though, but for an intellectual reason. I'm compulsively honest, so I don't like saying things that I don't know to be true, and it's much more honest to state things in terms of how I know them than it is to state them as objective truths. And that goes double for what I write on this blog.))> I can have long, abstract conversations that aren't grounded in my own experiences at all, because I'm so sure that I know objective truths.</p>

<p>So, would I be wary of myself? I can't know that for sure, but I think I wouldn't be, because... Well, to tell you that, I'll tell you this first:</p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p>On January 4, 2011, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>If I say "I feel [feeling] about [event]", it's probably false. Call me out on it. I want to stop pretending so much.</blockquote>

<p>Sometime during high school &ndash; ages 15-16, I think &ndash; I became much better at communicating and socializing with a large subset of the people of my own age. I don't know exactly why that happened; it was probably a combination of several things. One of them is that I was changing neurologically as I aged; one of them is that the people my age had started to become mature and intelligent enough that I was actually interested in talking to them.</p>

<p>One of the trite-but-generally-true things that people say about non-empaths is that we're very good at faking emotions. Or, I'm not sure if <em>faking</em> is quite the right word. For me, once I started actually trying to engage with people in a peer-social way, it was natural to view communication as a process of trying out different ways of expressing ideas, seeing how people responded, and adjusting my way of expressing myself to achieve the most favorable outcome. So natural that I do it all without thinking, and it doesn't feel like fakery at all.</p>

<p>Take a step back again...</p>

<p>In the years before those, the special-education-school-people seemed to think that I should improve my "social skills". I quite firmly believed that there is no objective standard of good communication, that pushing a particular standard on someone is an injustice, and that if I adapted to the system they were advocating, then I would in fact become <em>worse</em> at some types of communication as I became "better" at the kind of peer-social activities which they thought were important and which I wasn't interested in.</p>

<p>Naturally, I still believe all of those things. I could ramble on for quite some time about those things, and probably will in a future post. But there's one particular attribute of myself that is relevant to both that and to this post as a whole:</p>

<p>I am compulsively honest. I cannot lie or intentionally mislead another person.<footnote((Well, except that I'm a good actor. I think that if you gave me time to prepare, and a really good reason (like lying to someone who's plotting murder about where their intended victim is), I could lie without hesitation. But that's not a very common situation.))> If someone asks me a question, I am compelled to either answer it as accurately as I can, or explicitly refuse to answer it.</p>

<p>The "social skills" people don't like that. They think that you're supposed to tell "white lies"; you're supposed to try to play the social game, and not make things disruptive or awkward, even if that means saying things that are false and misleading. Now, let's pretend for a moment that I can <em>choose</em> whether or not to be honest, and ask whether I <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>The "social skills" people aren't entirely wrong. There <em>are</em> a lot of people who express a preference<footnote((I say "who express a preference" instead of "who prefer" because, when habitual lying is involved, I can't be sure exactly what other people think. I'm not trying to question their truthfulness, but as I mentioned, I am compelled not to overstate my knowledge.))> for the social system that has lots of lies in it. But there are also a lot of people who express a preference for honesty. So if I go around telling lies, I'm not "having good social skills" &ndash; I'm declaring an <em>allegiance</em> to one category of social skills over another. Every time I tell someone they look good when I think they don't, every time I say I liked someone's art when I was bored by it, I'm waving a flag and saying "Hey liars, look, I'm a liar just like you! Call me. We can hang out and tell some lies together." And if I tell the truth, I'm saying "Hey truth-tellers..."</p>

<p>Those might not be the most charitable descriptions. I think I'll call the categories "Placators" and "Truth-seekers" instead.</p>

<p>I'll conclude the tangent about my schooling by saying, the "social skills" people were placators in positions of petty authority who thought that everyone else should be a placator too, and anyone who wasn't a placator was deviant. Fuck 'em. It also bears mentioning that most people aren't pure placators or pure truth-seekers, if the descriptions even fit at all.</p>

<p>If I was a placator, and was primarily motivated by making the social game run smoothly, then I wouldn't have the slightest problem with adjusting my communication style to mimic the style of neurotypical people. But I'm not! So, to go back to the example, when I noticed myself saying things like "I hate it when...", I had a problem with that. Because, when I said that, I wasn't saying that I had actually experienced hatred. It was just a social gesture. It was me saying something false and misleading in order to make a conversation run smoothly, because I don't actually have feelings like that. I sometimes feel hatred, and I sometimes observe that things are very bad and should change, but I don't feel hatred <em>towards</em> the things. There's no emotional connection between stuff in my head and physical reality, just causal relationships.</p>

<h2>3.</h2>

<p>But a lot of people say those things honestly. And to go back to the beginning...</p>

<p>Most people have a lot of feelings that I don't have. They love people, they enjoy pure social interaction, and so forth; they <em>care strongly about things from their physical lives</em>. And what I realized &ndash; the realization that inspired me to write this post &ndash; was that when I'm wary of people who talk too much about abstract ideas, it's not because of that fact. It's because I've gotten the sense that they're not being honest. Because if you're talking about things that you're mildly interested in, but not talking about things that you really care about, that seems dishonest to me. I don't think there's necessarily anything <em>wrong</em> with it &ndash; e.g. if that's your way of staying away from subjects that you don't want to talk about but are socially unacceptable to dodge, more power to you &ndash; but I get along much better with people who are closer to the kind of radical honesty that I am compelled to practice myself.</p>

<p>And that's why I think I wouldn't be wary of myself: I'd be able to tell that the abstract ideas <em>are</em> the primary thing I care about. That instead of being a mask that hides my feelings, it's a true reflection of them.</p>

<p>I still haven't been doing much for a while - mostly playing online games, watching videos, and so forth. Oh, and running a quirky Mafia variant on an internet forum - you can <a href="http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=73126">check it out over here on the XKCD forums</a> if you're into that sort of thing. My inactivity has a lot to do with the fact that it's late in the summer, it's hot all the time, and I haven't been talking to other people too much. (Getting at least a little interaction with other people helps me, because it stimulates my mind and gives me new ideas.) I'm going to be going back to college relatively soon, too, and that's discouraging me from getting into projects a bit, even though I still have about three weeks left.</p>

<p>That said, I've still got a couple of projects running. I'm working on them occasionally, it's just that they're not taking the majority of my time.</p>

<p>One of them is that I'm learning more Javascript, so that I can make cool online games and utilities. <a href="/pac-asteroids-first.html">Check out this extremely-unfinished game for an example of what I'm messing with</a>. (EDIT: That's a link to the version that I wrote at the time of this post. <a href="/pac-asteroids.html">This is a link to the current version</a>, which I will keep messing with.)</p>

<p>The other is this: Since I'm blocked on the graphics editing software project, I've started just drawing stuff in an existing graphics program (namely GIMP). Here's something I randomly sketched a few days ago:</p>

<img src="/media/random_sketch_2011_08_13.png?rr" alt="Image [see below]" />
<p>(That's an image hosted on an external site. Tell me if it breaks. A transcript is in a footnote.<footnote((<p>Transcript of the above image:</p><p>Text: What shall I draw? thought I.<p>Picture: A cartoon of myself, with an excessively cheerful expression, thinking: Maybe something DARK & DISTURBING?</p><p>Picture: A gaunt face drawn in white on a black background, surrounded by orange streaks. Its thoughts are written messily: "I DON'T KNOW WHY I'VE BECOME LIKE THIS. I AM SO COLD, COLD!! <em>I DON'T NEED ANY HELP!!</em>"</p><p>Text: What sex is our friend the pyromaniac? I find it easier to read zem as male, but is the face actually characteristically male or is it just that I'm more familiar with that exaggerated gauntness on male characters, while our society makes people draw female people in pristine condition always?</p>))>)</p>

<p>I've also started sketching characters for a fairly absurd short comic (3-4 pages, probably). I might end up drawing that in the next week or two.</p>

<p>Speaking of posting comics here on this website, that's <em>yet another thing</em> that I'm going to need to do programming work for. It's not a problem if I just stick them in blog posts for the moment, but it'd be nice to have a more formal way of presenting them. I'm still planning to post that novella, too &ndash; I've edited it as much as I need to, and now the only thing stopping me from posting it is that I haven't been feeling like doing the technical end of things (and, again, I want it to be presented more nicely than just sticking it in a blog post).</p>

<p>Anyway, there's an update for you. Things will probably get more interesting when I head back to college &ndash; I'll try not to get so busy that I don't have time to blog, heh heh.</p>

<img src="/media/riotnrrd.png?rr"  alt="Image: A panel of a comic. Some interesting people stand around; one says, 'So, do you like, gender and stuff?'" />

<p>That's a panel from <i>Riot Nrrd</i>, a wonderful webcomic.</p>

<p>I think <i>Riot Nrrd</i> was one of the things that helped inspire me to make this website when I did. If you read it, you'll certainly notice some similarities between its style of talking about social issues and mine. (Heck, the first strip opens with one of the characters ranting about portrayals of minority characters in popular media!) I'd say it's a great example of how a highly accessible<footnote((Not perfectly, of course. You can't read a webcomic if you're blind, for instance. But most humans find it easy to take information from visual images, and a prudent webcomic author will provide a text transcript for those who are vision-impaired.))> (and enjoyable) format like a serial webcomic can be used to promote good ideas about gender and stuff.</p>

<p>(You might also guess that its drawing style inspired the style I used in <i>People Are Wrong Sometimes</i>, but then you'd be wrong, since I hadn't found <i>Riot Nrrd</i> when I wrote that. But I would totally have been inspired by it if I had!)</p>

<p>Oh and also, it's hilarious!</p>

<p>I recommend <i>Riot Nrrd</i> without reservation. <a href="http://www.riotnrrdcomics.com/2009/12/riot-nrrd-1-2/">The first page is here</a>. At the time of this writing, it's about 120 pages long, so it's a relatively quick read compared to the 1000+ page webcomics that you can find elsewhere on the Internet.</p>

<p>(This post will assume basic knowledge of the United States college/university system.)</p>

<p>I've just returned to college, unpacked my stuff, and organized my new dorm room.</p>

<p>This semester isn't going to by my favorite. For some reason, pretty much none of the theater/art/writing classes I want to take are being taught this semester. So I'm mostly doing math classes instead. Now, for me, math is great; it's easy, useful, and enjoyable. It's just not what I'm truly passionate about.</p>

<p>Also, I'm stuck taking my college's English Composition class that's required for all students. (Normally you're supposed to take that in your first year (I'm in my third year now), but due to a series of inconvenient coincidences, I haven't been able to complete it yet.) I love composing English prose, but writing academic essays is completely uninteresting to me. Oh well; I just hope I end up with a professor who can make the material interesting.</p>

<p>On the plus side, since I'm a math whiz, taking mostly math courses means that I'll have quite a bit of free time during this semester, which I will be able to use to do stuff like drawing graphic stories! And college is an interesting place from the outset. I get lots more contact with people, and lots of opportunities to attend talks by interesting people who are doing cool things around the world.</p>

<p>In short, my idle time of this summer is now over! I'm going to be engaged in a lot of things, and I hope to blog about them frequently.</p>
