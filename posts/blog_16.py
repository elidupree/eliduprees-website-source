The same day I finished <a href="/blog/saddlebags-2-0">Saddlebags 2.0</a>, we had a great idea for how to improve the design:

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/saddlebags-2-1-demo-1.jpg?rr" alt="[Photo: Me, wearing Saddlebags 2.1 around my hips. They are two cardboard boxes at my sides, connected by a strap.]" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 52%;"><img src="/media/saddlebags-2-1-demo-2.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 47%;">
</div>

I didn't actually need a clever system to keep the pouches from swinging. The swinging was only a problem when they could slap against the <em>fronts</em> of my legs while I ran. But these boxes are always flat at my sides, so they don't get in the way.

I can comfortably run and bicycle while carrying 10 pounds (4.5kg) of encyclopedias in these. They also held up to walking with a load of 25 pounds (11 kg). These pouches are slightly smaller, so I didn't go up to the 32 pounds I tried in 2.0, just because it was hard to fit that much stuff in them.

<img src="/media/saddlebags-2-1-demo-3.jpg?rr" alt="[Photo: a pile of corrugated cardboard in various shapes.]" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">

Compared to 2.0, these are much more <cut>convenient:
<ul>
<li>They are slimmer (when I wear them, they're 24 inches wide instead of 28). This makes it much easier to fit through doors.</li>
<li>When I'm not wearing them, I can fit them in a much smaller space. This will be important when I ride trains or buses. I can just put the two pouches in my lap instead of taking up extra seat space.</li>
<li>They're adjustable. I don't have to worry if the size will be right if I'm wearing bulky clothing, or if my body changes size over time. And when I start selling them to other people, the same design can work for all sizes of people.</li>
</ul>

Like in <a href="/blog/the-carrying-contraption">Saddlebags 1.0</a>, there's a strap in the front, but it's important that the front strap doesn't actually touch my waist. Any pressure on the front of my waist makes me feel uncomfortable if it stays there for a while. So I designed these to <em>only</em> put pressure on my hips.

<h2>Next steps</h2>

A <em>lot</em> of people have suggested I sell these to people, so I'm seriously considering it. But I'm not ready to sell them <em>quite</em> yet.

For one thing, I have no experience doing this! It's a little daunting. How do I market them? How do I take payments? How do I ship them? What legal regulations do I need to worry about? I know I can figure this stuff out, but there's just so <em>much</em> of it. If any of you have sold things before, I could use your advice.

Also, there are a bunch of design things I still need to polish:

<ul class="big_list">
<li>The pouches need to be protected from rain. I plan to add a lid and cover them with waterproof contact paper. (The contact paper doubles as a way to decorate them with nice designs!) I also want to make the top of each pouch have a slight slant away from the body, so that rain is shed outwards instead of pooling on the lids and/or pouring onto your body. I'm confident I can make this work, but I'll have to do some math to shape the supporting pieces correctly.</li>
<li>I want to build some slightly smaller boxes to organize the stuff <em>in</em> the pouches. Each one will have a small compartment just under the top lid of the box, and a larger compartment below it. That way, you can store small things at the top, then grab them easily without having to dig through the whole box. Or you can pull the organizing-box out of the pouch and open it from the side, for easy access to the bigger stuff. Or something like that.</li>
<li>The foam pads don't stay on very well. The glue doesn't fail, but the foam itself can easily tear apart if you pull on the corners. And that happens every time you put them on. For <em>myself</em>, I can just be careful and/or keep re-taping them, but if I want to sell them, I should make them more user-friendly. I need to change the design so they don't get pulled on, and/or find a tougher type of padding to use.</li>
<li>Cutting out the cardboard is too much work for me currently. I can make a few prototypes, but building a lot of them would be too much for my hands. I'll need a different way to make the pieces. For the smaller pieces, I can reasonably pay a laser-cutting service. For the boxes, laser cutting might be inefficient because they're much larger. There are companies that sell cardboard boxes in bulk, but these are an unusual shape. I haven't found a place to buy 12"x12"x3" boxes that open on one of the narrow sides. I'll need to investigate things more.</li>
<li>Right now, the strap is just a plain strap with a rolling hitch tied in it. I'm not sure this is secure enough. I should probably use a strap with a cam buckle in it.</li>
<li>One hip support started bending under the weight of 25 pounds. I had just copied the hip support design from Saddlebags 2.0. But the 2.0 hip supports weren't designed to resist force compressing them from the front and back, and 2.1 relies on them being strong in that direction. I'll need to adjust the design to take care of that.</li>
</ul>

So I have a lot of stuff to work out. But I'm very happy with what I've got so far, and I'm definitely planning to keep going with it.

"contents":'''
A few weeks ago, I built <a href="/blog/projects-update-2017-06-21">a top hat that is also an air purifier</a>. Last week, I stated building a second one. I wanted to improve on the design, and take photos of the process to show to the rest of you.

I was hoping for this to be a triumphant post about how I built a great hat, but, well… you'll see.

<h2>Materials</h2>
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-all.jpg?rr" alt="[Photo: a pile of various materials, described below.]" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<ul>
<li>A bunch of scrap cardboard.</li>
<li>Cloth with a flowery pattern, to cover the finished hat.</li>
<li>A bit of an old sleeping pad.</li>
<li>A USB cord with one end missing.</li>
<li>A 5V 40mm static pressure fan (NF-A4x20 5V).</li>
<li>A 6"x4" HEPA filter.</li>
<li>A box of cut-to-fit pre-filter, which I cut to the same size as the HEPA filter.</li>
<li>Some thin nonporous foam, for making things airtight.</li>
<li>Some white glue.</li>
<li>Some clear packing tape.</li>
</ul>

Out of these materials, my only significant costs were for the fan (about $16) and <cut>the HEPA filter (about $4). I got the rest by taking bits of old things we had in storage. If you didn't have any of the materials to start out with, it would have a much bigger up-front cost.

I also used a lot of tools – scissors, rulers, clothespins, utility knives, and more.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-various.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-tools.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

<h2>Building process</h2>

First, I turned the 3-pin fan into a USB fan. Standard USB connectors output 5-volt power, and can supply up to 0.1 amps without any fancy electrics. This particular fan is specced to run on <em>exactly</em> 5V/0.1A, so turning it into a USB fan was just a matter of connecting the wires. And the fan came with small crimp connectors that were very convenient to use.
<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-USB-fan.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/USB-cord-assembly.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/USB-cord-finished.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;">
</div>

Oops! The old USB cord I was using actually didn't work. I had to take it apart and rewire it. But I eventually did get it to run off an actual USB port.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/USB-cord-repaired.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/USB-fan-running.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

For the next step, I had to cut out all of the cardboard pieces. I printed out paper templates for all the pieces, and attached them to the cardboard so that I could cut them precisely.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-templates.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/prepared-for-cutting.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

To cut the cardboard, I mostly used utility knives, with the cardboard resting on a homemade jig that I made out of cardboard and styrofoam. The jig holds a metal straightedge in a good place so that I can cut along the straightedge with a utility knife.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/jig-setup.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/jig-cutting.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

Alas, I forgot to photograph all the cardboard pieces after I cut them out.

Cutting the cardboard took me a total of 2.75 hours. Since I've been toying with the idea of making more of these to sell, I've been thinking about the practicalities of making multiple hats. Nearly 3 hours of cutting alone is impractical for me. Doubly so because I have to be careful with my hands, due to my old injury. Counting the time I spent <em>resting</em>, the total was much more.

I could probably have this whole design cut by a laser-cutting service for about $25, which would be much more efficient. Either way, the cutting cost is bigger than the materials cost.

After cutting out the pieces, I started assembling them. The hat is made to the exact size of my head. I glued a band of cardboard, then foam padding, to the brim of the hat.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/band-gluing.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/foam-gluing-prepare.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/foam-gluing-finished.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;">
</div>

Then I attached the other pieces to the brim, making a complete hat! This hat has a fun feature: The roof and brim of the hat are attached to the wall by cardboard tabs in cardboard slots. You can pull out the tabs and collapse the whole hat into a much smaller space. This is useful for transporting it – for instance, I might need to collapse it to carry it by bicycle.

<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/hat-assembled.jpg?rr" alt="" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">

Then, I built the air-purifier box. It has a slot at one end for a pre-filter, and a slot at the other end for the HEPA filter. In between, there's a wall with a hole for the fan to mount. The fan blows air from one side to the other. All of the assembly (not counting cutting) only took about 1.5 hours, and was less hard on my hands.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/box-empty.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/box-pre-side.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/box-hepa-side.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;">
</div>

The box is also held into the top of the hat by cardboard tabs. It's just as removable as the other pieces. When it's in place, it pulls air from above my head and pushes filtered air inside the hat – where it eventually finds its way through the triangular holes above my face. So I simply inserted it into the slot, and…

<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/hat-wired.jpg?rr" alt="" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">

<p>...and it didn't quite work right.</p>

First of all, it came out too small for my head. Even though I took the thickness of the cardboard into account, I somehow didn't take it into account <em>enough</em>. So I ended up having to replace the foam padding with thinner foam, which didn't have as good a grip.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/oops-foam-too-tight.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/lighter-foam.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

Not only that, but even though I specifically remember measuring the hat's wall to 7 inches tall, I somehow ended up cutting it to 6 inches. So there was only barely enough room for both my head and the air purifier box.

But the main problem was that it just didn't seal well. Most of the filtered air ended up escaping through the corners of the hat, rather than going through the triangular air holes like I wanted. This wasn't <em>unexpected</em>, so I had planned to seal it by putting a layer of thin foam at the joints. The idea was that the cardboard would press into the foam, forming a pretty good seal. But in practice, the edges were too irregular, my cuts weren't exact enough, and the tab-in-slot design wasn't strong enough to press the cardboard into the foam anyway. And the air-purifier box's slot for the HEPA filter didn't have a good enough grip either, allowing unfiltered air to pass through.

I ended up trying to direct the air using a plastic bag, then building a differently-shaped air-purifier box.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/bag-airway.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/curved-box-filter-side.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/curved-box-fan-side.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;">
</div>

But neither of them was a magic solution. And then the USB cord stopped working again, and I had to rewire it again <em>again</em>. And then I ran into the limits of what my thumbs were up to, and took a break for a few days.

Since then, I've had some more design ideas that might work better. I'll get back to this project at some point, but for the meantime, I've been focusing on other projects instead.

This week, I've been hard at work on <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/time-steward">TimeSteward</a>, which I've <a href="/blog/eli-status-august-2016">briefly mentioned before</a>. My mind is pretty occupied with the design, so I don't have the energy to <em>explain</em> what I'm actually doing right now.

However, I've managed to <a href="/time-steward-examples/bouncy-circles">make the bouncy-circles example into a webpage!</a>

I've also been slowly working away at chapter 3 of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a>, and it currently stands at about 4500 words.

I missed last week's update because I was very busy, both working on <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/time-steward">TimeSteward</a>, which I've <a href="/blog/eli-status-august-2016">briefly mentioned before</a>, and some exhausting personal stuff.

I can explain a bit of my TimeSteward work now! Both <a href="/games/green-caves">the green caves game</a> and <a href="/time-steward-examples/bouncy-circles">the bouncy-circles example</a> are working examples of TimeSteward simulations, but they are both very simple. That's because I've only made prototypes of TimeSteward that <em>work</em>, but are not efficient. Complex simulations run too slowly.

My current work is fixing that. The old TimeSteward did a lot of extra computations tracking redundant dependencies, to make sure it works even if there are mistakes in the simulation design. In the new system I'm building right now, TimeSteward trusts the simulation to do its own tracking, in whichever way is the most efficient. To deal with mistakes, I'm making a way to <em>audit</em> the simulation after-the-fact to make sure there are no inconsistencies.

"title": "Consent and Conflictedness",
"tags": ["sex"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "",
"contents":'''

Suppose I have a friend who knows I'm interested in them sexually, but hasn't decided to do anything sexual with me before. One day, this friend comes up to me, obviously <strong>upset</strong>, and says they want to have sex with me. What should I do?

On one hand, I have an immediate feeling of "<em>this is wrong</em>". I feel like, while they're in this emotional state, doing anything would risk hurting them in the long-term. On the other hand, I believe that people have the right to choose what risks to take for themselves, and it feels wrong to say "I'm refusing for <em>your</em> sake" when they clearly indicated consent. When I was younger, a lot of adults did things that hurt me while saying they were helping me. I don't want to act like that towards anyone else.

I came up with this post while trying to reconcile those two feelings.

<h2>Parts of self</h2>

A person isn't a <cut>rigid box with fixed opinions about everything. Their outward beliefs may change based on how they're feeling or what context they're in. They may also have internal conflict, where they disagree with <em>themselves</em> about what to think.

It can help to model this as <em>parts of self</em>. Ideally, most parts of yourself agree about who you are and what you want. But there will always be parts that have different interests, or even disagree about what you, as a whole, should be doing. You could think of it as a sort of internal family argument, like this:

"I want ice cream!"

"But you know that when we eat ice cream, we get a headache. I don't want us to get a headache!"

"But I wanna!"

If this person does end up eating ice cream, the second part might feel angry or betrayed. It might come out in thoughts like "Why did I do that?! I'm angry at myself for eating the ice cream when I knew I'd get a headache." By thinking of these as separate <em>parts of self</em>, we can help them make compromises or set boundaries with each other, instead of escalating fighting.

When I was a teenager, I made an internal decision that I wouldn't make any big decisions without consensus from <em>all</em> of my parts of self. All parts of me agreed that they wouldn't take risks without consulting the rest of me first. This helped protect me from a lot of things. Not everyone can get to this ideal right away, but pretty much everyone can find some ways to <em>improve</em> their internal cooperation.

Anyway, this isn't a full post about "parts of self" theory. It's more about…

<h2>Interacting with <em>other</em> people who have internal conflict</h2>

I said I don't want to stop someone from taking a risk for <em>themselves</em>. But of course I would stop someone from risking harm to a <em>different</em> person. And if a person has internal conflict, it's like they're two different people. I wouldn't necessarily let one part harm the other part just because it wanted to.

In my example, the friend probably has a lot of internal conflict. One part of them has a lot of desire, and <em>that part</em> is obviously giving consent. But what about the other parts? At the very least, I should stop my friend and try communicating with them. "If we do this, how will you feel about it tomorrow? In a week? Since you've never wanted to do this before, I assumed you weren't comfortable doing it – was I wrong? Has that changed?"

There are three general ways this can go:
<ol class="big_list">
<li>"Oh crap, you're right. I'd feel terrible tomorrow."<br><br>Result: Hooray! I helped my friend communicate with themselves and make the best decision.</li>
<li>"Actually, I've been wanting this for a while, I just never found the right time to bring it up. Being upset today just made me finally think – what am I waiting for?"<br><br>Result: It worked out! It looks like I actually do have consent from all parts of them. And getting that out in the open may prevent more miscommunications in the future.</li>
<li>"I don't care! I want this <em>now</em>, why are you hesitating?"<br><br>Result: Uh oh. The currently-active part of my friend is refusing to give the other parts a voice, probably because it knows they won't be okay with it. I have to stand my ground. "Look, I'm your friend and I want you to be happy, but I'm <em>also</em> the friend of the 'you' of tomorrow and the 'you' of next week. I'm not going to do something if I think it will make them feel bad."
</ol>

<h2>If the conflict continues</h2>

"But," you say, "what if I'm a part of self who wants to have sex, but I share my body with another part that <em>never</em> wants to have sex? Are you saying that nobody should ever have sex with me because the other part doesn't consent?"

Well, that's a more difficult problem.

Consent is a scale, where you should try to get <em>as much consent as possible</em> in order to <em>minimize</em> the risk of hurting someone. Some things are definitely abuse, but even if you have enough consent that it's not abuse, that doesn't necessarily mean everything's fine. That's why you shouldn't accept consent from drunk people, even though some people are pretty alert when they're drunk. Maybe you can get tolerable consent from that drunk person, but it wouldn't be too hard for you to wait until they're not drunk, and get <em>better</em> consent.

With someone who has long-term internal conflict, there might not be such an easy way to get better consent. So unlike with the drunk person, I can't say "Aha, you shouldn't do that, because this other way is so much better!" It's a difficult problem. But I <em>do</em> know that it's worth a lot of work to try to solve this problem.

Do the communication work. Try to help the person develop a better relationship with themselves, so they can find arrangements that all parts of themselves can accept.
