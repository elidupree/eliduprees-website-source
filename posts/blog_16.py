The same day I finished <a href="/blog/saddlebags-2-0">Saddlebags 2.0</a>, we had a great idea for how to improve the design:

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/saddlebags-2-1-demo-1.jpg?rr" alt="[Photo: Me, wearing Saddlebags 2.1 around my hips. They are two cardboard boxes at my sides, connected by a strap.]" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 52%;"><img src="/media/saddlebags-2-1-demo-2.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 47%;">
</div>

I didn't actually need a clever system to keep the pouches from swinging. The swinging was only a problem when they could slap against the <em>fronts</em> of my legs while I ran. But these boxes are always flat at my sides, so they don't get in the way.

I can comfortably run and bicycle while carrying 10 pounds (4.5kg) of encyclopedias in these. They also held up to walking with a load of 25 pounds (11 kg). These pouches are slightly smaller, so I didn't go up to the 32 pounds I tried in 2.0, just because it was hard to fit that much stuff in them.

<img src="/media/saddlebags-2-1-demo-3.jpg?rr" alt="[Photo: a pile of corrugated cardboard in various shapes.]" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">

Compared to 2.0, these are much more <cut>convenient:
<ul>
<li>They are slimmer (when I wear them, they're 24 inches wide instead of 28). This makes it much easier to fit through doors.</li>
<li>When I'm not wearing them, I can fit them in a much smaller space. This will be important when I ride trains or buses. I can just put the two pouches in my lap instead of taking up extra seat space.</li>
<li>They're adjustable. I don't have to worry if the size will be right if I'm wearing bulky clothing, or if my body changes size over time. And when I start selling them to other people, the same design can work for all sizes of people.</li>
</ul>

Like in <a href="/blog/the-carrying-contraption">Saddlebags 1.0</a>, there's a strap in the front, but it's important that the front strap doesn't actually touch my waist. Any pressure on the front of my waist makes me feel uncomfortable if it stays there for a while. So I designed these to <em>only</em> put pressure on my hips.

<h2>Next steps</h2>

A <em>lot</em> of people have suggested I sell these to people, so I'm seriously considering it. But I'm not ready to sell them <em>quite</em> yet.

For one thing, I have no experience doing this! It's a little daunting. How do I market them? How do I take payments? How do I ship them? What legal regulations do I need to worry about? I know I can figure this stuff out, but there's just so <em>much</em> of it. If any of you have sold things before, I could use your advice.

Also, there are a bunch of design things I still need to polish:

<ul class="big_list">
<li>The pouches need to be protected from rain. I plan to add a lid and cover them with waterproof contact paper. (The contact paper doubles as a way to decorate them with nice designs!) I also want to make the top of each pouch have a slight slant away from the body, so that rain is shed outwards instead of pooling on the lids and/or pouring onto your body. I'm confident I can make this work, but I'll have to do some math to shape the supporting pieces correctly.</li>
<li>I want to build some slightly smaller boxes to organize the stuff <em>in</em> the pouches. Each one will have a small compartment just under the top lid of the box, and a larger compartment below it. That way, you can store small things at the top, then grab them easily without having to dig through the whole box. Or you can pull the organizing-box out of the pouch and open it from the side, for easy access to the bigger stuff. Or something like that.</li>
<li>The foam pads don't stay on very well. The glue doesn't fail, but the foam itself can easily tear apart if you pull on the corners. And that happens every time you put them on. For <em>myself</em>, I can just be careful and/or keep re-taping them, but if I want to sell them, I should make them more user-friendly. I need to change the design so they don't get pulled on, and/or find a tougher type of padding to use.</li>
<li>Cutting out the cardboard is too much work for me currently. I can make a few prototypes, but building a lot of them would be too much for my hands. I'll need a different way to make the pieces. For the smaller pieces, I can reasonably pay a laser-cutting service. For the boxes, laser cutting might be inefficient because they're much larger. There are companies that sell cardboard boxes in bulk, but these are an unusual shape. I haven't found a place to buy 12"x12"x3" boxes that open on one of the narrow sides. I'll need to investigate things more.</li>
<li>Right now, the strap is just a plain strap with a rolling hitch tied in it. I'm not sure this is secure enough. I should probably use a strap with a cam buckle in it.</li>
<li>One hip support started bending under the weight of 25 pounds. I had just copied the hip support design from Saddlebags 2.0. But the 2.0 hip supports weren't designed to resist force compressing them from the front and back, and 2.1 relies on them being strong in that direction. I'll need to adjust the design to take care of that.</li>
</ul>

So I have a lot of stuff to work out. But I'm very happy with what I've got so far, and I'm definitely planning to keep going with it.

"blurb_image": "/media/allergy-hat-2/hat-assembled.jpg?rr",
"contents":'''
A few weeks ago, I built <a href="/blog/projects-update-2017-06-21">a top hat that is also an air purifier</a>. Last week, I stated building a second one. I wanted to improve on the design, and take photos of the process to show to the rest of you.

I was hoping for this to be a triumphant post about how I built a great hat, but, well… you'll see.

<h2>Materials</h2>
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-all.jpg?rr" alt="[Photo: a pile of various materials, described below.]" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<ul>
<li>A bunch of scrap cardboard.</li>
<li>Cloth with a flowery pattern, to cover the finished hat.</li>
<li>A bit of an old sleeping pad.</li>
<li>A USB cord with one end missing.</li>
<li>A 5V 40mm static pressure fan (NF-A4x20 5V).</li>
<li>A 6"x4" HEPA filter.</li>
<li>A box of cut-to-fit pre-filter, which I cut to the same size as the HEPA filter.</li>
<li>Some thin nonporous foam, for making things airtight.</li>
<li>Some white glue.</li>
<li>Some clear packing tape.</li>
</ul>

Out of these materials, my only significant costs were for the fan (about $16) and <cut>the HEPA filter (about $4). I got the rest by taking bits of old things we had in storage. If you didn't have any of the materials to start out with, it would have a much bigger up-front cost.

I also used a lot of tools – scissors, rulers, clothespins, utility knives, and more.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-various.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-tools.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

<h2>Building process</h2>

First, I turned the 3-pin fan into a USB fan. Standard USB connectors output 5-volt power, and can supply up to 0.1 amps without any fancy electrics. This particular fan is specced to run on <em>exactly</em> 5V/0.1A, so turning it into a USB fan was just a matter of connecting the wires. And the fan came with small crimp connectors that were very convenient to use.
<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-USB-fan.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/USB-cord-assembly.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/USB-cord-finished.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;">
</div>

Oops! The old USB cord I was using actually didn't work. I had to take it apart and rewire it. But I eventually did get it to run off an actual USB port.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/USB-cord-repaired.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/USB-fan-running.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

For the next step, I had to cut out all of the cardboard pieces. I printed out paper templates for all the pieces, and attached them to the cardboard so that I could cut them precisely.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/materials-templates.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/prepared-for-cutting.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

To cut the cardboard, I mostly used utility knives, with the cardboard resting on a homemade jig that I made out of cardboard and styrofoam. The jig holds a metal straightedge in a good place so that I can cut along the straightedge with a utility knife.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/jig-setup.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/jig-cutting.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

Alas, I forgot to photograph all the cardboard pieces after I cut them out.

Cutting the cardboard took me a total of 2.75 hours. Since I've been toying with the idea of making more of these to sell, I've been thinking about the practicalities of making multiple hats. Nearly 3 hours of cutting alone is impractical for me. Doubly so because I have to be careful with my hands, due to my old injury. Counting the time I spent <em>resting</em>, the total was much more.

I could probably have this whole design cut by a laser-cutting service for about $25, which would be much more efficient. Either way, the cutting cost is bigger than the materials cost.

After cutting out the pieces, I started assembling them. The hat is made to the exact size of my head. I glued a band of cardboard, then foam padding, to the brim of the hat.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/band-gluing.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/foam-gluing-prepare.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/foam-gluing-finished.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;">
</div>

Then I attached the other pieces to the brim, making a complete hat! This hat has a fun feature: The roof and brim of the hat are attached to the wall by cardboard tabs in cardboard slots. You can pull out the tabs and collapse the whole hat into a much smaller space. This is useful for transporting it – for instance, I might need to collapse it to carry it by bicycle.

<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/hat-assembled.jpg?rr" alt="" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">

Then, I built the air-purifier box. It has a slot at one end for a pre-filter, and a slot at the other end for the HEPA filter. In between, there's a wall with a hole for the fan to mount. The fan blows air from one side to the other. All of the assembly (not counting cutting) only took about 1.5 hours, and was less hard on my hands.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/box-empty.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/box-pre-side.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/box-hepa-side.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;">
</div>

The box is also held into the top of the hat by cardboard tabs. It's just as removable as the other pieces. When it's in place, it pulls air from above my head and pushes filtered air inside the hat – where it eventually finds its way through the triangular holes above my face. So I simply inserted it into the slot, and…

<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/hat-wired.jpg?rr" alt="" style="display:block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">

<p>...and it didn't quite work right.</p>

First of all, it came out too small for my head. Even though I took the thickness of the cardboard into account, I somehow didn't take it into account <em>enough</em>. So I ended up having to replace the foam padding with thinner foam, which didn't have as good a grip.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/oops-foam-too-tight.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/lighter-foam.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 50%;">
</div>

Not only that, but even though I specifically remember measuring the hat's wall to 7 inches tall, I somehow ended up cutting it to 6 inches. So there was only barely enough room for both my head and the air purifier box.

But the main problem was that it just didn't seal well. Most of the filtered air ended up escaping through the corners of the hat, rather than going through the triangular air holes like I wanted. This wasn't <em>unexpected</em>, so I had planned to seal it by putting a layer of thin foam at the joints. The idea was that the cardboard would press into the foam, forming a pretty good seal. But in practice, the edges were too irregular, my cuts weren't exact enough, and the tab-in-slot design wasn't strong enough to press the cardboard into the foam anyway. And the air-purifier box's slot for the HEPA filter didn't have a good enough grip either, allowing unfiltered air to pass through.

I ended up trying to direct the air using a plastic bag, then building a differently-shaped air-purifier box.

<div style=" margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/bag-airway.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/curved-box-filter-side.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;"><img src="/media/allergy-hat-2/curved-box-fan-side.jpg?rr" alt="" style="flex-shrink:1; display:inline-block; max-width: 33%;">
</div>

But neither of them was a magic solution. And then the USB cord stopped working again, and I had to rewire it again <em>again</em>. And then I ran into the limits of what my thumbs were up to, and took a break for a few days.

Since then, I've had some more design ideas that might work better. I'll get back to this project at some point, but for the meantime, I've been focusing on other projects instead.

This week, I've been hard at work on <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/time-steward">TimeSteward</a>, which I've <a href="/blog/eli-status-august-2016">briefly mentioned before</a>. My mind is pretty occupied with the design, so I don't have the energy to <em>explain</em> what I'm actually doing right now.

However, I've managed to <a href="/time-steward-examples/bouncy-circles">make the bouncy-circles example into a webpage!</a>

I've also been slowly working away at chapter 3 of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a>, and it currently stands at about 4500 words.

I missed last week's update because I was very busy, both working on <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/time-steward">TimeSteward</a>, which I've <a href="/blog/eli-status-august-2016">briefly mentioned before</a>, and some exhausting personal stuff.

I can explain a bit of my TimeSteward work now! Both <a href="/games/green-caves">the green caves game</a> and <a href="/time-steward-examples/bouncy-circles">the bouncy-circles example</a> are working examples of TimeSteward simulations, but they are both very simple. That's because I've only made prototypes of TimeSteward that <em>work</em>, but are not efficient. Complex simulations run too slowly.

My current work is fixing that. The old TimeSteward did a lot of extra computations tracking redundant dependencies, to make sure it works even if there are mistakes in the simulation design. In the new system I'm building right now, TimeSteward trusts the simulation to do its own tracking, in whichever way is the most efficient. To deal with mistakes, I'm making a way to <em>audit</em> the simulation after-the-fact to make sure there are no inconsistencies.

"blurb": "Ideally, most parts of yourself agree about who you are and what you want. But there will always be parts that have different interests, or even disagree about what you, as a whole, should be doing.",
"contents":'''

Suppose I have a friend who knows I'm interested in them sexually, but hasn't decided to do anything sexual with me before. One day, this friend comes up to me, obviously <strong>upset</strong>, and says they want to have sex with me. What should I do?

On one hand, I have an immediate feeling of "<em>this is wrong</em>". I feel like, while they're in this emotional state, doing anything would risk hurting them in the long-term. On the other hand, I believe that people have the right to choose what risks to take for themselves, and it feels wrong to say "I'm refusing for <em>your</em> sake" when they clearly indicated consent. When I was younger, a lot of adults did things that hurt me while saying they were helping me. I don't want to act like that towards anyone else.

I came up with this post while trying to reconcile those two feelings.

<h2>Parts of self</h2>

A person isn't a <cut>rigid box with fixed opinions about everything. Their outward beliefs may change based on how they're feeling or what context they're in. They may also have internal conflict, where they disagree with <em>themselves</em> about what to think.

It can help to model this as <em>parts of self</em>. Ideally, most parts of yourself agree about who you are and what you want. But there will always be parts that have different interests, or even disagree about what you, as a whole, should be doing. You could think of it as a sort of internal family argument, like this:

"I want ice cream!"

"But you know that when we eat ice cream, we get a headache. I don't want us to get a headache!"

"But I wanna!"

If this person does end up eating ice cream, the second part might feel angry or betrayed. It might come out in thoughts like "Why did I do that?! I'm angry at myself for eating the ice cream when I knew I'd get a headache." By thinking of these as separate <em>parts of self</em>, we can help them make compromises or set boundaries with each other, instead of escalating fighting.

When I was a teenager, I made an internal decision that I wouldn't make any big decisions without consensus from <em>all</em> of my parts of self. All parts of me agreed that they wouldn't take risks without consulting the rest of me first. This helped protect me from a lot of things. Not everyone can get to this ideal right away, but pretty much everyone can find some ways to <em>improve</em> their internal cooperation.

Anyway, this isn't a full post about "parts of self" theory. It's more about…

<h2>Interacting with <em>other</em> people who have internal conflict</h2>

I said I don't want to stop someone from taking a risk for <em>themselves</em>. But of course I would stop someone from risking harm to a <em>different</em> person. And if a person has internal conflict, it's like they're two different people. I wouldn't necessarily let one part harm the other part just because it wanted to.

In my example, the friend probably has a lot of internal conflict. One part of them has a lot of desire, and <em>that part</em> is obviously giving consent. But what about the other parts? At the very least, I should stop my friend and try communicating with them. "If we do this, how will you feel about it tomorrow? In a week? Since you've never wanted to do this before, I assumed you weren't comfortable doing it – was I wrong? Has that changed?"

There are three general ways this can go:
<ol class="big_list">
<li>"Oh crap, you're right. I'd feel terrible tomorrow."<br><br>Result: Hooray! I helped my friend communicate with themselves and make the best decision.</li>
<li>"Actually, I've been wanting this for a while, I just never found the right time to bring it up. Being upset today just made me finally think – what am I waiting for?"<br><br>Result: It worked out! It looks like I actually do have consent from all parts of them. And getting that out in the open may prevent more miscommunications in the future.</li>
<li>"I don't care! I want this <em>now</em>, why are you hesitating?"<br><br>Result: Uh oh. The currently-active part of my friend is refusing to give the other parts a voice, probably because it knows they won't be okay with it. I have to stand my ground. "Look, I'm your friend and I want you to be happy, but I'm <em>also</em> the friend of the 'you' of tomorrow and the 'you' of next week. I'm not going to do something if I think it will make them feel bad."
</ol>

<h2>If the conflict continues</h2>

"But," you say, "what if I'm a part of self who wants to have sex, but I share my body with another part that <em>never</em> wants to have sex? Are you saying that nobody should ever have sex with me because the other part doesn't consent?"

Well, that's a more difficult problem.

Consent is a scale, where you should try to get <em>as much consent as possible</em> in order to <em>minimize</em> the risk of hurting someone. Some things are definitely abuse, but even if you have enough consent that it's not abuse, that doesn't necessarily mean everything's fine. That's why you shouldn't accept consent from drunk people, even though some people are pretty alert when they're drunk. Maybe you can get tolerable consent from that drunk person, but it wouldn't be too hard for you to wait until they're not drunk, and get <em>better</em> consent.

With someone who has long-term internal conflict, there might not be such an easy way to get better consent. So unlike with the drunk person, I can't say "Aha, you shouldn't do that, because this other way is so much better!" It's a difficult problem. But I <em>do</em> know that it's worth a lot of work to try to solve this problem.

Do the communication work. Try to help the person develop a better relationship with themselves, so they can find arrangements that all parts of themselves can accept.

I'd really like to be making real Wednesday posts for y'all, but I'm still on a roll with my huge project, <a href="/blog/eli-status-august-2016">TimeSteward</a>, and I don't want to mess it up. My mind is focusing on it really well, and I can't easily switch to focusing on a different project. (In general, I'm sometimes able to switch projects by choice, but not always.) And between my hand issues and throat issues, it's been a long time since I've had the chance to be this productive, so I want to make the most of this.

Unfortunately, most of it is still arcane computer stuff that I can't exhibit in a cool way. I did made a better version of the <a href="/time-steward-examples/simple-diffusion">simple diffusion example</a>, but I can't show it to you today because of technical difficulties.

In school, they taught me that humans have five senses: sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste.

This is silly. We have many more wonderful senses than that. Some people like to say <q>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">proprioception</a>!</q>, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Lately, I've been trying to notice all the various ways I perceive the world.

With my lungs, I can perceive a lot of things about the air in my environment. I can tell the difference between very humid air and dry air. I can sense certain pollutants when I feel nausea, even without smelling them directly. If my airways are blocked, I can feel the low pressure inside my lungs when I try to breathe in, and the high pressure when I try to breathe out.

When I eat something, my digestive system gives me information about which nutrients were in it. Is it satisfying? Does it feel <cut>good in my stomach? Does it give me energy, and for how long? The tongue is part of this, but not all of it. We humans aren't born knowing exactly which foods will be filling. Many of our feelings about taste sensations are <em>created</em> by information from further down the digestive system.

Inside my body, I can feel how much work each of my muscles is doing. My muscles can feel the difference between moving freely, being blocked, and being pulled taut. Even if I was deprived of my sight, hearing, and every sense of my skin, I could theoretically learn to navigate obstacles using my internal muscle senses alone.<footnote((What I'm describing here is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">proprioception</a>. But this post is my description of it based on my own observations, before I looked it up. Also, some people group this together with "touch" as the "somatosensory system", but that seems like a totally unjustified grouping – "somato" just means "body", so I guess "somatosensory system" means "all the senses that aren't unique to the head". That just doesn't seem like a "single sense" to me. Plus, it apparently doesn't include the intestines, even though they're not in the head and are useful for perceiving the external world.))>

With my inner ear, I can perceive the force of the ground holding me up against gravity.<footnote((Haha, this isn't generally how people describe our sense of balance. But it's technically the <em>specific external force that's being perceived</em> by the system. Gravity itself accelerates the whole body evenly, so we have no way of sensing it – that's why being in free-fall in the atmosphere is similar to being in outer space. The only thing we can actually sense is the <em>difference</em> between the local gravity and some point of reference, like the ground holding us up.))> And also whether I'm spinning.

"Touch" sounds so simple. My skin is much more interesting than that. I have pressure sense and vibration sense and warm sense and cold sense. I can sense the difference between warm air and warm sunlight through the pattern of heating on my skin. I can even sense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV-B">UV-B</a> exposure specifically if I wait long enough to notice whether it makes my skin irritated. But – and I also find this very interesting – I <em>don't</em> have a specific skin-sense for water. I have to guess whether something is wet based on its appearance, weight, and temperature response.

There are just so many senses to notice! And I haven't even listed perceptions of internal state, like sleepiness. For this post, I restricted myself to senses that can be used to examine the external world.

Our senses are important to us, so it's good if we can have a full understanding of them. And the idea of "five senses" isn't just a simplification – it's plain inaccurate. I hope that one day, the idea of "five senses" will be as archaic as the idea of <q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_humors">four humors</a></q>.

I've written a lot of <a href="/stories">stories</a>, and a lot of <a href="/blog/tags/writing">blog posts about writing them</a>. I didn't learn my writing skills in school – I developed them on my own.

How did I do it? This post will explain. Maybe it can help you develop your own skills, too.

<h2>My general approach</h2>

Many writers think of writing as a mystical activity. Their words come from a metaphorical "muse", whose methods are unknowable. I am the opposite. I like to say "I'm not an artist, I'm an art engineer!" I want to understand the structure of prose in detail – how all the elements work, and how <cut>they fit together.

Also, I'm talking about <strong>words</strong>. For this post, I don't really care about <a href="/blog/how-to-write-cliffhangers-a-theory-of-writing">plot</a>, setting, <a href=" positive-and-negative-characterization">characterization</a>, and all that stuff. Words are the most important thing, because if your words don't get your point across, none of that other stuff will make a difference. Specifically, I'm going to focus on <strong>studying individual sentences</strong>.

There are countless variations on any sentence, and even if the literal meaning is the same, you can make totally different impressions on the reader. So I want to be able to look at a sentence and say, "What impression does this sentence make?" and "If I write this sentence differently, what other impressions can I make?"

Here are some exercises for studying those things.

<h2>Writing with a restriction</h2>

Maybe you've seen some of these writing challenges before:

<ul>
<li>Write a story that's entirely dialogue.</li>
<li>Write a conversation that's entirely questions.</li>
<li>Write without using the letter <em>e</em>.</li>
<li>Write a story about a conversation, but without using dialogue or mentioning exactly what anyone <em>said</em>.</li>
<li>Write using only the 1000 most common words of English.</li>
<li>Write a character who wants to know something, but they can't ask any questions.</li>
</ul>

Restrictions are useful because they <em>force you to learn new techniques</em>. When you get to a place where you'd <em>normally</em> use the forbidden thing, you end up searching for a new way to write. That searching is the key ingredient for learning.

The best restrictions are ones that you choose <em>yourself</em>. If you want to learn more about something, forbid the way you usually do it. For example: Suppose I want my writing to <strong>express a sense of urgency</strong>. I <em>could</em> write,

"I had to get these results to the lab immediately! I jumped up from my chair and ran down the street as fast as I could."

But that's just <em>one</em> way of doing it, and I want to learn more. So I tell myself, "write that again – but this time, you're not allowed to use any words that express speed or time by themselves."

"I scattered the papers from my desk and jumped up–"

Nope, can't use "jumped", because that word expresses speed (at least when used in the "jumping up from a chair" sense, rather than the "standing jump" sense).

"I scattered the papers from my desk. I was at the door in moments–" Nope, "moments" is time. "I was at the door before–" Nope, "before" is also time. "I was at the door when–" Also time. At this point, I had to ponder for a while.

"I scattered the papers from my desk. This was it! I was up on my feet, and the door swung closed behind me on the tail end of Yeason's surprised yell. Up the street, down the block, there was only one thought in my mind – <em>get to the lab</em>."

What did I learn from this?

<ul>
<li>Include an action that someone would <em>do</em> if they were in a hurry – scattering papers.</li>
<li><em>Skip</em> some moments that are less important – the narrator skips straight from the desk, to the door, to down the street, as if they're in too much of a hurry to even describe each step.</li>
<li>Include something that only <em>could</em> happen if it was very fast – being out the door while someone is still yelling.</li>
<li>Skip some <em>structure words</em> too. "Up the street, down the block," actually ends up sounding <em>more</em> urgent than "I ran up the street and down the block."</li>
<li>Emphasize the <em>objective</em> the narrator is rushing towards – exactly what would be on someone's mind when they're in a hurry.</li>
</ul>

And these techniques will be useful even once I go back to writing a normal story, where I'm allowed to use the word "when".

When I study by using a restriction, I never write a whole story that way. One sentence or one paragraph is usually enough to learn a lot. If I keep writing, I'll just keep using the techniques I used to write the first paragraph, rather than learning more new ones. So if I still want to continue studying, I just write another, different paragraph. Sometimes I do it by adding an <em>additional</em> restriction, banning the technique I used the first time, so that I have to find yet another technique.

<h2>Ordering</h2>


"I rushed into the room carrying the new evidence, quietly, hoping no one would notice I was late."

Notice the progression of this sentence. "Rushing" is normally conspicuous, so the reader may assume it was conspicuous until they get the later words correcting that. Here's the sentence again, translated into what someone might assume while reading it:

"I rushed into the room, loudly, waving around my new evidence for everyone to see. No, that's not what happened. I actually came in quietly, hoping no one would notice I was late."

This <em>usually</em> isn't what you're trying to write. When I write, I often reorder sentences a lot, to make sure the halfway-read meaning is still something I want to say. Here's a simple reordering:

"Quietly, hoping no one would notice I was late, I rushed into the room carrying the new evidence."

This isn't exactly what I wanted either. It's not <em>wrong</em>, but now the <em>evidence</em> is inserted after-the-fact, even though it's important to the whole action. I think I actually want the order "evidence – quietly – into room – fast – details." So how about...

"Carrying the new evidence, quietly, into the room, I rushed, hoping no one would notice I was late."

Oops. Sometimes you have to rephrase things in order to reorder them. Let's try again:

"Gripping the new evidence in my hands, I slipped into the back of the room as quickly as I could, hoping no one would notice I was late."

I'm much happier with this!

Since I've practiced this a lot, I often get an order I like on the first try. But I still often look back at a sentence to see if there's a better order. There's always more to learn.

Note that ordering choices aren't necessarily <em>right</em> or <em>wrong</em> – sometimes, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence">tricky sentence</a> may actually create the impression you <em>want</em> to create, especially if you're writing something humorous. And writing tricky sentences on purpose can be another good way to study.

<h2>Playing with style</h2>

I could write this:

"It was dark and rainy, so I stupidly slipped and fell down a hole into a cave."

Or, I could write this:

"On a stormy night, a foolish mortal tumbled down a crevice into the bowels of the Earth."

Or this:

"Man, what a fuckin' day that was. I was soaked through and I couldn't see for shit, so like a dumbass, I just <em>had</em> to trip over summin', an', next thing I knew, I was half-a-way down the ass-crack of the Earth."

They're all good sentences, and they mean about the same thing! But they are <em>oh so different</em> from each other.

I often play around with a sentence like this, translating it into many different styles. This helps me notice what makes the difference between the styles, so that I can choose exactly the style I want for each of my own stories. That way, I'll be prepared whether I want to write an <a href="/stories/capitalism-sat">over-the-top fable</a>, a <a href="/ravelling-wrath">first-person story of a casual teenager</a>, or a <a href="/stories/time-travelers-and-how-to-kill-them-a-practical-guide">document by a stuffy research organization</a>.

<h2>Other challenges</h2>

One of my favorite writing challenges I've done was this: write a very short story where <em>every</em> sentence is a paradigm shift. That is, every sentence changes the implications or meaning of the story up to that point as a whole.

That one could be very tricky. But there are lots of others. Write poetry with a strict meter, if you haven't. Now write a prose poem, to learn what really makes something poetic, independent of meter!

Write from the perspective of a character who's very different from you. Write a genre you normally don't write – like a hammy mystery story if you normally do psychological realism, or vice versa!

Just like with restrictions, writing challenges are best if you choose them for yourself. Pick one that intrigues you, or come up with your own! The one thing I'd suggest is to keep them short. The shorter they are, the more you can pay attention to every detail.

<h2>But I want to write fast!</h2>

So far, this whole post has been about <strong>study</strong>. When you study, you can spend an hour dissecting a single sentence, to help you learn about it. If you want to write a novel, you can't do that for every sentence. So you need to take some shortcuts.

Fortunately, study isn't just a machine where you put in X hours of work and get out X perfect sentences. Through the <em>process</em> of study, you learn things that will come to mind quickly when you need them later.

When I write a story, I don't analyze every sentence (unless the story is only a few sentences long). Instead, <strong>before</strong> I start writing, I develop a <strong>voice</strong> for the story.

I would write more about developing a voice here, but this post has gone on long enough for now. Maybe another time!

"title": "About grouping mental illness with violence...",
"tags": ["philosophical"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "For a long time, I've had two conflicting ideas, and I've been looking for a way to reconcile them:",
"contents":'''

<p>(Content warning: Discussion of abusive relationships and other violence.)</p>

For a long time, I've had two conflicting ideas, and I've been looking for a way to reconcile them:

<ol class="big_list">
<li>When we're talking about abusers and spree killers, we shouldn't call them "psychos". We shouldn't call them mentally ill in general, because that stigmatizes mental illness. Mentally ill people are disproportionately the targets of violence, rather than the perpetrators. If you imply that they're violent, that isolates them further and prevents them from getting the care they need. So we should treat violence and mental illness as completely separate issues.</li>

<li><a href="/blog/bad-actions-and-punishment">Punishment</a> isn't the most effective way to reduce violence. As a society, we should take an epidemiological approach to violence. We should research the causes of violent behavior and remove those causes, rather than just punishing individual people who did violent things. In a sense, we should treat most violence as mental illness.</li>
</ol>

Obviously, these two beliefs have a conflict of each other. But yesterday, I finally found a way to reconcile them.

The difference is <cut><strong>rejection of the person</strong>. When people hear of a violent attack, they may think things like:
<ul>
<li>That person is a monster.</li>
<li>That person is nothing like me.</li>
<li>People like that should be punished.</li>
<li>People like that don't deserve care.</li>
<li>We need to stay away from people like that.</li>
</ul>
We certainly don't want them thinking those things about mentally ill people. So, Idea 1 is a pragmatic response to that.

But those responses aren't necessarily a good approach to violence, either! It's just shunning. If we could identify all of the violent people, shun them, and neglect their needs, would they become less violent? Of course not! <a href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-13/politics/raise-the-crime-rate/">It's being tried, and it's not working.</a> To actually stop violence from happening in the first place, we'll need different treatments. And they will probably look less like punishment, and more like care.

So as it turns out, my two "conflicting" ideas are very similar. Idea 1 says "don't treat mentally ill people in the bad way we treat violent people", and Idea 2 says "don't treat violent people in the bad way we treat violent people, either". (Of course, Idea 1 may still be pragmatic for an audience that isn't ready for Idea 2.)

So, what would this "care" look like? I don't have all the answers, but I do have a few. Economic insecurity makes people more violent, so guarantee food and housing to everyone. Emotional isolation makes people more violent, so teach children of all genders to take care of each other's emotional needs. And when an individual does harm someone, offer to help them learn how to stop, rather than saying "If you harm others, you're a bad person and you should be shunned." After all, if someone is physically sick, they may harm others by spreading the disease. Should we say "what a terrible person"? No, we should say "You poor thing! Let's provide a doctor to treat you, and/or send you home to rest." If someone is starving, they may harm others by taking their food. Should we say "what a terrible person"? No, we should say "You poor thing! Let's make sure no one goes hungry." What if we could treat violence the same way? Imagine a world where <a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/02/be-accountable-when-abusive/">working with abusers</a> is not only <em>done</em>, but <em>generally expected</em>. A world where someone might say "Oh no, I actually hit someone today! My violence is getting bad, I should go to the doctor."

"But," you say, "most abusers aren't looking for help stopping! They just make excuses and keep doing it!" But how can someone reach out for help if they've never seen that "getting help" is something you can actually <em>do</em>? If the only other model I've seen is "I am a terrible person", of <em>course</em> I'm going to reject that model! Or, if I admit that I'm a terrible person, what do I do? My society's main remedy for "being a terrible person" is to perform extreme acts of atonement, but atonement doesn't necessarily fix the source of the problem at all. It might even just make me a more effective abuser, by manipulating my victim's feelings even though I'm still hurting them. (Atonement can be worthwhile in some situations, but it's not a cure-all.)

This is why I prefer the "disease" model. When you have a disease, you know that there's something bad inside of you that is harming both yourself and (possibly) others, and you want to get rid of it. But you don't think "I am a bad person and should be punished", or "This is just how I am and it can't be fixed", or "I must perform excessive atonement". <em>You just want to get rid of it.</em> That's the approach I think people should generally take to their own harmful behavior.

Now, I should clarify, if you're the one who's <em>being</em> hurt, you're under no obligation to heal the person who's hurting you. It's probably better to focus on protecting yourself. But if you're in a position of power, either in a personal relationship or in a social institution, things are different. In that case, helping people to reduce their own violence may be something you can do. It's something I try to do in my own relationships when I can.
