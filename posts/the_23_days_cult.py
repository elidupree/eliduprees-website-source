"Today, at approximately 11 AM, a 32-year-old man was found stabbed to death in a department in the city of..."

<p><em>Day in, day out, the same news,</em> thought Light Yagami. <em>The media distract us with heart-wrenching stories about petty crimes and individual murders. Meanwhile, the real villains cause countless deaths through climate change and war, and only get rewarded.  This world is… rotten.</em></p>

<p><em>And it seems no one can stop it. Even when a powerful person has an attack of conscience, they will only be replaced by another.</em></p>

But then it happened. One day, in class &ndash; only half paying attention, as usual, staring out the window, as usual &ndash; Light saw a notebook fall past the classroom window and land in the grass.

<p><em>Strange. Why would someone drop a notebook from an third-floor window? Could it be an accident? Or were they trying to get rid of it? But people could easily see it outside… Wait &ndash; what if some bullies were trying to look in someone's private journal, and ze threw it outside to stop them?</em></p>

<p><em>Either way, I should check it out after class. It's better if I get there first, rather than someone who would do something unethical with it. I might look bad if its owner sees me take it, but I can always just give it back without a fuss.</em></p>

So, walking outside after class, Light remembered the notebook. Ze turned away from the regular sidewalk and looked in the grass for where it must have fallen.

On the front cover, it said, <strong style="font-variant: small-caps">Death Note</strong>.

<p><em>Spooky. I can see why someone might not want to be caught with this. Still, I should probably return it. I guess I should open the cover to see if they wrote their name?</em></p>

Light opened the notebook to the first page. But there was no name there. There was only this:

<div class="death_note_page">
<div style="text-align: center;">DEATH NOTE<BR>How to use it<BR>I<BR>
</div>

<ul>
<li>The human whose name is written in this note shall die.</li>

<li>This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.</li>

<li>If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the subject's name, it will happen.</li>

<li>If the cause of death is not specified, the subject will simply die of a heart attack.</li>

<li>After writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds (400 seconds).</li>

</ul>

</div>

<p><em>Someone actually wrote down a detailed system for killing people? This is seriously disturbing. Should I report this? No… if someone really wrote this because they have a lot of resentment for other people, reporting it would just give them more reason to believe that everyone is against them. Wait… if this is someone who has been hurt by other people, maybe that means I should actually <strong>help</strong> them? Approach them myself? But I still don't even know who they are. And it <strong>could</strong> just be someone who enjoys creepy stuff. It's not wrong to enjoy creepy stuff.</em></p>

Light nervously put zir hand on the corner of the page. <em>I guess I should check if they actually… wrote down any names of people to kill…</em>

But the next page was blank. Light flipped another page. That one was also blank. In fact, the entire rest of the notebook was blank.

<p><em>Well, that's a relief. Still… what do I do with this now? I don't know who the owner is, and they haven't showed up while I was thinking about it &ndash; or maybe &ndash; Light looked around quickly &ndash; maybe they <strong>did</strong> show up, but just didn't know they could trust me! I could just leave this here, so they can pick it up when I'm not looking. But then someone <strong>else</strong> might pick it up, and then that <strong>other</strong> person might report it! And if word gets out that someone found this "Death Note", anyone who <strong>saw</strong> the person drop it would be able to make the connection! I don't want to stop the owner from getting it back, but now I don't think I should take the risk of drawing any attention to it.</em></p>

<p><em>I guess I'd better hold on to this for now.</em></p>

Light stuck the notebook into zir bag and promptly forgot about it.

"I've been doing this all wrong," said Light.

"Hmmm?" rumbled Ryuk.

"I may be smart, but no one person can figure everything out on their own. I've known that this whole time. I just <em>assumed</em> that I couldn't trust anyone with knowledge of the Death Note. But then I remembered…" Light trailed off teasingly, waiting for Ryuk to ask.

Ryuk finally took the hint. "Remembered what?"

"That I have a magic book that can give me whatever I want."
