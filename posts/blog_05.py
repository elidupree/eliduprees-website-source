<p>I've been using the word "neurodiversity" a lot on this blog. I always meant to write a whole post about what it means to me. However, I hadn't gotten around to it until a reader asked me about it this afternoon.</p>

<p>It's finally time to write that post!</p>

<h2>What neurodiversity is</h2>

<p>The word "neurodiversity" means two different (but related) things.</p>

<p>The first meaning is the idea that different people's brains work differently. This is just a fact. Human brains have many variations. Some of them, we understand scientifically. Others, we don't.</p>

<p>The second meaning is the <strong>neurodiversity movement</strong>. This says that brain differences don't just <em>exist</em> â€“ they are natural and <cut>valuable.<footnote((A historical note: The word "neurodiversity" was first used in the autistic self-advocacy movement. Some people still use it to refer only (or mostly) to autism. "Neurodiversity" is obviously the right word for the broader ideas that I'm describing in this post, so if you don't think it means that already, I hereby steal it.))> It says we should support people with all different kinds of brains. Sometimes, brain differences come with problems, and we should find good ways to handle those problems. Sometimes, they come with advantages, and we should make good use of those advantages. Usually, they come with both.</p>

<p>Our society labels some ways of thinking as "normal". When we talk about people who think in a "normal" way, we say they are <strong>neurotypical</strong>. When we talk about people who think in a way that's labeled "not normal", we say they are <strong>neurovariant</strong> or <strong>neurodivergent</strong>. These aren't rigid categories, though. Different cultures have different opinions about what's "normal". It can change from place to place or generation to generation. Also, some traits, like autism, exist on a spectrum. A person can be more autistic or less autistic. If a person only has a few autistic traits, it's not obvious whether to call zem "neurovariant" or "neurotypical". These words are more useful for talking about general categories. If you want to find out how to describe a specific person, the best way is to ask them.</p>

<p>Discrimination against neurovariant people is called <strong>neurelitism</strong>, <strong>mentalism</strong>, or <strong>sanism</strong>. These are umbrella terms. They include all kinds of brain differences. They can apply to both major and minor issues.</p>

<h2>What neurodiversity implies</h2>

<p>Neurodiversity means asking your friends how they feel. You might sometimes be able to tell by looking at their face or their body language, but that doesn't always work. So ask. And if they tell you something that seems unnatural to you, trust them. Don't assume that they are dishonest or deluded.<footnote((Especially because, when people lie about themselves, they usually choose lies that sound natural to most people.))></p>

<p>Neurodiversity means planning activities that appeal to introverts as well as extroverts. Huge, noisy gatherings appeal to some people. Small, quiet ones appeal to others. It means that acting like an extrovert is not the only form of "happiness". It means not telling people what they are "supposed" to want.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means accepting that not everyone will take part in every activity. Imagine you're hosting a party, or teaching a class, or running a conference. It's okay to propose a "fun" activity or an "icebreaker" game, but if someone says ze doesn't want to play, that's it. You must immediately accept that and move on, even if you don't think ze "has a good reason" to avoid the game. When you're dividing up work, neurodiversity means being ready to compromise and seek alternate solutions. Some things that are easy for you can be hard for others. Neurodiversity means not saying that a person is lazy if ze is too depressed to work, or that a person is selfish if ze can't do a certain task because of past trauma. It means accepting all of those things <em>even if ze hasn't told you exactly what the problem is</em>. It's not zir job to tell you zir psychological profile before you respect zem. Sometimes ze might not even be able to explain the issue in a way that you understand.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means understanding that even if something doesn't hurt you, it can still hurt others. You might be able to ignore flickering lights, or background noise, or <em>lack</em> of background noise, or the smell of perfume, or the presence of cats or dogs. For some people, those things are overwhelming, or interfere with their ability to function. Neurodiversity means accommodating other people's needs, even if you can't see those needs.</em>

<p>Neurodiversity means giving trigger warnings before talking about things that can be traumatic. You usually don't know whether people are struggling with PTSD or self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Trigger warnings or content notices give them the chance to prepare, or to avoid the topic when they need to. It's better to let them <em>choose</em> when to engage, by giving notices, rather than to bring it up unexpectedly or to avoid difficult subjects entirely.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not making too many assumptions. It means not saying a person is "stupid" just because ze has trouble using a language. It means not saying a person is "immature" just because ze gets upset when you disrupt zir routine. It also means not assuming that a person <em>doesn't</em> have a mental disability just because you don't notice anything unusual about zem.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means recognizing that brain differences are often good. Some traits are labeled as "mental illnesses", "disabilities", or "disorders". However, it's up to each individual person to decide whether those labels fit. Neurodiversity means not calling a person's trait a "disability" unless ze calls it a disability zemself. It means not trying to "cure" someone if ze doesn't ask for it. It means valuing the perspectives of autistic people <em>and</em> allistic (non-autistic) people, extroverts <em>and</em> introverts, trans people <em>and</em> cis people, people with strong empathy <em>and</em> people with no empathy, sexuals <em>and</em> asexuals, multiples <em>and</em> singlets, people with spiritual instincts <em>and</em> those without.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not judging people for their feelings, even if you think those feelings are scary. It means not saying "pedophile" when you mean "child molester", because people don't choose who they're attracted to.<footnote((Also, as far as I've heard, most child molesters <em>aren't</em> pedophiles. They target children because children are easy targets, not because they have any particular attraction to them. And why are children easy targets? It's not just because they are physically smaller and weaker. It's because other adults already told them to be ashamed of sexual things, so they're less likely to report the assaults. And it's because other adults might not believe the children if they do report. This is especially true for neurovariant children. Child molesters often target neurovariant children because they know that neurotypical adults are less likely to believe or protect those children.))> It means not stigmatizing people for their anger or obsessiveness or lack of empathy. The only real thing to judge is whether they actually hurt people or not. It means not writing people off as "attention-seeking", because there's nothing wrong with trying to get some attention, especially if you're in distress.<footnote((People say this line a lot when female teenagers make suicide attempts. Usually, a person doesn't <em>do</em> that when ze doesn't have major problems in zir life. If you ignore zem or ridicule zem because ze's "just looking for attention", you might be part of the problem .))></p>

<p>Neurodiversity means understanding that some people may enjoy things that you find disgusting, and some people may be disgusted by things you enjoy. It means that both of those are okay as long as you don't try to push your preferences onto each other. It means not trying to insist that some consensual sexual behaviors are "normal" and others are "perverted". It means not ridiculing people from different cultural backgrounds, even if their traditions seem weird to you.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means knowing that no story can have a truly "universal" message. A love story will not include a reader who is aromantic. A story about the folly of arrogance will not include a reader who struggles with feelings of worthlessness. What about a story about a person who fights with zir parents, but later comes to accept them? It will not include the reader who rejected zir abusive parents and completely cut ties with them. And the story about a person who fights back against abusers will not include a reader who is too empathetic to be willing to hurt anyone. Neurodiversity means believing that all those readers exist, and that they all matter. If you're a writer, it means finding ways to write about the experiences of all kinds of people, not just the most common ones.</p>

<p>And most of all, <strong>neurodiversity means talking about how we perceive the world</strong>. I had one conversation about neurodiversity where it turned out that some of us had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow">visual snow</a> and others didn't. The people who did have it <em>hadn't known that most people didn't have it</em>. But imagine a world where these kinds of conversations were normal and everyday. Imagine all the <a href="/blog/imagining-pain">little secrets we would know about each other</a>. Imagine a world where children grow up knowing how to talk about brain differences. Imagine them coming to understand other people so much better. In our world, neurotypical people often fear and abuse neurovariant people, but imagine that they simply understood them instead. In our world, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520/">brain damage can sometimes make people behave violently</a>, but imagine that it was normal to help those people instead of isolating them until they get worse. Really, what problem in the world <em>isn't</em> caused by human brains, one way or another? And how can we solve any problem if we don't know how to talk about it?</p>

<p>And once you've imagined that world, go out and make it real.</p>

<p> &ndash; Eli</p>

<p>I had an idea that doesn't fit into any of the current stories I'm developing, and basically wants to be a novel in its own right, so I'm probably not going to be able to write it. So I'll write about it here instead. For fun, I'm going to describe it in the order I thought of it.</p>

<p>It started with the idea of <strong>destroying a person's mind</strong>. Zir body still functions, and ze can even still talk a little and give basic replies, but most of zir personality is gone, ze doesn't recognize people ze used to know, ze's completely cold and unfeeling, and ze barely bothers to fulfill zir basic needs. This kind of thing <em>can</em> happen in real life, but it's more common in fantasy settings, especially horror-fantasy; I was thinking about it because something similar happens in <a href="/blog/recommended-website-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality">HP:MoR</a>.</p>

<p>I've got a lot of respect for good horror stories. After all, what is writing if not an attempt to effectively convey an image or idea, and what is horror if not a <cut>very specific, very powerful image or idea? The destroying-someone's-mind thing fits right in; it's been done a lot of times, because it's effective. After all, the standard advice for horror fantasy is that the closer something is to reality, the more horrifying it is. Or, another way to look at it is that humans usually have a very strong fear of losing people they know, and they tend to be somewhat numb to actual death because there's lots of death in stories, so when you find a way to destroy a person that isn't actual killing, you get the full horror with much less resistance.</p>

<p>Back to the story. At this point, it was only a germ of an idea, and not a particularly strong one, because technically, doing that to a person is pretty much the same as killing them, and "somebody dies" isn't really the basis for a story. But I was fascinated by the idea. It's got an obvious question in it: What to do with the non-functional person? To me, the answer is easy: It's not a person anymore, just a shell. If it causes you inconvenience, go ahead and kill it.</p>

<p>But <strong>whenever something is easy, I try to make it hard</strong>. So I thought, what if a little bit of the original person is left? So little that you'd barely think they're the same person, so little that it'd practically be revolting to make the comparison, but just enough that if you knew who ze was, there can be moments where you almost think ze's back again. And then the moment passes and ze's the shell again. I can get a big variety of <strong>different reactions</strong> from the people who knew zem before the change: There can be one who wants to kill the shell because ze's an insult to the memory of the original person, there can be one who thinks ze can be brought back somehow (hah!<footnote((Of course, that kind of thing (people getting messed up in one way or another and then being fully cured) happens ALL THE TIME in conventional stories. I hate it! Not just because it's unrealistic (in real life, brain damage is brain damage and there's usually no way to recover the bits that are lost), but mainly because it kills the impact of the thing. After all, if it can be completely undone, it can't ultimately be a very significant event, and if it was supposed to sound significant, I feel kinda cheated.))>), there can be one who tries to be nice to the shell anyway, but gets nothing in return because the shell has no sense of gratitude or empathy anymore (and because even if ze did, ze'd be able to tell that the kindness was sort of condescending). Ze sometimes acts weak and vulnerable and oblivious and naive, sometimes cynical and jaded and violent, and nobody can tell what the pattern is (I'd know how ze worked, but the other characters wouldn't). This kind of thing is great fodder for a story, because it's got <em>lots</em> of natural conflict built into it.</p>

<p>But there's still something in the corner of my mind, something I feel like known the whole time but can't put my finger on, that makes the idea yucky and incomplete.</p>

<p>And then it hits me.</p>

<p>Like any good fantasy story, what we're really talking about here is <strong>real life</strong>. Sure, in real life, there isn't a villain with magical powers who destroys your mind, but what we're really talking about is a person who develops major psychological problems over the course of zir life, for reasons we don't understand. And the story I've just described is a strong story in technical terms, but it's also a pretty condescending story. It's the "Look at these poor people who have to LIVE with a DISABLED person, see what THEY have to DEAL WITH" story. The story that leaves out what the disabled person zemself has to live with (one, a disability, and two, non-disabled people who aren't nice). What my germ-of-an-idea is missing is <em>the perspective of the shell</em>.</p>

<p>And yeah, the shell's perspective is really messed up. Half the time, ze can barely even tell what's going on around zem. Sometimes ze's aware that something's wrong; when somebody insults zem, ze feels like ze's supposed to be angry about it, and wonders why ze doesn't feel anything. It's like being half-asleep in a dream, and only being vaguely aware that things aren't the way they would be if you were awake. Other times, ze feels like ze knows what ze has to do, and has a strong impluse to hurt another person, and does it without wondering why or even feeling angry. And then there are those eerie moments of lucidity where ze knows exactly what's going on, and can talk about it, but doesn't know how long ze can stay that way.</p>

<p>But there's just enough of zem there to still be a person. Ze knows how ze feels about things, even though ze usually can't express it (especially because, before the change, ze didn't <em>have</em> the same feelings and didn't need to figure out how to express them). Ze can carry on a conversation, although ze tends to lose interest quickly, because most people try to talk to zem about things ze doesn't care about anymore. Ze can feed zemself, and dress zemself, most of the time.</p>

<p>The story goes like this:</p>

<p>The main characters are two siblings of the same gender, if any (I'm imagining them female, but it could be anything). The first is calm and calculating; the second is emotional and aggressive. The first likes comfort, the second likes fun and excitement. The first has a strong sense of tactics, the second has a strong sense of justice. If I don't mind the clich&eacute;, they're identical twins. They complement each other perfectly, and they have a really strong, loving bond.</p>

<p>Then something happens (industrial accident? battle with an evil wizard?), and Twin 2 isn't the same anymore. The first thing Twin 1 notices is that Twin 2's facial expression is wrong. Twin 2 is usually either grinning or furious, or both, but now, ze's expressionless and quiet. Twin 1 asks what's wrong, and Twin 2 ignores zem. Twin 1 pesters Twin 2 for answers until ze turns and says, "Shut up. I don't like you.". And means it.</p>

<p>The rest of the story has two main conflicts.</p>

<p>The first, the more obvious one, is Twin 1's internal conflict. Twin 1 has to deal with the loss of zir sibling &ndash; probably the most important entity in the world, to zem &ndash; and worse yet, the presence of this... <em>thing</em> in zir sibling's body. But there's just enough of zir sibling left for zem to cling to the hope that it'll come back. So ze keeps going back to Twin 2, trying to talk to zem, trying to get zem back somehow. Twin 1 keeps telling zemself that Twin 2 is gone, and trying to convince zemself not to keep trying at it.</p>

<p><strong>But the real story is Twin 2's story.</strong> The story of someone whose brain doesn't work the way everyone else thinks it's supposed to. The story of someone who has to figure out what to make of zir life, when ze doesn't feel like ze fits into any of the stories everyone else is telling about zem. When Twin 1 tries to tell zem what zir life was like before, ze only feels alienated.<footnote((Twin 1 is taking a personal sense of loss, which is a valid feeling, and turning it into a coercive way of interacting with another human being. I really, <em>really</em> don't like the way Twin 1 behaves in this story, although I can understand where it comes from.))> Twin 2's memory is still there just enough that ze knows ze's supposed to be sticking with Twin 1, but the feeling of connection is basically gone, and the only reason they stay together is because neither knows where to go from there. Twin 1 clings to Twin 2 like ze's desperately holding on to the side of a sinking ship, while Twin 2 stays with Twin 1 like ze's hanging around a crime scene out of morbid fascination. Each of them needs to realize that it's not healthy, and cut off contact with the other.</p>

<p>And it's all made much, <em>much</em> more complicated by the fact that there's just enough of Twin 2's original personality remaining that you can't say ze's just a whole different person.</p>

<p>In a bunch of cool things like feminism, there's the concept of "agency". An <em>agent</em> is a person who does something, so <em>agency</em> is when a person, or character, plays an active role in deciding what happens in zir life, rather than being a hapless victim. One part of disability-conscious writing is to make sure your disabled characters have agency &ndash; make sure they're not just victims to be pitied or monsters to be avoided.</p>

<p>And so Twin 2 is ultimately the one who moves on first. Ze finally manages to find a group of people who accept zem for what ze is, and moves away from Twin 1 for good.</p>

<p>Blargh.</p>

<p>I'm ready to post the novella that I mentioned in my first post here. I did some last editing earlier today. But before I can post it, I have to make some changes to the website, because I don't want to just copy the text into a blog post. And I can't make those changes right away because I'm tired of doing computer programming (colloquially, "coding").</p>

<p>I don't know why it happened. It's not because I'd been doing a lot of it, because I can sometimes code for weeks on end without getting tired. And it's not because I was failing to make progress, because I <em>had</em> been making progress on my drawing program when the tiredness hit me a week and a half ago. I suppose I could make an analogy to <cut>the poet's so-called "muse" &ndash; a force of inspiration that seems to come and go at its own whim, without the poet/writer/coder/whatever being able to control it. On the other hand, I don't actually believe that there are things in this world that we can't understand.</p>

<p>Annoyingly enough, essentially <em>all</em> of my current projects require me to do some coding before they can proceed. So this is a bit of a lull in my activity. Which makes me think of the concept of "idea producers" vs. "idea consumers"<footnote((I got those terms from somewhere; I don't remember where. It might have been from Edward de Bono's writing.))> &ndash; for example, people who write popular songs vs. people who listen to them. Obviously, each individual person sometimes produces ideas and sometimes consumes ideas, but some produce more than others, and some consume more than others.</p>

<p>Anyway, I described that concept so that I could say this: I've been taking a break from idea production, and consumed some ideas instead, by spending a week playing the computer role-playing game "Planescape: Torment".</p>

<p>The way I see it, Planescape: Torment is more like a novel than like a video game. Computer role-playing games (CRPGs) usually have fairly simple plots, like "You're a bunch of heroes; go save the world from the Dark Lord!". They have a bunch of dialogue, so you need to be <em>able</em> to read, but the main point is to do battle with foul monsters. Planescape: Torment is the opposite: You need to be <em>able</em> to fight monsters, but the main point is to explore the intriguing dialogue and plot of the game. I'm not going to talk about it too much, because (1) it has enough social problems that it isn't up to my standards for "recommended websites", and (2) even if it didn't, it's not readily available (since it's a commercial, non-Free, Windows-only game). But it <em>did</em> make me think about a bunch of ideas, which is cool.</p>

<p>I suppose I could write something here about why I, as a writer, find it valuable to read other people's work, or about why exchanging stories is a good thing even when they sometimes teach problematic lessons, or about the value of cariacture and other "unrealistic" elements in writing, but I'm not sure my ideas about those things are organized enough right now. Oh well.</p>
