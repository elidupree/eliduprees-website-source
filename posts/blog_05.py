<p>This afternoon, a reader asked me about how I use the term "neurodiversity". So I noticed that I hadn't made an epic post about what neurodiversity means to me.</p>

<p>I guess it's time to do that!</p>

<h2>What neurodiversity is</h2>

<p>As a concept, neurodiversity is the notion that different people's brains work differently.</p>

<p>As a movement or ideology, neurodiversity is the notion that brain differences are a natural part of how humanity works, and that our society ought to act in a way that works well for everyone, not just people who happen to have "normal"-enough brains.<footnote((A historical note: The term "neurodiversity" originates from the autistic self-advocacy movement, and is still sometimes used to refer only (or mostly) to autism. "Neurodiversity" is obviously the right term for the more-broadly-focused principle that I'm describing in this post, so if you don't think it means that already, I hereby steal it.))> It's about finding healthy ways to handle the problems that sometimes come from brain differences, while making good use of the advantages that come from having a neurodiverse population.</p>

<h2>What neurodiversity implies</h2>

<p>Neurodiversity means asking your friends how they feel, rather than assuming that you can always tell from their facial expressions or body language. It means trusting a person's account of zir own experiences, rather than assuming ze is dishonest or deluded when ze says something that seems unnatural to you.<footnote((Especially because people who lie about themselves usually figure out how to tell lies that sound natural to most people.))></p>

<p>Neurodiversity means arranging events that appeal to introverts as well as extroverts. It means recognizing that huge, noisy gatherings appeal to some people, and small, quiet ones appeal to others. It means not rating "happiness" by measuring extroverted behaviors. It means not assigning prescriptive standards of what people are "supposed" to want.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not expecting everyone to be able to participate in every activity. It means that when you're teaching a class, or running a conference, it's okay to propose a "fun" activity or an "icebreaker" game, but if someone says ze doesn't want to play, you must immediately accept that and not push zem into playing, even if you think zir objection is silly. It means being ready to compromise and seek alternate solutions when dividing tasks among people, because some things that are easy for you can be hard for others. It means not saying that a person is lazy if ze is too depressed to work, or that a person is selfish if ze needs others to cover for zem because a certain task has traumatic associations for zem. It means accepting all of those things <em>regardless of whether you know the specific conditions affecting zem</em>, because ze is not obligated to give you an extensive rationale for refusing any task &ndash; especially since, in some cases, ze may not be able to explain it in a way you would understand.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means understanding that some things that are entirely harmless to you can interfere with other people's ability to function. It means accepting that flickering lights, or background noise, or <em>lack</em> of background noise, or smells you might think are nice, or the presence of non-human animals, can all be too overwhelming for some people. It means being willing to find spaces that accomodate other people's needs, even if you can't see those needs.</em>

<p>Neurodiversity means giving trigger warnings before discussing traumatic subjects, so that people struggling with PTSD or self-harm or suicidal thoughts can avoid such material when they need to. It <em>also</em> means having enough respect for survivors to allow them to <em>choose</em> when to engage, rather than avoiding difficult subjects entirely.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not making too many assumptions based on how people are on the outside. It means not assuming a person is stupid because ze has language difficulties, or that ze is "immature" because ze gets upset easily when someone interferes with zir routine. It also means not assuming that a person <em>doesn't</em> have a mental disability just because you don't notice anything unusual about zem.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means recognizing that brain differences are often good. It means not calling a person's difference a "disability" unless ze identifies it as a disability zemself. It means not trying to "cure" someone if they don't ask for it. It means valuing the perspectives of autistic people <em>and</em> non-autistic people, extroverts <em>and</em> introverts, trans people <em>and</em> cis people, people with strong empathy <em>and</em> people with no empathy, sexuals <em>and</em> asexuals, multiples <em>and</em> singlets, people with spiritual instincts <em>and</em> those without.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not judging people for their feelings, even if those feelings are distasteful to you. It means not saying "pedophile" when you mean "child molester", because people don't choose who they're attracted to.<footnote((Also, as far as I've heard, most child molesters aren't pedophiles; they target children because children are easy targets, not because they have any particular attraction to them. And children are easy targets because the rest of society has already done most of the work of shaming them into not talking about how they were attacked, and making sure other adults won't believe them if they do talk about it.))> It means not stigmatizing people just for having no sense of empathy, because people don't choose whether they feel empathy. It means not writing people off as "attention-seeking", because when a person is looking for attention, there's usually a good reason for it.<footnote((People say this line a lot whenever a female teenager makes an ineffective suicide attempt. Usually, a person doesn't <em>do</em> that when ze doesn't have major problems in zir life, and if you ignore zem or ridicule zem because ze's "just looking for attention", then you're probably contributing to the problems that ze was trying to handle in the first place.))></p>

<p>Neurodiversity means understanding that some people may enjoy things that you find disgusting, and some people may be disgusted by things you enjoy; it means that both of those are okay as long as you don't try to push your opinions onto each other. It means not trying to insist that some consensual sexual behaviors are "normal" and others are "perverted". It means not ridiculing people from different cultural backgrounds, even if they observe traditions that seem weird to you.</p>

<p>Neurodiversity means not thinking that a story can have a "universal" message, because there is no universal human experience. A love story will not include your reader if ze is aromantic. A story about the folly of arrogance will not include your reader if ze habitually underrates zir own abilities. A story about a person who doesn't always see eye-to-eye with zir parents, but eventually comes to accept them, will not include your reader if ze has had to completely cut ties with zir own abusive parents. A story about a person who fights back against abusers will not include your reader if ze is a strong empath who can't hurt another human. Neurodiversity means believing that all those readers exist, and that they all matter. If you're a writer, it means finding ways to write about the experiences of people who are often ignored in mainstream literature.</p>

<p>And most of all, <strong>neurodiversity means talking about how we perceive the world</strong>. I was once having a conversation about neurodiversity on another website, and it turned out that some of the people in the conversation had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow">visual snow</a> and others didn't. <em>And the people who had it hadn't known that most people didn't have it</em>, because people usually don't talk about even basic things like how stuff looks when you look at it. Or when they do, they get into ridiculous arguments about how things "really" look, instead of honestly comparing their perceptions. And when I read things like <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520/">this article about people with brain damage that eventually made them commit violent crimes</a>, I can't help but think that if we lived in a culture where people would talk about what they feel, and where there would be support systems for people who need psychological help, then a lot of horrors could be avoided. Talking about things is the only way we can even <em>begin</em> to solve the problems they cause; most of the problems in the world are caused, directly or indirectly, by human brains, so <em>we should definitely be talking about what those brains are doing.</em></p>

<p>Does that sound like a good idea to you? Because it definitely sounds like a good idea to me.</p>

<li>Asexuality: <a href="http://www.asexuality.org/">The Asexual Visibility and Education Network</a> - a website with a lot of information/resources (though I don't recommend the forum; I was a member once, but I left because a lot of the members are bad at every social issue <em>except</em> sexuality differences)</li>
<li>Empathy: Sadly, I don't know of any non-empath self-advocacy sites that are healthy enough for me to be willing to publicly recommend them. For that matter, I'm the only person I know of who describes zemself as a "non-empath". Empathy differences are probably the least-explored issue out of any of these, and a lot of people are still happy to say that "not having emotional empathy" is the same as "being completely evil", which is kinda... not true, and also a pretty horrible thing to say.</li>
<li>Introversion: I don't know of any good introvert self-advocacy sites, but I bet they exist. Do you know of any? I'll try to find one I like and edit it into this post.</li>

<p>I had an idea that doesn't fit into any of the current stories I'm developing, and basically wants to be a novel in its own right, so I'm probably not going to be able to write it. So I'll write about it here instead. For fun, I'm going to describe it in the order I thought of it.</p>

<p>It started with the idea of <strong>destroying a person's mind</strong>. Zir body still functions, and ze can even still talk a little and give basic replies, but most of zir personality is gone, ze doesn't recognize people ze used to know, ze's completely cold and unfeeling, and ze barely bothers to fulfill zir basic needs. This kind of thing <em>can</em> happen in real life, but it's more common in fantasy settings, especially horror-fantasy; I was thinking about it because something similar happens in <a href="/blog/recommended-website-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality">HP:MoR</a>.</p>

<p>I've got a lot of respect for good horror stories. After all, what is writing if not an attempt to effectively convey an image or idea, and what is horror if not a very specific, very powerful image or idea? The destroying-someone's-mind thing fits right in; it's been done a lot of times, because it's effective. After all, the standard advice for horror fantasy is that the closer something is to reality, the more horrifying it is. Or, another way to look at it is that humans usually have a very strong fear of losing people they know, and they tend to be somewhat numb to actual death because there's lots of death in stories, so when you find a way to destroy a person that isn't actual killing, you get the full horror with much less resistance.</p>

<p>Back to the story. At this point, it was only a germ of an idea, and not a particularly strong one, because technically, doing that to a person is pretty much the same as killing them, and "somebody dies" isn't really the basis for a story. But I was fascinated by the idea. It's got an obvious question in it: What to do with the non-functional person? To me, the answer is easy: It's not a person anymore, just a shell. If it causes you inconvenience, go ahead and kill it.</p>

<p>But <strong>whenever something is easy, I try to make it hard</strong>. So I thought, what if a little bit of the original person is left? So little that you'd barely think they're the same person, so little that it'd practically be revolting to make the comparison, but just enough that if you knew who ze was, there can be moments where you almost think ze's back again. And then the moment passes and ze's the shell again. I can get a big variety of <strong>different reactions</strong> from the people who knew zem before the change: There can be one who wants to kill the shell because ze's an insult to the memory of the original person, there can be one who thinks ze can be brought back somehow (hah!<footnote((Of course, that kind of thing (people getting messed up in one way or another and then being fully cured) happens ALL THE TIME in conventional stories. I hate it! Not just because it's unrealistic (in real life, brain damage is brain damage and there's usually no way to recover the bits that are lost), but mainly because it kills the impact of the thing. After all, if it can be completely undone, it can't ultimately be a very significant event, and if it was supposed to sound significant, I feel kinda cheated.))>), there can be one who tries to be nice to the shell anyway, but gets nothing in return because the shell has no sense of gratitude or empathy anymore (and because even if ze did, ze'd be able to tell that the kindness was sort of condescending). Ze sometimes acts weak and vulnerable and oblivious and naive, sometimes cynical and jaded and violent, and nobody can tell what the pattern is (I'd know how ze worked, but the other characters wouldn't). This kind of thing is great fodder for a story, because it's got <em>lots</em> of natural conflict built into it.</p>

<p>But there's still something in the corner of my mind, something I feel like known the whole time but can't put my finger on, that makes the idea yucky and incomplete.</p>

<p>And then it hits me.</p>

<p>Like any good fantasy story, what we're really talking about here is <strong>real life</strong>. Sure, in real life, there isn't a villain with magical powers who destroys your mind, but what we're really talking about is a person who develops major psychological problems over the course of zir life, for reasons we don't understand. And the story I've just described is a strong story in technical terms, but it's also a pretty condescending story. It's the "Look at these poor people who have to LIVE with a DISABLED person, see what THEY have to DEAL WITH" story. The story that leaves out what the disabled person zemself has to live with (one, a disability, and two, non-disabled people who aren't nice). What my germ-of-an-idea is missing is <em>the perspective of the shell</em>.</p>

<p>And yeah, the shell's perspective is really messed up. Half the time, ze can barely even tell what's going on around zem. Sometimes ze's aware that something's wrong; when somebody insults zem, ze feels like ze's supposed to be angry about it, and wonders why ze doesn't feel anything. It's like being half-asleep in a dream, and only being vaguely aware that things aren't the way they would be if you were awake. Other times, ze feels like ze knows what ze has to do, and has a strong impluse to hurt another person, and does it without wondering why or even feeling angry. And then there are those eerie moments of lucidity where ze knows exactly what's going on, and can talk about it, but doesn't know how long ze can stay that way.</p>

<p>But there's just enough of zem there to still be a person. Ze knows how ze feels about things, even though ze usually can't express it (especially because, before the change, ze didn't <em>have</em> the same feelings and didn't need to figure out how to express them). Ze can carry on a conversation, although ze tends to lose interest quickly, because most people try to talk to zem about things ze doesn't care about anymore. Ze can feed zemself, and dress zemself, most of the time.</p>

<p>The story goes like this:</p>

<p>The main characters are two siblings of the same gender, if any (I'm imagining them female, but it could be anything). The first is calm and calculating; the second is emotional and aggressive. The first likes comfort, the second likes fun and excitement. The first has a strong sense of tactics, the second has a strong sense of justice. If I don't mind the clich&eacute;, they're identical twins. They complement each other perfectly, and they have a really strong, loving bond.</p>

<p>Then something happens (industrial accident? battle with an evil wizard?), and Twin 2 isn't the same anymore. The first thing Twin 1 notices is that Twin 2's facial expression is wrong. Twin 2 is usually either grinning or furious, or both, but now, ze's expressionless and quiet. Twin 1 asks what's wrong, and Twin 2 ignores zem. Twin 1 pesters Twin 2 for answers until ze turns and says, "Shut up. I don't like you.". And means it.</p>

<p>The rest of the story has two main conflicts.</p>

<p>The first, the more obvious one, is Twin 1's internal conflict. Twin 1 has to deal with the loss of zir sibling &ndash; probably the most important entity in the world, to zem &ndash; and worse yet, the presence of this... <em>thing</em> in zir sibling's body. But there's just enough of zir sibling left for zem to cling to the hope that it'll come back. So ze keeps going back to Twin 2, trying to talk to zem, trying to get zem back somehow. Twin 1 keeps telling zemself that Twin 2 is gone, and trying to convince zemself not to keep trying at it.</p>

<p><strong>But the real story is Twin 2's story.</strong> The story of someone whose brain doesn't work the way everyone else thinks it's supposed to. The story of someone who has to figure out what to make of zir life, when ze doesn't feel like ze fits into any of the stories everyone else is telling about zem. When Twin 1 tries to tell zem what zir life was like before, ze only feels alienated.<footnote((Twin 1 is taking a personal sense of loss, which is a valid feeling, and turning it into a coercive way of interacting with another human being. I really, <em>really</em> don't like the way Twin 1 behaves in this story, although I can understand where it comes from.))> Twin 2's memory is still there just enough that ze knows ze's supposed to be sticking with Twin 1, but the feeling of connection is basically gone, and the only reason they stay together is because neither knows where to go from there. Twin 1 clings to Twin 2 like ze's desperately holding on to the side of a sinking ship, while Twin 2 stays with Twin 1 like ze's hanging around a crime scene out of morbid fascination. Each of them needs to realize that it's not healthy, and cut off contact with the other.</p>

<p>And it's all made much, <em>much</em> more complicated by the fact that there's just enough of Twin 2's original personality remaining that you can't say ze's just a whole different person.</p>

<p>In a bunch of cool things like feminism, there's the concept of "agency". An <em>agent</em> is a person who does something, so <em>agency</em> is when a person, or character, plays an active role in deciding what happens in zir life, rather than being a hapless victim. One part of disability-conscious writing is to make sure your disabled characters have agency &ndash; make sure they're not just victims to be pitied or monsters to be avoided.</p>

<p>And so Twin 2 is ultimately the one who moves on first. Ze finally manages to find a group of people who accept zem for what ze is, and moves away from Twin 1 for good.</p>

<p>Blargh.</p>

<p>I'm ready to post the novella that I mentioned in my first post here. I did some last editing earlier today. But before I can post it, I have to make some changes to the website, because I don't want to just copy the text into a blog post. And I can't make those changes right away because I'm tired of doing computer programming (colloquially, "coding").</p>

<p>I don't know why it happened. It's not because I'd been doing a lot of it, because I can sometimes code for weeks on end without getting tired. And it's not because I was failing to make progress, because I <em>had</em> been making progress on my drawing program when the tiredness hit me a week and a half ago. I suppose I could make an analogy to the poet's so-called "muse" &ndash; a force of inspiration that seems to come and go at its own whim, without the poet/writer/coder/whatever being able to control it. On the other hand, I don't actually believe that there are things in this world that we can't understand.</p>

<p>Annoyingly enough, essentially <em>all</em> of my current projects require me to do some coding before they can proceed. So this is a bit of a lull in my activity. Which makes me think of the concept of "idea producers" vs. "idea consumers"<footnote((I got those terms from somewhere; I don't remember where. It might have been from Edward de Bono's writing.))> &ndash; for example, people who write popular songs vs. people who listen to them. Obviously, each individual person sometimes produces ideas and sometimes consumes ideas, but some produce more than others, and some consume more than others.</p>

<p>Anyway, I described that concept so that I could say this: I've been taking a break from idea production, and consumed some ideas instead, by spending a week playing the computer role-playing game "Planescape: Torment".</p>

<p>The way I see it, Planescape: Torment is more like a novel than like a video game. Computer role-playing games (CRPGs) usually have fairly simple plots, like "You're a bunch of heroes; go save the world from the Dark Lord!". They have a bunch of dialogue, so you need to be <em>able</em> to read, but the main point is to do battle with foul monsters. Planescape: Torment is the opposite: You need to be <em>able</em> to fight monsters, but the main point is to explore the intriguing dialogue and plot of the game. I'm not going to talk about it too much, because (1) it has enough social problems that it isn't up to my standards for "recommended websites", and (2) even if it didn't, it's not readily available (since it's a commercial, non-Free, Windows-only game). But it <em>did</em> make me think about a bunch of ideas, which is cool.</p>

<p>I suppose I could write something here about why I, as a writer, find it valuable to read other people's work, or about why exchanging stories is a good thing even when they sometimes teach problematic lessons, or about the value of cariacture and other "unrealistic" elements in writing, but I'm not sure my ideas about those things are organized enough right now. Oh well.</p>
