<p>(I've posted this elsewhere before, but I'm reposting it here because most of my blog audience probably hasn't seen it.)</p>

<p>(Content warning: discussion of abusive relationships.)</p>

A certain individual gains The Power Of Love. Unfortunately, the only thing ze loves is to cause misery, so ze becomes a supervillain. Ze makes people love each other so intensely that it throws their lives into ruin. Ze makes victims love their abusers, and ze makes stalkers love people who fear them. And if any of society's heroes or leaders use their power for good, ze makes them fall in love with someone who will exploit their powers for evil.

To oppose this villain, a new hero arises, who has The Power Of Friendship. Ze can project a magical force field called The Friend Zone. People in the Friend Zone automatically stop, think, and work out their problems with each other as if they are close friends. Our hero tracks down all the people who were influenced by the supervillain, and uses zir power to help them solve the problems the villain created. Despite their intense feelings, the power of friendship lets them pull through and make arrangements that are tolerable for everyone.

Anyway, ze's so successful at helping people that ze ends up with a crowd of admirers following zem everywhere, hoping ze'll friend zone them.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

I didn't <em>just</em> write this to make a joke out of the "friend zone" concept. (Don't worry if you don't know what that is &ndash; you're probably better off that way.)

On a more serious note, I think there's a problem with the idea of "true love". The feeling of love, like any other feeling &ndash; excitement, anger, pride &ndash; can either cause good things to happen, or it can cause bad things to happen, or both. So what is "true love"? Many people think that love only counts as "true love" if it's the good kind. So what should we call the bad kind or the mixed kind?

This isn't just a semantic dispute. Because love can hurt people, people NEED to have a way to talk about the kinds of love that can cause harm. Otherwise, how can they think about it without fighting with themselves? (<q>But it seems so much like love! But it's hurting me! But it seems like love, and love is good, right?! But...</q>) This applies to both the all-bad case (<q>he's only beating you because he loves you!</q>) and the mixed case, like where people have a loving relationship that is mostly good, but sometimes their love manifests itself as possessiveness that ends up hurting the other person.

If you're talking to someone, and they call this kind of thing "love", don't say "this is not love". Say the thing that matters: "this love is not good".

"blurb": "I'm not writing this post to convince anybody, but many people have found my beliefs about gods interesting.",
"contents":'''
I'm not writing this post to convince anybody, but many people have found my beliefs about gods <em>interesting</em>, so I figured I'd describe them here.

If someone asks, "are you an atheist?", I can comfortably say "yes", because I don't specifically believe in any gods. But if they ask "are you an atheist or an agnostic?", it gets more complicated. That's because the idea of a "god" can actually mean several <em>different</em> ideas, and I have different beliefs about each of them.

People often lump these ideas together, but they are quite distinct:

<h2>The Big Guy</h2>

This god goes around smiting people, performing miracles, making commandments, and so on. It's basically an immortal human with magic powers.

Most old religious books describe gods like the Big Guy. However, most religious people I've met don't really believe in a Big Guy &ndash; they believe in a different version of God. For instance, modern Christianity isn't really <cut>based on the descriptions in the Old Testament. Honestly, it shows up more as a talking point in bad atheist arguments (<q>Look! The idea of the Big Guy is silly! Therefore, ALL religious beliefs are silly!</q>).

I believe that <strong>we have sufficient evidence to conclude that no gods of this type exist</strong>. If they did exist, they would leave lots of evidence. Since we haven't seen that, we can conclude that they don't. This makes me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_atheist">strong atheist</a> about this type of god. It's not <em>inherently</em> impossible for the Big Guy to exist, though. If somebody climbed out of the ground tomorrow and started striking things with lightning and turning shrubs into goats, I'd say, "yup, you could call that a god". I wouldn't necessarily <em>respect</em> it, though. Most of the gods from old religious books are tyrants and mass murderers.

<h2>The Designer</h2>

This god designed the world we know about. You could think of it as "the programmer of the cosmos". It designed the physics, then just left the world running for billions of years. Has it changed the world at all since then? Was it trying to create humans, or were they just an accident? Nobody knows.

It's impossible to find evidence against this god. No matter what you observe, the god could have just designed the world so that you would observe that. I suppose that makes me an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic">agnostic</a> about this type of god. But my real beliefs are more like "This could technically exist, but I know it doesn't." That's probably how most people feel about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot">Russell's teapot</a>.

There <em>is</em> a difference between the teapot and the god. If the teapot exists, that doesn't explain anything. But if the Designer exists, that could explain the world we know about. But I don't want an explanation of <em>just</em> the world I know about. I'll eventually learn about something else (perhaps the Designer itself), and then I'll want an explanation of that too. Therefore, what I really want is an explanation of everything that exists. The-world-we-know-about can have a designer outside of the-world-we-know-about. But everything-that-exists <em>can't</em> have a designer outside of everything-that-exists, because if you're outside of everything-that-exists, that means you don't exist.

<h2>The Transcendent</h2>

This god is all around us. Do you feel it? It is love. It is the hum of the universe.

Specifically, this god <em>isn't</em> just an individual, intelligent person with great powers, like the Big Guy and the Designer are. So what <em>is</em> it, and does it exist?

To answer that, I'll ask a similar question: <strong>does the <em>sky</em> exist?</strong>

When we look upwards, we can say "there's the sky". The birds are in the sky. The clouds are in the sky. So when we say "the sky", do we mean "the atmosphere"? No, because we also say "the sun is in the sky" and "the stars are in the sky". Some of them are light-years away. Some of them have already exploded. If some of them are behind a hill, they are not "in the sky", even if they would be "in the sky" if you moved over by a few meters or waited an hour. It's clear that when we say "the sky", we're not talking about a specific thing that exists.

But <strong>here's the important part:</strong> if someone says, "the sky is beautiful this evening", not even the most picky atheist will say "you fool, don't you know the sky doesn't exist?". That's because the atheist understood what the person meant. Even though the person <em>said</em> "the sky", as if they were trying to refer to a thing that exists, what they <em>meant</em> was about their human experience of the sky, which <em>does</em> exist.

The Transcendent is similar. People have a lot of feelings, and they want to express them. Sometimes, "God" or "Divine" is the best word the people find to express them. That's not wrong.

Sometimes, when people talk to me about the Transcendent, they act as if <em>everyone</em> must have these feelings. This frustrates me, because I don't have those feelings myself. It's obvious to me that at least one of their beliefs is incorrect. But they don't necessarily have incorrect beliefs about <strong>gods</strong>. They might just have <a href="/blog/neurodiversity">incorrect beliefs about <strong>brains</strong></a>.

I'm not sure there's a term like "atheist" or "agnostic" for my perspective here. It has some things in common with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_noncognitivism">theological noncognitivism</a> &ndash; I think that descriptions of the Transcendent do not describe anything that <em>can</em> exist in a literal sense. But the difference is that my response is not, "ha ha, people who describe the Transcendent are thinking wrong!", but instead, "if they're not describing a literal existence, let me figure out what they <em>are</em> trying to express."

"title": "Imagine a ball, but not what color it is.",
"tags": ["neurodiversity"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "The first post in a series about my internal language.",
"contents":'''

<p>(I've been thinking about writing a blog post about my internal language. However, that might be a bit too complex for just <em>one</em> post. So this post might be the first in a series.)</p>

Can you imagine a ball, without imagining a ball of the specific color?

Can you imagine a handheld tool, like a hammer or a screwdriver, without imagining which one it is?

Can you imagine a person, without imagining someone of a specific gender or race?

For me, these things are not just <em>possible</em>, they are <em>automatic</em>. If you tell me "imagine a ball", I imagine the <em>idea</em> of ball-ness. Nothing else is specified. If you ask me, "what color is the ball you imagined?", that question doesn't make any sense. It's like if you asked me "what color is a crayon?". There are lots of different colors of crayons. I can't answer unless you ask something more specific.

For a lot of people, if you asked them to think of a ball, they would automatically think of a <em>specific</em> ball. They would have to do extra work to imagine the idea of a ball without imagining a specific ball. Or they might not even be able to do that. For me, it's the other way around &ndash; I actually have to do extra work to imagine a <em>specific</em> ball, but imagining a generic ball is trivial.

That's not my only trick, either. Watch this: I'm imagining one of the metal forks from my kitchen. And now I'm imagining that the fork still has <em>some number of pointy tines</em>, but not what specific <em>number</em> of tines it has. But here comes the good part: I'm separating the points from the tines. Now, on the right side of my mind, I have a metal fork with some number of tines, which don't end in any specific way. And on the left side of my mind, I have a row of points, which aren't made of a specific material, and aren't attached to anything.

What?

There's a couple of different things I need to explain <cut>here. Let's go!

<h2>Translation</h2>

Suppose you're thinking of an object, and you have to explain it to somebody else. To do that, you have to describe that object in words. I think of this as <em>translation</em>: you have to <em>translate</em> from thoughts to words. And then when the other person hears it, they have to translate your words into their own type of thoughts. If you're lucky, not too much information is lost in translation. But there's always <em>some</em> loss.

If you look at a real object and then think about it, that works a similar way. You <em>translate</em> the real object into thoughts. It's also possible to translate thoughts into a real object, although it's harder, because you have to actually create the object.

In all of these cases, some things can hardly be translated at all.

<ul>
<li>Words to thoughts: Try to translate "the if of about six tell" into meaningful thoughts, I dare you.</li>
<li>Thoughts to words: If you have a feeling, and you don't already know a word for that feeling, you usually can't translate it into words.</li>
<li>Objects to thoughts: If you see something completely unlike anything you understand, your thoughts won't be very good at describing what the thing is like.</li>
<li>Thoughts to objects: Most thoughts don't represent objects. The idea of friendship, for instance.</li>
</ul>

When I see a fork, I can translate it into thoughts. If I could shape metal, I could translate it back into an object, with pretty good accuracy. But I could also rearrange the thoughts into something that translates differently.

The individual words in "the if of about six tell" can normally have meaning, but I rearranged them into something that didn't mean anything. Similarly, I could take my idea of a fork, and rearrange it into a complete mess of curves, pointiness and metal. That's a form of mental gibberish, just like the English gibberish that I wrote earlier. By rearranging the ideas into a meaningless form, I deliberately made it impossible to translate into other forms. I can't make a real object that fits the "gibberish fork" description. I can't even write an English explanation that would let other people imagine the same "gibberish fork" that I'm imagining.

Do people usually have thoughts that are possible to translate into words? Or are most of their thoughts untranslatable? I suspect it's the latter. Most of my own thoughts don't have any obvious translation into English. The unusual thing about me is not that I <em>have</em> so many untranslatable thoughts &ndash; the unusual thing is that I <em>understand</em> my untranslatable thoughts well enough to say that.

It's fun to make up gibberish, just to see what it feels like. But there's lots of other interesting things to do, too. When I took the points off the fork, I created a new idea that <em>does</em> have some form of meaning &ndash; just an unusual one. And that brings us to...

<h2>Instantiation</h2>

Suppose I asked you to translate the phrase "a chair" into an object. In order to make a chair, you have to make a specific <em>type</em> of chair. Later, I can show your chair to someone else and ask them to translate it into English. But there will <em>never</em> be a guarantee that they translate it as "a chair". If you made the chair out of wood, for instance, they might translate it as "a wooden chair". By making the chair, you were forced to <em>add new information</em> that wasn't in the original phrase.

I call this <strong>instantiation</strong>. "Chair" is a <strong>category</strong>. A specific chair is a <strong>instance</strong> of that category. When you start with a category and choose an instance, you've <strong>instantiated</strong> the category. When you start with an object and choose a category that describes it, you've <strong>categorized</strong> the object.

Generally, instantiation adds information and categorization removes information. That's not completely true, though. Think about how someone could also translate the wooden chair as "a piece of wooden furniture". When you created the chair, you <em>added</em> the information of what kind of chair it was, but you <em>removed</em> another piece of information: the fact that the chair-ness was the important part. And there are many different layers of categories: "chair" is more specific than "furniture" is more specific than "tool" is more specific than "object".

<strong>All translation involves a lot of categorization and instantiation.</strong> Imagine that you're trying to explain the idea of "furniture", but in a language doesn't have a word for "furniture". You could do it by categorizing: "Big household objects that are used for holding your body or your possessions." Or you could do it by instantiating: "Things like chairs, tables, and beds." Usually, the best way is a combination of the two.

Compared with normal English, my own thoughts are much closer to the "category" end of the scale. When I translate from English to my own thoughts, I use a lot of categorization and only a little instantiation. So when I have to translate from my own thoughts back to English, I mostly have to instantiate them. It's <em>possible</em> to write in English at my normal level of categorization, but not generally a good idea. Imagine if I had written this post like this:

<blockquote>
Can you imagine an object of some specific type, without imagining the object having any attributes other than being an object of that type?

For me, that's not just <em>possible</em>, it's <em>automatic</em>. If you tell me to imagine an object, I imagine the <em>idea</em> of that type of object. Nothing else is specified. If you ask me about a specific attribute of the object I imagined, that question doesn't make any sense.
</blockquote>

That looks worse even to me. English just isn't suitable for this kind of thing. In English, it's much better to explain things by example.

Back to the fork example: When I took the points off the fork, that was something like categorization. I started with a fully detailed fork, and separated out just the <em>idea</em> of a row of points. You could call this a "phrase" in my internal language. It translates pretty well to English: "row of points".

But now I can break it down more. I can separate the row of points into just the <em>idea</em> of pointiness, and the <em>idea</em> of a row of something. And those two ideas can't be broken down further. So you could say they are two  of the the <strong>words</strong> of my internal language.

In the next post in this series, I think I'll talk about what my words are made of, and how they can be put together.

"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "These are a couple of my mental techniques for problem-solving.",
"contents":'''
These are a couple of my mental techniques for problem-solving.

<h2>Tuning out</h2>

Sometimes, I work on the same problem for a long time, but I get stuck. I keep thinking of slightly different solutions, but none of them actually work. Focusing really hard on the specific problem isn't helping me. So I "tune out". I keep directing my brain to think about the problem, but I relax and don't focus so hard on specific solutions. Doing this often gives me useful new ideas.

I'm going to try to explain exactly what I'm doing and how it helps. But before I can do that, I have to explain some things about how brains work.

Let's say someone shows me a picture of a bear. I can immediately say, "that's a bear", without having to think about it. How did I do this?

<p><em>Somewhere</em> in my brain, there's the knowledge of what a bear is. But there's also a lot of other knowledge. Suppose my brain had a single CPU, and it had to go to all the knowledge one at a time. "Is it a twig? Nope. Is it a sack of potatoes? Nope. Is it the Burj Khalifa? Nope. Is it..." This process will eventually get to "Is it a bear?", but it will take forever. So that can't be how it works.</p>

Instead, I want you to imagine that my brain has separate processors for every single <cut>piece of knowledge. When I see the picture, all of the processors start analyzing the picture at the same time. The "twig" processor sees that it's not a twig and shuts up. The same thing happens with most of the others. But the "bear" processor sees that it <em>is</em> a bear, and starts yelling, "It's a bear! It's a bear!". Now, the rest of my brain also knows that it's a bear. And that includes the brain-part that allows me to speak the words "it's a bear" out loud.

Now let's say you ask me something else about the picture, like "How tall you think this bear is?". Now, I don't want to keep thinking about the fact that it's a bear. I want to think about the specific details instead. I need a way to get the "bear" processor to stop yelling "bear, bear, bear". So I make an announcement to <em>all</em> the processors: "Only send me information related the height and proportions."

This is a <strong>context change</strong>. This almost always happens automatically. Most people don't even think about the fact that they're doing it.

Your context can also be <strong>sharper</strong> or <strong>less sharp</strong>. Some people can focus very sharply on a specific subject, and suppress almost all other information. There are stories about researchers not even noticing what's going on around them, because they are working on a problem so hard. I'm not quite as extreme, but I do think I'm above average in how sharply I focus on things.

A sharp focus has an advantage &ndash; you won't be distracted by useless information. But it also has a disadvantage &ndash; some of the information you suppress might actually be useful.

That's where "tuning out" comes in. When I'm trying to solve the problem, I normally focus as sharply as I can. When I "tune out", what I'm really doing is <em>making my focus less sharp</em>. That way, I can receive more information that might be useful.

There are other things I can do, too. Because I've practiced this a lot, I have a lot of conscious control over exactly what context I'm using.

Sometimes, I alternate between tuning out (to get more information) and tuning back in (to analyze the new information in more detail).

Other times, I change the context in other ways. For instance, I might say to myself, "Okay everybody, I need to do this lots of times in a row, so give me any information about doing something like this quickly. Don't worry if it solves the problem exactly." (I don't actually say those <em>words</em> to myself &ndash; it's something I understand internally. This is just my best translation of it.) Once I get that information, I might be able to rearrange my original problem so that it can use the quicker solution. Or even if the quicker idea doesn't quite work, it might inspire me to think of something that does.

<h2>Dream thinking</h2>

There are a bunch of stories about scientists having brilliant ideas in their dreams. That hasn't happened for me, but I <em>do</em> often have good ideas while I'm going to sleep or waking up in the morning.

One time a couple years ago, I got out of bed, but didn't really feel completely awake. My thoughts were still sort of random and incoherent, the same way they are in my dreams. Instead of trying to wake myself up, I started thinking about a programming problem I had been working on the previous day. I actually came up with a lot of good ideas that way.

That got me thinking: Can I make myself have dreamlike thoughts on purpose? So I experimented with trying to make my thoughts less dreamlike and then more dreamlike. I actually got pretty good at it. I don't think I would have been able to figure this out if I had been fully awake in the first place. But now that I have figured it out, I can take my thoughts about halfway to the dreamlike state even when I'm fully awake.

"Dream thinking" is like a more extreme version of tuning out. When I use dream thoughts, I don't <em>just</em> turn off the context. I also turn off another thing: the part of my brain that tries to make everything makes sense. I just let my brain keep running with whatever ideas it comes up with, even if those ideas don't initially seem to make sense or relate to the problem. You could put it this way: "If you've already tried all of your ideas that make sense, and they didn't solve the problem, try some of the ones that don't make any sense."

Dream thinking is a lot harder to control than tuning out. The dream thoughts tend to run off and think about things completely unrelated to the problem. When I tune out, I still stay in the same context &ndash; just not as sharply. But dream thinking gets a lot less effective if I try to restrict the context <em>at all</em>. Instead of trying to <em>stop</em> those thoughts, I just keep running different parts of the problem through my head and letting the thoughts go wherever they want with them.

This tends to give me a lot of useless and/or <a href="/blog/imagine-a-ball-but-not-what-color-it-is">untranslatable</a> ideas. But it's great for finding ways to look at the problem from a new perspective. I come up with a lot of things that I would never have thought of if I just discarded everything that doesn't make sense at first.

"title": "How to Train Your Brain, Part 1",
"tags": ["neurodiversity"],
"auto_paragraphs": True,
"blurb": "Since other people haven't invented the best techniques yet, I was forced to invent a lot of techniques myself.",
"contents":'''

A lot of people assume that you can't train creativity or intelligence. I know that's not true, because I've done it myself. That is, I have improved my intelligence &ndash; including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_intelligence">fluid intelligence</a> &ndash; through deliberate training.

Here's the real reason people think you can't do it: We just haven't figured out the best <em>techniques</em> for training your brain yet. That's understandable, since brains are complicated and <a href="/blog/neurodiversity">different for different people</a>. Since other people haven't invented the best techniques yet, I was forced to invent a lot of techniques myself.

I'm very interested to see whether I can share my techniques with other people. A lot of them are internal and <a href="/blog/imagine-a-ball-but-not-what-color-it-is">untranslatable</a>, but I think a lot of them can be explained &ndash; and they might even be useful for other people. This post is my first attempt to do that.

<h2>The basics</h2>

I'm going to explain a few of the basic ideas that I always use when I train myself. This is <strong>general brain training</strong>. It's not specifically "intelligence training" or "anger management training" or "memory training", although I've used it for all of those things.

To help explain the ideas, I'm going to use a specific example from my life. When I was around 10 years old, <cut>I was a bit nervous about going into dark places. I thought that was a silly thing to be nervous about, so I changed it, using an older version of these techniques. I'm going to use this example because it is a relatively <em>simple</em> task: "I get nervous, and my goal is to stop getting nervous." Intelligence is much more complicated, so I'm going to leave that for a later post.

<h3>1. Observe your brain</h3>

"I get nervous when I go into dark places" is a good place to start, but there's lots more to learn. Am I nervous about the <em>idea</em> of going into the dark, or only the actual <em>experience</em> of having the darkness around me? If I <em>imagine</em> going into a dark place, does that trigger the nervousness too? What if I imagine different <em>kinds</em> of dark places &ndash; big open ones, small cramped ones, etc.? How about turning all the lights off in a room that I'm already standing in?

When you're doing this kind of thing, the goal is to imagine something that will <em>trigger the nervousness on purpose</em>. The more different ways you find to trigger it, the more you'll understand where it's coming from. You could think of yourself like a doctor, poking in different places to see where it hurts.

By exploring these questions, you can figure out exactly what part of your brain is causing the problem. In my case, it turned out that my brain was perceiving unknown dark spaces as a <em>possible threat</em>. I was nervous about going <em>close</em> to a large dark space, but I wasn't bothered by darkness if I already had a good sense of what was around me. For instance, a tiny dark closet wasn't a problem at all, because my brain didn't feel like there was enough room in the closet for anything spooky.

If you're trying to gain a new ability instead, look around your brain for anything that does something similar to what you want. Just like before, keep poking it in different ways to see what makes it do its thing.

<h3>2. Teach it the correct way</h3>

Once I knew what I wanted, I repeatedly imagined myself going into dark spaces <em>while remaining calm</em>.

Your conscious thoughts are only a tiny part of your whole brain. Your conscious thoughts are easy to change, but that's not the point &ndash; the point is to change the large mass <em>behind</em> the conscious thoughts. You could imagine your conscious thoughts as a broom, and the rest as a huge heap of sand. Dragging the broom a long way away won't move the sand, but if you move the broom in just the <em>right</em> way, you can slowly <em>sweep</em> the sand in the direction you want.

So how do you sweep your brain? Generally, when you imagine doing something, it uses a lot of the same neurons that you use when you <em>actually</em> do the thing. By imagining something, you can walk yourself through the process that you <em>want</em> to happen, rather than the process that happens normally. Think of it as waking up a specific part of your brain, then showing it what to do.

This is where your observations become really important. You have to wake up the exact part of your brain that you want to change. In my case, I had to imagine exactly the situations that would normally make me nervous. I could have easily imagined staying calm while going in a dark closet, but that wouldn't have been useful.

<h3>3. Never fight with yourself</h3>

If you're trying to imagine staying calm, and you find yourself feeling nervous anyway, <em>don't</em> keep trying to stay calm. Stop imagining and start over, and try doing it a different way next time. Your brain will remember exactly how you imagined it, whether it was right or wrong. You can never teach your brain that the <em>wrong</em> way is <em>wrong</em>. You can only teach it that the <em>right</em> way is <em>right</em>. 

Therefore, you have to keep thinking of new things to try until you find one that works <em>and</em> is right. Maybe you can make it work if you practice imagining similar things, then come back to the important one after you've gotten more automatic at imagining it the right way. Maybe instead of trying to replace nervousness with calm, you can focus on a stronger feeling, like pride or conviction.

A lot of people talk about "suppressing" their emotions, or keeping them "bottled up". This is completely different from my techniques. When you suppress an emotion, you're not changing that part of your brain at all &ndash; you're just trying to stop it from waking up. With my techniques, you deliberately wake up the problem parts, so that you can permanently reshape them to be less of a problem.

In Part 2, I think I'll talk about how I use these same techniques to make myself better at remembering new information.
