<p>(This post is basically just a list of things. I could have written about each of these things individually, but I'm having some health issues right now, and so I don't have the time-and-energy to write nicely about all of them.)</p>

<p>This weekend, I participated in the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin<footnote((Those are names of colleges. I attend Colby College.))> Festival of Live Performance and Digital Media! That was a weekend-long event where three groups of six students each developed a 5-10 minute theatrical/dance performance that incorporated cameras, projectors, sound effects, and such stuff, all controlled through computer input. It was pretty awesome, and I hope I'll be able to work with some of this equipment more in the future. The faculty in charge made video recordings of all three performances; if they have time, and can get permission from all the right people, then I might be able to show you them.</p>

<p>I recently found a really nice interview with a person who's studying addiction, brain development, and mental illness. It's <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/5/30/dr_gabor_mat_on_the_stress">the first interview on this page</a>, and it's 14 minutes long. A transcript is available. (I don't recommend the other two interviews in the video, but I couldn't find anywhere that the first interview was shown on its own.)</p>

<p>What happened with my seeking-another-course-to-take is this: The English department waived my English Composition requirement, so I don't have to take any version of that class. Then I didn't find another class to take, so I'm now taking three classes<footnote((Well, two classes and an independent study.))> instead of the usual four. That's actually kinda nice, because it gives me more time to do other things, like my comics.</p>

<p>I'm still planning to post my novella as soon as I can, but my current health issue is making me too distracted to work. (Don't worry, it's temporary, but it's awfully annoying while it's here.) Ditto for posting comics on my regular schedule &ndash; we'll see how things are going by Saturday.</p>

<p>This post is to give you some insight into how my creative process works!</p>

<p>So... Instinct vs. intellectual understanding. Complex ideas are great. The only trouble with complex ideas is that you can't keep the whole idea in your conscious mind at the same time. So you need to just rely on the knowledge you already have, so you can build on it. The things you're thinking about actively, I call "intellectual understanding"; the things you already know, that you can use without thinking, I call "instinct".</p>

<p>Of course, it's a good idea to go back and examine your instincts, from time to time.</p>

<p>I drew <a href="/a-couple-of-badass-superheroes/5">my last comic</a> mostly by instinct. Especially the panel borders. I didn't think "What do I want this line to express and how do I accomplish that?"; I just thought "Hmm, this line doesn't look right... *redraw* ehh... *redraw* ooh, this works!". In short, I had an instinct for what I wanted, but I didn't intellectually understand exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>I love understanding things, so after I drew the comic, I went back and analyzed my own work! Here are some of my thoughts:</p>

<ul><li>The flared border at the bottom of the second panel echoes the powers Tritia's using in that panel. It makes the concept clear that Tritia is having an effect on stuff, especially with the way it stabs into the larger image below.</li><li>The way the last panel is drawn "in front" of the others give it more emphasis (which is good, because part of the joke is the fact that such a mundane statement gets so much emphasis). It also puts it slightly outside the flow of the story, which is good, because the main flow is the fight with Tritia.</li><li>The way Jeva's katana ignores panel borders. It's a bit of a running joke to draw the katana above things that it would normally be drawn below, but it also works for me here &ndash; in the first panel, it helps capture the interrupted-ness of the continuation from the previous page, and in the last panel, it helps accentuate Jeva's droopy-ness. If it was in the panel, I'd have to move the speech bubble up, and anyway, having things break the normal rules usually helps emphasize them. Oh! And I hadn't even thought about the fact that putting the speech bubble at the bottom, curving down, added to the overall effect of that panel.</li><li>Some other things didn't work so well. For instance, there's no good reason for Sam's speech bubble to be all the way at the right side; it confuses the flow a little. That's something I can keep in mind when watching my habits of where I put speech bubbles. I also should have found a way to indicate more motion in the crevices (bits still falling off, perhaps?), to make it clear that Tritia just dug them. As it stands, you might think that they were there the whole time.</li></ul>

<p>Anyway, one of the interesting things here is this: I'm finding it just as productive to study my own work as to study someone else's. That makes sense right now, because I've read a lot of comics already, but haven't written very many of them myself... yet!</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, someone posted some evil, rape-excusing statements on one of my college's student/faculty/staff mailing lists. I won't talk about it much here, because I have a policy of not repeating evil things on this blog. However, it inspired me to draw this!</p>

<p>(That's a link to an image (I'm putting it behind a link because it's fairly large). Click the link to see it. A transcript of that image is below.)</p>

<transcript((ELI: Hello, folks!
Let's talk about affirmative consent,
and the myth of a "grey area" between
consensual sex and rape!
Consent is actually fairly straightforward,
but people don't always explain it perfectly.
Here, I'll explain it with an image!<br/>
<br/>
Panel: Two cheerful people.<br/>
PERSON 1: Want to have sex?<br/>
PERSON 2: Yeah! Let's do it!<br/>
This panel is labeled "CONSENT".<br/>
<br/>
Panel: A cheerful person and an idle person.<br/>
PERSON 1: Want to have sex?<br/>
PERSON 2: Yeah, whatever.<br/>
This panel is labeled "NOT CONSENT".<br/>
<br/>
ELI: This isn't very hard to understand.
If you ask someone fifty times,
and ze says no fifty times, and then you ask a fifty-first time and ze says yes, that is not consent. Compliance is not consent.
Compliance means that someone has decided that the trouble you'll cause for zem if ze doesn't comply is greater than the trouble of being sexed up when ze doesn't want it.
Which is exactly the opposite of the positive, mutually beneficial relationship you want with a sex partner.
Is there a grey area here?
Yes - it looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
Wide panel: At the left end is a cloud of grey smoke. At the right end is clear blue sky. The left end is labeled "GREY AREA"; the right end is labeled "CLEAR AREA".<br/>
PERSON IN THE GREY AREA: Oh, no!
With all this smoke around,
I have no idea if ze actually
wants to have sex
with me!<br/>
PERSON IN THE CLEAR AREA: Thank goodness!
My partner and I are
communicating well and
we both know exactly
what the other
wants!<br/>
<br/>
ELI: <strong>The grey area is the bad area.</strong>
The grey area is the one you want to
avoid at all costs.
The clear area is the
awesome area of super
sexy fun.
If you do sex to someone
while you're in the grey area, you might
not ever know whether you've committed rape.
That would be an incredibly stressful situation
to put yourself into.
You'd probably have a lot of cognitive dissonance
because you don't want to think of yourself that way.
And that would be very bad for you as well
as for your potential victim.
But the point here is not
"If you're in the grey area, don't have sex";
although that is important...
the point is,
<strong>"If you're in the grey area... get to the clear area."</strong><br/>
<br/>
Panel: Two people talking.<br/>
PERSON 1: I'm having a little trouble
figuring out what you're okay with - sometimes
I don't know if you're protesting or just playing
around...
So, um... Are you
interested in making out
for a while, and then
having sex?<br/>
PERSON 2: Oh, that would be
wonderful! Sorry, I've
just had a bad day and so
I'm a bit snippy. I could
really use some good sex
right now!<br/>
NARRATION: They then proceeded to have
the awesomest sex ever.<br/>
<br/>
ELI: Clear, honest communication
is the only weapon we have against
accidentally hurting each other over
and over for no good reason.
And it's also the sexiest thing
since vibrating dildos.
Use it.))>

I haven't added them to the actual website yet, but I'm going to do that momentarily.</p>

<p>Here are some of the new features:</p><ul><li>Comic pages now have a whole new, fancy display. (This was the main motivation for the upgrades &ndash; Next semester, I'm going to be writing a comic that I'm more serious about, and I need to prepare for that.)</li><li>Entire comment trees display at once. You won't have to waste time clicking through a long reply tree anymore. Also, they don't take up as much horizontal space.</li><li>There are a bunch of new "notify me when..." settings, to make things more convenient.</li><li>A bunch of internal improvements that'll make the pages load a little faster.</li></ul>

<p>There are still some more improvements that I wanted to make but didn't finish in time (today is the last day of a five-day break from college); I'll finish those in December, I guess.</p>

<p>This is something that I should have blogged about long ago!</p>

<p>The story starts on March 9, 2011. There was a campus forum on that day, on the topic of "Gender, Power, and Community" &ndash; lots of people were there, and we had a really good conversation about a lot of important issues, like sexual assault, silencing, and various forms of discrimination. I said, semi-jokingly, something like "We should have a 'Colby Sex Club' where people talk about the act of sex and what we want out of it! This seems like another silence that needs to be broken." I dropped the idea at the time, because I was busy with schoolwork, and because as a person who's never actually had sex with another person, I didn't feel like the most qualified to start it.</p>

<p>Then, this semester &ndash; October 19, to be precise &ndash; I went to an event that made me think of it again. Heather Pratt, an dedicated feminist leader who graduated from Colby last year, gave a talk about zir thesis, which was about sexual assault at Colby. Ze talked about a lot of specific cases, and they all seemed to have one thing in common &ndash; <em>nobody knew what the fuck they were doing</em>. People didn't know what consent was, didn't know what their options were, didn't know how to have enjoyable sex, and so forth. Both the victims and the perpetrators were trying to do what they thought was expected of them, not even thinking about what they actually wanted for themselves.</p>

<p>So then I got irritated by how terrible that is, and decided that I was going to start the Sex Club after all!</p>

<p>And then I did it.<footnote((Well, first, I spent a long time trying to plan to do it collectively with a couple of other people. They're wonderful people, but they had a lot of other stuff going on, and it didn't work out. So, eventually, I just set a time for the first meeting and stuck to it, even though I didn't have any co-leaders.))> Last Friday, December 2, we had our first meeting &ndash; not too many people were there, because it's near the end of the semester and people have tons of work to do, but we had a good conversation with the people there, and there's been a huge amount of energy on campus about the club. The conversation covered a bunch of different subjects, including how to ask for what you want and how to tell someone you're interested in them without being too awkward. (That's a problem at Colby and elsewhere &ndash; our culture is so filled with images of nonconsent that some people feel awkward if someone actually just asks "Is it okay with you if we [kiss / make out / have sex / whatever]?". Once you start asking, though, it's much nicer for everybody!)</p>

<p>We have a mission statement:</p>

<blockquote>The Colby Sex Club is a safe space for candid discussions about sex. We are inclusive of all genders, sexes, preferences, and so forth. We push the idea of enthusiastic consent, and encourage people to have healthier, better, more communicative sex. We stand against sexual assault, and will support survivors however we can.</blockquote>
