<p>"Man", "woman", "boy", and "girl" are <strong>scrutinized words</strong> on this website. You're allowed to use them, but if you do, they will be marked like this: man, woman, boy, girl, men, women, boys, girls.</p>

<p>I encourage you to use gender-neutral alternatives, like "adult", "child", or just "person", as I do. When I'm specifying someone's gender on purpose, I do it explicitly, as in "male person".</p>

<p> <i>Womyn</i> and <i>wymyn</i><footnote((<q>Womyn</q> is an alternate spelling of "woman". It was created by feminists in order to have a spelling that didn't contain "man", as if "men" are normal and "women" are a special kind of "men". I think this is generally a good step to take, but the word has become associated with a particular brand of feminism that is extremely hostile to trans female people. A key example is the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, an annual "women-only" event that has excluded trans female people and admitted trans male people. Since I am personally trying to avoid the word "woman" entirely, I do not have to decide how I want to spell it.))> are also included for completeness, because I've seen people use them on the Internet. I wanted to include "guy" in the list, but "guy" also means a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy">lot of other things.</a></p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Because they lump together a lot of different concepts, and lumping those concepts together is sometimes harmful to people.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to take a step back and explain that. The trouble is, it's not easy to do that. So I'm going to take another five steps back and explain things from scratch.</p>

<h3>Part one: Gender</h3>

<p>So, there's this thing called "gender". I wrote a little about it in <a href="/blog/scrutinized-words-she-he">my post about why I use the pronoun "ze" and scrutinize "she" and "he"</a>. Gender is really important, but nobody knows what it is, so I'm going to skip to something that's easier to describe.</p>

<p>So, there's this thing called "sex".<footnote((Actually, there are two things called sex. Here, we're talking about the one that's used to classify humans and other animals. <a href="/blog/sex">I'll talk about the other one in a different post.</a>))> In the case of humans... well, humans are diverse creatures. Some of them have vaginas, and some don't. Some have penises, and some don't. Some develop lots of facial hair when they reach puberty, some develop breasts, some have their voices deepen... and some don't. By a quirk of biology, most of these attributes are strongly correlated with each other, so we've grouped them all into two convenient little boxes. There's the box of deep voices, facial hair, and penises (and a bunch of other things), which we call the "male sex", and the box of breasts and vaginas (and a bunch of other things), which we call the "female sex". So if I have a human, and I ask a biologist what sex that human is, then the biologist will look at those attributes. If they all fit in the "male" box, the biologist will tell me that the human is male. If they all fit in the "female" box, the biologist will say female. If the human's attributes don't fit neatly into a box, the biologist will give up, go back to zir laboratory, and invent a fancy theory about why the human wasn't like ze expected. But the real reason that the human wasn't like ze expected is that we don't know everything about how humans work yet.<footnote((By the way, the currently accepted term for people whose physical attributes don't fit neatly into a box is "intersex", as in "that person is intersex". Although people don't generally use the term "intersex" to describe people who deliberately alter their bodies to change that.))></p>

<p>"Sex" is a biology term. Technically, it only refers to an individual's reproductive role. The other associated traits are called "secondary sex characteristics".</p>

<p>There's another thing called "assigned gender". When a person gets born, everybody around them usually goes and looks at their genitals and either says "It's a boy!" and starts giving them toy trucks, or says "It's a girl!" and starts giving them dolls and frilly dresses. When they do that, they're assigning the baby a gender. The baby usually doesn't get any choice in the matter. If its genitals don't look how the people expected, then they probably do weird medical tests to decide which gender they think makes more sense for it.<footnote((And they often also perform unnecessary surgery to make the baby more like they think it's supposed to be. What a bunch of assholes.))> Giving people different toys because of what gender you've assigned them is called <strong>sexism</strong>. Because our society is so sexist, people of different assigned genders often end up experiencing the world in significantly different ways.</p>

<p>When a trans-exclusionary feminist says something like "I'm talking about real women &ndash; women who were born and raised as women", ze is talking about <strong>assigned gender</strong>.</p>

<p>However, most of that time when people use words like "man", they're not talking about <em>either</em> of those things. People don't normally look at someone's genitals, or their birth certificate, before using those words for them.

There's another thing that I don't know a good name for. (Please tell me if you know a good name for it!) That's the gender that people usually decide you are when they see you. People are usually very stupid, so they look for easy cues to decide gender. Except that usually the cues they look for are physical sex cues, not gender cues; they look for breasts, facial hair, etc., so they're basically trying to decide your sex and they just assume that picking a gender for you based on that is okay. The main exception is that they also look for how long a person's hair is, which doesn't really make any sense because it's really easy to change how long your hair is, regardless of your gender or sex, if you have access to a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>When a person is in a room full of people they don't know and asks something like "who's that girl over there, wearing the fuzzy hat?", ze is talking about <strong>zir immediate gender identification of that person, whatever you want to call it</strong>. I'm going to use the phrases "male-perceived" and "female-perceived" to talk about this concept.</p>

<p>There's another thing called "gender roles". Remember that list of attributes associated with sex? Well, there are also lists of behaviors associated with gender. People usually expect you to do the behaviors associated with the gender they've picked out for you, and a lot of the time, they'll actively or passively discriminate against people who aren't doing them. The main difference between the gender lists and the sex lists is that the sex lists are biological fact, while the gender lists are arrant nonsense. I'm not even going to dirty this blog post by telling you what they are where I come from, because you probably hear about them all the time, and if you haven't heard about them, thank goodness for that!</p>

<p>When someone describes a female-perceived child who plays with male-perceived children at physical sports and games as "one of the boys", ze is talking about <strong>gender roles</strong>.</p>

<p>There's another thing called "gender identity". For one reason or another, some people think they actually <em>are</em> a specific gender, as opposed to just being assigned into it, or doing the activities associated with it, or subconsciously being of the sex associated with it. I haven't got a clue what that means, but it seems to be really important to some people, so I generally acknowledge that it is a thing that exists and is important. There are a lot of things that exist and are important even though I don't know how they work.</p>

<p>When someone refers to a male-identifying person as "she", and ze says something like "dude, I'm a guy", ze is talking about <b>gender identity</b>.</p>

<p>So, have I made my point yet?</p>

<h3>Part one and a half: No I bloody well haven't!</h3>

<p>The thing is, that whole essay about gender and sex and stuff isn't even the original reason I decided to scrutinize these words. I'm not saying it's not a wonderful reason to try to use more specific language, and to avoid overused, ambiguous terms like "woman" and "boy". But that's not the real reason that <em>I</em> have for avoiding those words, and I think it's a weaker reason.</p>

<p>After all, a person could say something like this:</p>

<blockquote>So what if people use those words to mean a lot of different things? Lots of people use lots of words incorrectly every day; that doesn't necessarily mean that you should avoid the words. It means you should use them correctly. And they're useful words, too: Think about how using the terms "trans man" and "trans woman" affirms trans people's identities, in a way that language like "FtM" and "MtF" don't. Your "unambiguous" language would say "trans female-identifying person" or "non-female-assigned female-identifying person", which, to my ear, sound like they're raising a note of skepticism about that identity, rather than affirming it.</blockquote>

<p>Well, okay, hypothetical person. I like what you're saying. But since you're advocating the continued use of the word "man", and you say you can use it in an unambigous way, I'd like to know what exactly you mean when you say "man".</p>

<blockquote>Simple: A person who identifies as male.</blockquote>

<p>So if I'm eight years old, and I say I'm male, then I'm a man?</p>

<blockquote>Oh. Sorry, I meant "An adult who identifies as male".</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Yes, you did. But what the heck is an adult, anyway?</p>

<h3>Part two: Age</h3>

<p>The same way I talked about in <a href="/blog/scrutinized-words-she-he">my post about <q>she</q> and <q>he</q></a>, there are two problems here. One has to do with how we categorize people, and the other has to do with the fact that we chose an overbearing binary categorization system in the first place.</p>

<h4>Passive exclusion</h4>

<p>Suppose I'm addressing an audience, on the topic of feminism, and I say "Women in this country face pervasive discrimination". There are two problems with that sentence. The first problem, of course, is that it's true. The second problem is that there are plenty of people who face the exact same kinds of discrimination I'm talking about, but whom I've left out. Discrimination doesn't magically start when you hit adulthood, so by saying "women", I passively excluded a lot of people.<footnote((You could argue that I'm not obligated to include everyone when I make a statement &ndash; after all, I have already excluded everyone who's not female, and hence left out a lot of people who face much worse gender-based discrimination than the average person who is universally perceived as female. However, if I'm talking about a kind of discrimination that is actually related to their female-perceived-ness, then that exclusion that is necessary to the basic idea of what I'm saying. Excluding people by age has very little to do with what I'm saying, so it is not justified, especially since it's an attack from a position of privilege &ndash; adulthood &ndash; against a group that lacks that privilege.))></p>

<em>I decided to scrutinize these words because I kept catching myself saying things like that.</em>

<p>On a related note, think about the hypothetical person I was talking to. Ze didn't even notice right away when ze said "people" and really meant "adults". That's an easy mistake to make if you've internalized the notion that non-adults aren't really people. Both this and the example from the last paragraph are instances of ageism. Ageism, as you've probably guessed, is active or passive discrimination against people of a marginalized age group. In general, all people who are not yet adults (whatever an adult is) are a marginalized age group. (Ageism also includes discrimination against people who are much older, because of their high age; that's not the subject of this post, but I'd be wrong to leave it out of the definition.)</p>

<h4>Active discrimination</h4>

<p>Okay, now <a href="/blog/scrutinized-words-she-he">go and re-read my post about <q>she</q> and <q>he</q></a>, except this time, replace "she" with "child", "he" with "adult", and "the minority of people who obviously don't fit in the gender binary" with "everyone who lives past the age of twelve". Go on, I'll wait.</p>

<p>When does a person become an adult? What the heck is an adult, anyway? It's just like the whole gender thing: Like gender, it's really, really important in society, and like gender, nobody has a clue what it really means.</p>

<p>As long as "man", "woman", "boy" and "girl" are our primary words for talking about people with genders (or sexes), we're going to have problems. It's not just a problem because it makes it awkward to decide what to say when you're talking about someone who's fourteen years old. It's also a problem because it creates a politics around the age categories. It makes every healthy conversation about gender into a secret nasty conversation about age, and every healthy conversation about age into a secret nasty conversation about gender. Even if you think it's okay to view specific events as coming-of-age events, we have language like "You're a woman now" and "separates the men from the boys" to make it so that you can't just be an adult... you have to be an adult in a gender-binary way! And that's not the only terrible thing it does. Let's look at another specific example:</p>

<p>So, there's this issue of people calling adult female people "girls", all the way up through their forties. Some people say it's bad because it reduces competent, independent adults to children.</p>

<p>Sure, that's bad... <em>if you were thinking of children as "lesser" in the first place.</em></p>

<p>Think about the schoolyard insult "You hit like a girl". It's pretty obvious how sexist that is. It's not sexist because you're telling a male-perceived child that ze's weak; it's sexist because the basic assumption of the statement is that female children suck at hitting because they're female. Of course, it's also an insult, and you shouldn't be insulting people anyway, so it's bascially a really bad idea on both counts. It's a statement that I'd be happy to blast from the language, and never look back.</p>

<p>Now think about the statement that calling an adult a "girl" is infantilizing. It's <em>true</em>, just like it's true that that "You hit like a girl" is an insult. People call adult female people "girls" because they think of female people as lesser and also think of children as lesser. But if you call out the sexism and not the ageism, you're just like the male child who yells back "I do NOT hit like a girl!" and leaves the basic, sexist assumption intact.</p>

<p>Like I said in the <q>she</q>/<q>he</q> post, that's only a symptom of the underlying disease, and the disease is the fact that our language pushes us to judge people based on their age before we make statements about their gender.</p>

<h2>My solution...?</h2>

<p>The easy way to communicate clearly is to say exactly what you mean (or as close as you can manage), and figure out which things you're thinking are true, and which are just convenient assumptions. Let's look at an example: Suppose we're debating abortion rights. Quick, tell me! What group is directly affected by access to abortions?</p>

<p>If you said "women", go find a buzzer so that you can make an annoying buzzing sound to mark your incorrect answer. The group affected is <i>people with functioning uteruses</i>. A lot of people with functioning uteruses aren't adults, and not all people with functioning uteruses are female-identifying. Of course, there's nothing stopping you from talking about how sexism affects legal abortion rights campaigns because of the strong correlation between functioning uteruses and female gender roles, <em>once you acknowledge that,</em> and by saying <i>people with functioning uteruses</i>, you have neatly avoided all the passively ageist and cissexist language. It's a lot of syllables, I know, but if worst comes to worst and you have to say it over and over again, you could always come up with a shorthand for it or something.</p>

<p>A few syllables is a small price to pay for a healthy society.</p>

  "contents":'''<p>I've been sleepy all day. Maybe I shouldn't have stayed up until 4:00 AM last night to write my last post? Heh heh.</p>

<p>Also, I should have mentioned this yesterday: I <em>did</em> go on to rewrite my little exercise in Haskell. The exercise takes an image, messes with it, saves it to a file, draws it on the screen thirty times over the course of fifteen seconds, and exits. You can look at my <a href="/TODO/files/sdl_exercise_1.cpp">C++ source code</a> and <a href="/TODO/files/sdl_exercise_1.hs">Haskell source code</a>. They're almost exactly the same. Both consist of a quick wrapper around the SDL_Surface manipulation and a list of SDL commands to execute. Neither does much error checking. The Haskell one has significantly fewer lines, but they're about the same in file size. When I ran them, I used my avatar image from this site as the image to mess with. It looked pretty cool.</p>

<p>I was a little surprised at how easily I could write the Haskell code, although maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised, since I've been studying it for a while (not to mention that I'm a very fast learner). Since I love Haskell so much, I'm probably going to stick to it.</p>

<p>Sometime when I'm not so tired, I'm going to write a programming-101 post about C++, Haskell, and why Haskell is so much more awesome. When I say "programming 101", I mean that I hope it will be accessible to people who don't do computer programming &ndash; but as with my posts about gender, I believe that introducing basic concepts before expanding on them is <em>also</em> the most effective way to communicate even with people who are already feminists / computer programmers. It makes what I'm saying be more grounded, more clear, and more precise.</p>

<p>Oh, and also &ndash; I have shipping information on my tablet now. The best estimate is that it will arrive June 21, which gives me an entire week to get used to Haskell programming. I think I'm going to try to port my 2D collision-detection library from C++ to Haskell. Or maybe write a cute Haskell/OpenGL game. Or both. Watch me.</p>

<p>Ahem. This will be a policy of my website. I intend to make my website appropriate for all ages of viewers, or at least, all ages that are likely to be able to use a web browser. Being appropriate for children implies a lot of different things, so I'm making this post to outline the most important ones.</p>

<p><strong>#1. Words like "fuck" and "shit"<footnote((By the way, if you're a child, and the people around you have been <em>rude</em> enough not to tell you what "fuck" and "shit" mean, you can find good descriptions on the Wikipedia pages for them &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck">fuck</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit">shit</a>.))> are totally acceptable here, because nothing's worse for children than censorship.</strong></p>

<p>This is hardly the most important rule, but it's a good one to set the tone of this post. Being child-friendly means treating children with respect; it means treating them as independent human beings. When an adult tells you not to say certain words, that adult is not respecting you. Ze is saying that zir own opinion is more important than yours. Even if the adult lets you say what you want, but avoids "bad" words around you (and by the way, there's nothing <em>bad</em> about swearing), the adult is doing that for zir own benefit, not yours. Ze is trying to influence what you say and think, because ze thinks you're more "innocent" that way. That's not helpful; it's patronizing, and condescending.</p>

<p>We live in a world where adults tell outright <em>lies</em> to children because they think it's <em>cute</em>.<footnote((The lie I'm thinking of is Santa Claus. A lot of adults tell children that there's a person, called Santa Claus, who lives at the North Pole and gives them presents for Christmas. It's as ridiculous as it sounds.))> I'm not going to participate in that.</p>

<p>I admit that choosing whether or not to swear isn't a very important issue. So let's move on to an issue that is very, very important:</p>

<p><strong>#2. I will talk openly about <a href="/blog/sex">sex and sexuality</a> here.</strong></p>

<p>This guideline (and the rest of them, really) is not just a child-friendliness issue; it's a human-friendliness issue. Most of the dominant cultures of the world are extremely sexually repressed; they don't talk about sex, they try to push sex-related information out of sight, and they even try to make people feel guilty for <em>thinking</em> about sex. Because of these things, when people actually <em>do</em> sexual stuff, they generally do it in a really bad way that's stressful for everyone involved. The only way you could make it worse would be by throwing everyone into teenage sexuality completely unprepared... which is exactly what we do by not talking to children about it.</p>

<p>A lot of people try to stop children from seeing anything that has anything to do with sexuality. They do this because they think it will "protect" children, but in fact, it does the exact opposite, by denying them access to information that is extremely important for them to have. It is also important for the information people can get about sexuality to emphasize consent, communication, and acceptance, rather than taboos and social power games.</p>

<p>I should also mention that children <em>do</em> often have sexual behaviors of their own, even before puberty. Adults often cause a lot of harm to children by trying to suppress this.</p>

<p><strong>#3. I will avoid saying things in a way that demeans, insults, or ignores people who are younger than I am.</strong></p>

<p>I wrote a lot about this in the second half of <a href="/blog/scrutinized-words-man-woman-boy-girl">this post</a>; I don't have too much more to say about it here.</p>

<p>A lot of parts of our society are designed in a way that pointlessly excludes children, because the adults who designed them were only thinking about adults. Whenever you use language that demeans children, like using "childish" as an criticism or saying that you deserve privacy or respect because you're an "adult", you're saying that children aren't <em>really</em> people, and they shouldn't really have the same rights other people do. This adds to the patterns of thought that make people ignore accessibility to children. I don't think it should happen; I believe that if something is intended for the public, it should be &ndash; as much as it can be &ndash; accessible to <em>all</em> the public, regardless of their age, physical disability, or any other attribute.</p>

<p><strong>#4. I will try to write in a way that is clear and easy to understand. I will avoid making unnecessary cultural references. I will not assume that my readers have much prior knowledge of most subjects.</strong></p>

<p>Whee! Finally one that isn't completely against what most adults think being "child-friendly" is about!</p>

<p>Technically speaking, this isn't purely a child-friendliness issue, because many children are highly knowledgeable can read complicated text, and many adults aren't. However, adults <em>usually</em> have more knowledge and can read more easily than children, so if I want to make sure my website is accessible to children, I need to consider that. This guideline is also here to help adults who aren't native English speakers and are only just learning; it's also to help adults who have mental disabilities that prevent them from reading complex text... and so on. If I assume that a person already knows something, and I'm wrong, then I have communicated badly. Since I'm on the Internet, where almost anyone can read what I write, I should avoid assuming <em>any</em> knowledge that I don't have to.</p>

<p>In some of my posts, like when I write about computer programming, I have to assume a lot of knowledge in order to be able to say anything about the subject. In those cases, I will try to put a note at the beginning of each post saying what knowledge it assumes.</p>

<p>I have a lot of things to say, and I think most people would benefit from reading my posts. It wouldn't be very nice for me to write them in a way that's inconvenient for some people.</p>
