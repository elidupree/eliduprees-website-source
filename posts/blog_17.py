This week's been a busy week. For one thing, I've all-but-completed Chapter 3 of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a>! I almost decided to rush it out to post today, but I figured I should get someone to proofread it first. But it's very likely I can have it ready by next week.

For another, I've kept working on my music stuff! I can't explain all of it, but I did make <a href="/media/interval_optimized_1_hour.ogg">some neat procedurally-generated music that I can show you</a>. I initially made a 30 second clip of it, but a friend asked me to generate a one-hour version because it sounded relaxing, so one hour it is! It's generated by an algorithm that picks random pitches, then tweaks them until they sound consonant according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(music)">odd limit</a> concept.

I also worked on drawing <a href="/comics">Voldemort's Children</a> a bit yesterday! I've had a lot of false starts in the past, so we'll have to see how it goes. This time, I think I've discovered that my idea of holding the stylus lightly was actually an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a>. Gripping it less hard gave me less control over it, which meant I ultimately used my muscles <em>more</em> to do the same amount of drawing.

My music generation has seen a lot of progress this week! <a href="https://soundcloud.com/elidupree">I made a Soundcloud page to show off some of the best things the system has generated.</a>

I've already gotten to work on Chapter 4 of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a>! It's around 1600 words now. Hopefully, I won't leave you all hanging for months like I did for the last chapter!

Finally, I've been making some slow progress on drawing <a href="/comics">Voldemort's Children</a>. It's not much, but I've managed to draw for 10 minutes on multiple days in a row without hurting myself, which is more than I've been able to for a long time. So maybe this is a sign of long-term improvement.

I've been very lethargic this week. I've tried to get myself to work on my projects, but I just haven't been able to. Both writing and programming are types of creative work that I can't do right now.

However! Drawing <a href="/comics">Voldemort's Children</a> is different, because I already wrote all the dialogue and sketched all the remaining pages. All I have to do is draw, not think about what to draw. And my hands have continued getting better. I've been regularly doing <em>two</em> 10-minute drawing sessions each day, and I'm on track to increase that. I've completed the line-drawing stage of about 3 pages in 2 weeks. There's a bunch more work after the line drawing, but if I'm lucky, I might even be able to start fully completing a page per week soon!

I'm still lethargic. I haven't been getting much done. This is unfortunate.

For most of my adult life, I've had a cycle: I'm energetic for weeks in a row, super productive, and feel like "Why would I ever not work on big projects? They are so fun!". Then I get lethargic for weeks in a row and don't feel like doing much at all. I recently talked to my doctor about this, and we think it might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothymia">cyclothymia</a>.

It's taken a while for me to be sure that this is what's going on. In the past, I've generally thought there might be another explanation when I get lethargic. (Overheated that week? Must've been the heat that made me lethargic! Etc.) But it's becoming increasingly clear that my lethargic phases start by themselves without any particular trigger, and when I'm in a lethargic phase, even things that normally excite me don't get me out of it.

I have a lot of mental skills that can help me – my skills allow me to get everyday tasks done even when I'm lethargic, and they keep me from getting too distressed. But none of my skills let me bring back my creative motivation when I just don't have it. I'm in the process of seeing if there are medications that can help, but I haven't had much success with that yet.

The timeline of my current lethargic phase looks like this:

November 1: The last day when I was productive (writing a bit of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a>) as the phase began.

November 15: I started writing a good blog post. I wrote about 300 words of it, but then got burnt out and wasn't able to write more.

Today, November 22: I wrote another 350 words of the post, making it about half finished, then burnt out again. Later today, I also wrote <em>this</em> post, which was another sign of improvement, even though it was an easier task (I'm not trying to craft this post as carefully).

I feel like I'm at the beginning of my transition back into my productive phase, so if I'm lucky, this'll be my last "whoops I didn't do much this week" post for a while.

I've also been continuing to draw for 10 minutes once a day – I tried to increase the amount, but then I coincidentally got physically sick, which tends to make my hand muscles less resilient. So there's still hope that I can ramp it up again. And it's still good news that I've managed to maintain that amount, even if it's small.

Maybe you're someone with a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_empathy">affective empathy</a> – when you sense other people having feelings, you have a lot of feelings yourself. Or maybe you're more like me, and don't have so much.

A lot of people talk as if <strong>empathy</strong> is the same thing as <strong>goodness</strong>. Maybe you've said some things like that yourself without thinking about it. In this line of thinking, saying that someone has no empathy is the same as saying they're an evil person. Naturally, this bugs me because I don't want to be called an evil person. But there are also some subtler problems that you might not think of at first:
<ul class="big_list">
<li>If being empathetic is automatically good, that makes it harder to talk about how empathy might lead you to hurt people – and how to avoid that problem.</li>
<li>If being unempathetic is automatically bad, that forces unempathetic people to <em>pretend</em> to be empathetic, instead of learning the unique ways of doing good that are easier without empathy.
</ul>

<h2>How to stop your empathy from hurting people</h2>

If you feel someone else's distress, it can motivate you to help them. Helping people is good! Unfortunately, empathetic people can also have a hard time <em>coping</em> with others' distress. And I've seen a lot of coping strategies that actually end up hurting other people.

You may have used some of these yourself. They're not <em>good</em>, but they are understandable responses. If these sound like you, I hope to offer you a better way rather than judging you harshly.

<h3>Avoiding</h3>

Alice and Bob are friends. Alice has been <cut>upset about something for a long time. Bob is very empathetic, and has been listening to Alice's woes and providing emotional support. Even when Bob is tired, ze feels like ze needs to keep helping Alice. But finally, Bob gets overwhelmed. So Bob starts avoiding Alice entirely, so that ze doesn't have to deal with Alice's distress.

Worse yet, because Bob thinks it's <em>wrong</em> to avoid Alice, Bob feels like ze needs to come up with a <em>justification</em> for avoiding Alice. Bob comes up with this: "Alice is just a negative person who will always drag other people down, no matter how much you try to help." When Bob gives this justification to other people, that implicitly encourages other people to avoid helping Alice, too. Alice gets more isolated, which makes things worse.

Notice that everything Bob does here is motivated by empathy! But no one says "people in society are too empathetic, and that's why suffering people are isolated".

So, what can you do instead? You might be thinking "Don't make cruel justifications", which would be a good change, but it doesn't fix the whole problem. I'd like to focus on something near the beginning – Bob's decision to keep helping Alice even when Bob was already tired. At that moment, Bob is thinking, "Alice needs help". But Bob hasn't thought ahead to the rest of what will happen if Bob burns zemself out, which actually makes things <em>worse</em> for Alice. At this point, it would be a better to think "It looks like this is going to be an ongoing situation. Is the way I'm supporting Alice sustainable for me? What ways can I support Alice without burning out?" After thinking about this, you might say something like, "Alice, I absolutely think you deserve support on this, but I'm starting to get overwhelmed. I can still listen when we meet on Saturday, but I'll definitely get burned out if we keep talking about this issue every day. And if I get burned out, I won't be able to help <em>you</em> with it, either."




<h3>Denying</h3>

Alice tells Bob that something terrible has happened. Bob is not sure whether to believe it. If ze did believe it, it would be very painful. Worse yet, Bob feels like ze would have to do something about the situation. So Bob refuses to believe it, and claims that Alice is lying or deluded.

Sometimes, you <em>are</em> obligated to help, like if you're a schoolteacher and a child reports being assaulted. In that case, there's no way out of it – you're also obligated to believe (or at least make a reasonable investigation). But a lot of the time, you don't have a specific obligation – it's just that your empathy may make you feel like you do.

Lots of people need much more help than they're getting, and it's good that you want to fix that! But if you feel obligated to help every time someone needs help, then people needing help can start to feel threatening. (<q>Curses, I think that person will need my help! I hate how I'm going to get stuck with helping them!</q>) Figure out what your limits are. If helping someone would go beyond your limits, keep in mind that you can always choose not to help, or just to help in a smaller way. That way, you can safely <em>learn</em> about people who need help, without it becoming a threat to you.


<h3>Helping impatiently</h3>

Alice asks Bob for help with a problem. Bob is immediately distressed about the problem, and tries to fix it as fast as possible. But Bob's fix doesn't work, and maybe even makes things worse. Now Alice and Bob are both more upset.

Bob might have been able to solve the problem if ze thought about it more. But Bob's empathetic distress actually made it harder to think about the problem, so ze picked a quick fix instead.

Another issue goes more like this: Bob fixes Alice's immediate problem correctly. Bob expects Alice to feel better, but Alice doesn't feel much better because the immediate problem was part of a larger issue that's still a problem. Bob gets frustrated because Bob had been relying on Alice to feel better so that Bob could feel better. Then Bob blames that frustration on Alice.

In both cases, empathetic distress helps <em>motivate</em> you to help with a problem, but also makes it harder to find a solution that will actually help everybody. If you're feeling overwhelmed by your empathy, find a way to get some distance so you can think about what the best response is and what you're actually trying to get out of the situation.


<h2>How to do good by having less empathy</h2>

<p class="hidden_from_restricted_users">While I was writing this post, I talked to my friend Nikki about it. Nikki mentioned that I had never acted like we were <em>supposed</em> to feel the same way about everything. To me, it's normal for something to upset another person, but not upset me. Nikki had been mistreated by many other people (probably empathetic people!) who said ze shouldn't be upset about the things ze was upset about. Those other people acted like they <em>were</em> supposed to feel the same way, so if Nikki was upset about something that they wouldn't be upset about, there must be something wrong with Nikki.</p>

Being less empathetic allows me to <em>care</em> about someone else's feelings without <em>feeling</em> them myself.

I've also read that medical students become much less empathetic during medical school. I've always seen this presented as a bad thing, but I think it can be good as well as bad. Doctors have to talk to lots of people who have serious problems and may be in great distress. It's logical and helpful for them to avoid absorbing all that distress themselves. The only problem is if they also lose the ability to understand patients and make patients feel cared for.

Now, it's understandable that that will happen to some extent. When you grow up with a lot of affective empathy, you get used to caring for people <em>in the context of feeling empathy for them</em>. So a lot of your skills and habits of caring are specific to that context. If you distance yourself from your empathy later, your skills and habits won't necessarily apply to the new context. To remain a caring person, you have to adapt your skills or learn new ones.

For doctors, the ideal result isn't "prevent the reduction of empathy". Instead, it's "doctors should develop <em>new</em> skills, to understand and care for patients <em>without</em> depending on feelings."

This is also a useful skill for empathetic people! You'll inevitably meet some people whose feelings you genuinely don't understand. So it's not good if the <em>only</em> way you can care for people is when you share their feelings.

Now, for me in particular, I didn't have much empathy in the first place, so I had to learn the "care without feeling" skills the first time. I can't give <em>every</em> type of support – for instance, some people are looking for a response like "I'm so sad for you! Let's be sad together". I can't provide that. But I <em>can</em> be a stable confidant who will never be overwhelmed or scared by the strength of people's feelings. And I can also remain calm in a crisis even if everyone else is overwhelmed. We less-empathetic people are ideally suited to situations where other people are in lots of pain, as long as we have something else motivating us to keep helping.

Unfortunately, that's not how it's portrayed in society. We don't teach unempathetic kids how they can use their unique abilities to help others. When I was a kid, I did find <em>some</em> people who were actually proud of their lack of empathy – but those were rationalists who thought emotionality was irrational and liked to tell other people they were wrong about stuff. I'm afraid I picked up some of their behaviors at the time. I was kind of judgmental towards emotional people when I was a kid, even when I was trying to be nice to them.

Now that I've figured out a better way, I hope to be a good example to unempathetic people in the future.

I've been doing significantly better this week. I'm nowhere near full energy yet, but I've been able to start getting things done to a certain extent.

In particular, I'm working on music composition software again! It's even technically usable already – I can arrange musical notes on the screen and have it play the music or save it to a file. But it's still very much in "only the author of this incomplete program would understand how to use it" territory. And I haven't quite gotten to using it to write music that I would actually want to share.

I've also been slowly but steadily doing more drawing. Now I have 5 comic pages with complete line drawings. I haven't been able to increase from 10 minutes a day yet, because of one thing and another, but it's still something.

On the same day I said I was feeling better, I started feeling a bunch worse again. I think there might be a feedback loop where when I start feeling better, I get excited and do a bunch of work, but then I'm not actually up to it and I get burned out again. I don't think this loop is actually <em>bad</em> (like I'm not hurting myself, I just have limited total energy, and I happen to spend it in that pattern). But it does make things sort of unpredictable.

The next day, I started taking tianeptine, an atypical antidepressant. It's definitely been making me feel better, although it's hard to tell yet whether it's treating the underlying problem. I might write sometime about the subtleties of its effects, but I don't have the energy to do that right now, since I already did a bunch of work today.

Specifically, today, I did manage to write another thousand words or so in chapter 4 of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a> – the first time I've managed to work on it since November 1. It's up to about 2800 words now!

I'm feeling much better!

This Sunday, my brain decided to get interested in <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/time-steward">TimeSteward</a> again. That's a huge project, so I didn't think I'd be up to it, but then it turned out I was! I've been working on it since then. I still have to be careful not to overdo it, but I've also been succeeding at being careful, so overall this is looking like a great success.

I've also been intermittently working on Chapter 4 of <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a> (up to 3400 words) and my comics (up to 6 completed line drawings).

My energy levels have been up and down a lot in the last week. On average, they've been significantly more "up" than they have been in a while, and I've continued getting stuff done on <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/time-steward">TimeSteward</a>. On the other hand, I don't really have control over which days I'll be productive and which days I won't. I've also tried to channel the energy into other projects, but it's just not working yet.

A few days ago, I got nostalgic about a couple of old strategy games that I played many years ago. This got me excited about game design again! So I went ahead and made <a href="/games/rustweb-test-game">this simple prototype of a real-time strategy game.</a> There's no actual controls yet (you just watch the game spawn little dots that shoot at each other), but hey.

I'm doing loads better on the mental health side, too! I've been consistently close to a fairly normal level of motivation to do the stuff I want to do. I'm especially hoping to break my long stall on <a href="/ravelling-wrath">Ravelling Wrath</a> – I actually expect to get back to work on it within the next few days.

For the computer programmers among you, the game linked above is written using <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/time-steward">TimeSteward</a>, my game/simulation library. It also has <a href="https://github.com/elidupree/rustweb-test-game">a git repository here</a>, and it uses <a href="https://github.com/koute/stdweb">the Rust stdweb library</a> – it's written mainly in Rust and then compiled to the web, with small bits of JavaScript embedded in the Rust code. This makes it <strong>much</strong> more convenient for me to write games for the web, since it lets me write the main game in Rust (my favorite programming language) without having to make a clunky compatibility layer. Finding a way to do this has been one of my long-term goals. It should help me finally make a bigger collection of games to put on my games page.

"tags": ["game design"],

In Hearthstone, there's a card called <strong>Auchenai Soulpriest</strong>. It turns all your healing spells into damage spells. It also has a 3/5 body, and it costs 4 mana. (If you don't know Hearthstone, that's okay – for this post, all you need to know is that bigger numbers are better, and spending more mana is worse.)

Auchenai Soulpriest is a well-balanced card.

But there's another card, <strong>Embrace the Shadow</strong>, that does exactly the same thing, except that it costs 2 mana, only lasts one turn, and doesn't have a body at all. So when you play Auchenai Soulpriest, it's like you're playing Embrace the Shadow and also paying 2 extra mana for a 3/5 body (and a chance for the effect to last longer). Adding a 3/5 for 2 mana is normally an outrageously good deal. You'd normally have to pay 4 mana for that. So it seems like Auchenai Soulpriest was balanced as if Embrace the Shadow was a <strong>zero</strong> mana card. Why?

Here's why: The strongest way to use the "healing becomes damage" effect is to "heal" your opponent a lot at once, killing them in one turn. (And the one-turn kill strategy doesn't care about the 3/5 body, because it's already won the game.) For the one-turn kill strategy, 2 mana is a fair cost to pay for the effect. With any <em>other</em> strategy, 0 mana would be a fair cost.

<h2>Specialized and unspecialized value</h2>

I'm going to define some terms here. 2 mana is the <strong>specialized value</strong> of the "healing becomes damage" effect, and 0 mana is the <strong>generic value</strong> of the effect. The <strong>specialized value</strong> is the value assuming that you've designed the rest of your strategy to take advantage of it. The <strong>generic value</strong> is the value if you just throw it into a random strategy.

<p>(Technically, there's actually a 2-dimensional graph here, to represent the value depending on how <em>much</em> you specialize the rest of your strategy.)</p>

The specialized value is <em>always</em> greater than the generic value, by definition. (If it doesn't get stronger, you didn't actually specialize around it.) But cards can differ in how <em>big</em> the difference is. In the absolute worst case (a deck with <em>no</em> healing), Auchenai Soulpriest is still a 4 mana 3/5, which is mediocre but usable. But Embrace the Shadow does literally nothing. Thus, Embrace the Shadow is a much more <strong>specialized card</strong>. It has a steeper graph.

Let's say you're the game designer here. If you make Embrace the Shadow cost <em>less</em> than 2, the one-turn kill strategy will be too powerful. But if you make it cost 2, no one will ever play it <em>except</em> in the one-turn kill strategy. And that's usually not what you want. (I'll explain why later in the post.) This is an inherent problem with any card that is too specialized.

So what do you do about it?

Well, a body with no abilities is a supremely <strong>generic</strong> effect – it's moderately helpful for almost any strategy. When you combine the two of them, you get a card that's somewhere in the middle. When you want to use it for the specialized part, you have to pay for the whole package. That way, it can afford to have a <strong>high cost</strong>, which it needs in order to keep the specialized strategy balanced, while still being worth the cost in general. If Embrace the Shadow's value ranges from 0 to 2 based on how specialized your strategy is, Auchenai Soulpriest's value ranges from 3 to 4, which is much less extreme.

I did a similar thing when designing Era of High Sorcery (EoHS), my mod for Battle for Wesnoth. EoHS isn't a card game, but both Hearthstone and EoHS are games where the player can choose how to combine different game abilities. In Hearthstone, you choose 30 cards to put in your deck. In EoHS, you spend 11 skill points on skills of your choice, such as knowledge of specific magic spells.

In EoHS, there's a spell that can temporarily paralyze one enemy. The best use of paralysis is to paralyze the enemy leader so that you can kill them, winning the game. Because that's very powerful, the spell has to cost 20 mana, which is a lot. But for 20 mana, it's totally wasteful to paralyze anything <em>except</em> the enemy leader. If the spell is wasteful in most situations, it's less fun to play with.

So what did I do about it? I made the spell be <strong>Lightning Bolt</strong>, which also does lots of damage as well as causing paralysis. In EoHS, enemy leaders are immune to spell damage, so the spell can be worth a similar amount either way. On leaders, it's just paralysis, which is worth 20 mana. On other enemies, it's paralysis (worth much less than 20) <em>plus</em> a bunch of damage (worth the rest of the 20). It's <strong>less specialized</strong>, which makes it usable in more situations.

Why is this such a good thing? Well…

<h2>The purpose of game balance</h2>

What's the purpose of game balance?

People often assume it's to make all cards/skills/whatever equally powerful. But that would be easy – just make them all the same. So we need some understanding of what the player <em>wants</em> from the game that creates the <em>need</em> for balance. And one important thing they want is variety.

Try this definition on for size: The purpose of game balance is <strong>to maximize the number of meaningfully distinct strategies per design labor.</strong>

In a competitive game, if your strategy is too weak, you always lose against opponents who use good strategies. So it fails to be <strong>meaningfully distinct</strong> from every other strategy that also always loses. The same thing can happen in a difficult single-player game, where only a narrow range of strategies can win. On the other hand, in a sandbox game, the player can do any different thing they want without the risk of losing. Sandbox games don't <em>need</em> game balance, because they can have lots of variety and don't have to worry about power levels. The tricky thing for a designer is to make a game that has both variety <em>and</em> a challenge.

Now things start to make sense. As a game designer, letting the player recombine abilities can be a big bonus. That way, you only have to design a fixed number of abilities, but the number of strategies will be vastly bigger, because every combination of different abilities as a different strategy. It lets you get much more than "1 design labor = 1 strategy".

Well… ideally.

Let's go back to the example of Embrace the Shadow. Because it's so specialized, no one will ever play it <em>except</em> in the one-turn kill strategy. And in that case, your <em>entire</em> labor in creating Embrace the Shadow can only be used by <em>one</em> strategy. And then you're right back to "1 design labor = 1 strategy".
