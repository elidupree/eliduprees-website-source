"I've, been, thinking, and…"

Alchemist clearly had a lot weighing on them. Their eyes were puffy and their robes were matted down from the rain. They kept their hands clasped together right in front of their chest, their shoulders curled inwards. Yali and I waited for them to [????? figure out what to say].

"I know, what, you said. Morrow… his powers… we can't get near him without his powers, hurting us. But, what if…"

Alchemist swallowed.

"What if, he, didn't, <em>have</em>, his, powers?"

"But how?" I reacted.

"<em>The Broken God!</em> You, Yali, said, my, alchem –, my, powers, are, <em>parts of the Broken God stored in a physical medium</em>. And the god can do it! That's what I realized! It <em>ravels</em> into me, and then it <em>unravels</em> out of me! There's part of it that does the unravelling!"

I was about to say something, but Yali's hand squeezed my shoulder. I clamped my mouth shut and kept listening.

"So, if, maybe, the unravelling goes into a potion? And the potion goes into Morrow?"

We were all silent for a while, digesting that question.

"Is that <em>possible?</em>" I said. "I thought the Ravelling was, like, a special rule that even the gods have to follow! Like, the Blood God wouldn't even need to kill anyone if it could just 'unravel' the Farseer – one god shouldn't be able to remove a <em>different</em> god's threads –"

"If any god can do it, it's the Broken God," said Yali. "<em>When all plans fail and all hope seems lost, the Broken God finds a way forward,</em>" she intoned.

"Is that a Broken saying?" I asked.

"Actually, it's a Waiting saying."

"Oh duh, it refers to plans, haha. Wait, never mind that! You really think it's possible? This changes everything! If there was a potion like that, <em>I</em> could drink it and then the Blood God wouldn't – no, wait, <em>you</em> could drink it and then we'd have won without –"

"Rinn. Shhhh. We'll have time to discuss that later. You're forgetting Alchemist."

I looked back at Alchemist, who was still watching us nervously. "Shit, sorry. This is about Morrow, we've gotta think about Morrow first. So… what's the plan? Alchemist makes this… unravelling potion, and then…"

Alchemist drooped. "Oh… I didn't think…"

Yali said exhaustedly, "We <em>do</em> now have a way to safely bring it to him…"

"Oh yeah! I have my soulfire now! No one can stop me!" I was excited, but Yali didn't even crack a smile. "Yali, are you okay…?"

She clearly wasn't happy. "I hate that you're going to help him right after he abused you. I actually hate it," she said neutrally. "But at least this will stop him from putting us in danger. I can live with that."

<bigbreak>

Making the potion wasn't as simple as I had assumed.

"I, maybe, know how to make the potion. But… it needs…" Alchemist manifested a flask of water in their hand. "This… isn't, enough, it, needs…"

"A stronger medium," finished Yali. "Materials that are capable of holding such a powerful sorcery."

"Oh… you, maybe, understand it, better…"

"No. You're the one who told that to me. In the future. You explained a lot. You understand more than you know. You just have trouble putting it into words. So, if you'd like, I can fetch the words for you. Your own words, from the future."

"I, maybe, yes? I would, like that?"

The next bit of conversation was… certainly <em>interesting</em>. Alchemist kept saying something vague or even just waving their hand aimlessly, and every time, Yali filled in a clear, detailed description.

Up until now, Alchemist had mostly just manifested their potions directly. But if a potion was too powerful, manifested matter wouldn't be able to hold it. The same power that let the potion <em>do</em> what it was supposed to <em>do</em>, could also destabilize the matter that contained it. And this <em>particular</em> potion was even worse. It was specifically designed to mess with a person's soul. So, even when it was still in a bottle, it would constantly be trying to mess with any soul that touched it. And manifested matter wasn't technically part of your soul, but it was still <em>connected</em> to your soul – that's why you could unmanifest it. So we definitely needed to make the potion out of matter that came from the world, not from us.

"So, do we have to go find some clean water?" I said. "I was at a stream a while back –"

Yali stood up. "Not <em>just</em> water. Not for this. We'll have to go and search for ingredients."

Alchemist hesitantly followed her. "Do you, know, what, we're looking for?"

"I don't. But you'll recognize it when we get to it. So let's go, in, in, any direction, and just stop sometimes so that I can look in each direction and tell you whether we find anything that way in the future. Then we'll know which way to go."

<bigbreak>

It was a long walk, through a lot of mud. At first, I manifested a swath of fire to boil it away. Yali liked it, but it scared Alchemist. So then I just manifested a bunch of wooden boards to lay down over the mud. That worked for a while, but when it came time to use the Seeing, Yali asked me to stop manifesting to make it easier. So then we had to trudge through a lot of mud again. At least I had my nice boots now.

While we walked, we also filled in Alchemist on everything that had happened since they left.
[????? Summary language: setting off to look for ingredients, and also telling Alchemist about the revelations from last chapter

At last, we came to a spot where Yali saw something in the future. She pointed Alchemist to the general area where they had found something, then let them lead the way.

Alchemist led us to a tiny brook and knelt down next to it. They lowered their hands into the water, kneading the thick clay from the streambed and drawing up handfuls of it into a little sack.

"Solid… But it needs…"

"The clay will stabilize the potion. Without the clay, the energy from the sorcery might be released prematurely or damage other parts of the medium. But the clay isn't receptive to magic by itself. With <em>only</em> the clay, the sorcery wouldn't stay in potion form, it would float away into the air. So we'll also need –"

"Okay, that's nice, but," I said, "Morrow's going to have to drink a bottle of clay??"

"Maybe, if…"

Yali looked into the future. "It can be diluted. Not with water, but with, with, oil."

"How are we gonna get oil?"

"Let me look something up." Yali pulled out her phone.

Suddenly we had to do a lot of research. Yali opened the local encyclopedia on her phone and started looking up ways you could extract oil from plants. To give the rest of us something to do, she also manifested two copies of her phone so both of us could look in the encyclopedia, too.

"Remember, I can see if you look at anything private," she said as put one of the copies into my hand.

"Oh gods, did I do that in the future?"

Yali chuckled. "Don't worry about it."

Not that I was much use. I looked up a bunch of plants, but I didn't find anything about extracting oil. Then I found an article about a giant, enchanted plant that ate people. That kept me distracted for a while. ?????

Eventually, Yali found what she was looking for. Of course, the plants we needed didn't seem to be growing anywhere around here. But after a long discussion, Yali and Alchemist agreed that they could use Alchemist's powers to <em>grow</em> the plants they needed. Regular manifesting wouldn't work, but the Broken God could cheat plants out of nowhere. Even then, it was too similar to manifested matter, but if they just started with seedlings and let them grow the rest of the way from the soil, most of the matter would be from the soil, so it would work.

So that's what they did. Alchemist wiggled their fingers into the dirt, coaxing little stems out from the ground. Then they cupped their hands around the new sprouts. Before long, the plants were going absurdly fast, stems and leaves shooting up to be almost as tall as we were, and the ground shifting subtly up and down as the roots spread into the surrounding earth.

Meanwhile, I set to work trying to make a bottle, because the container couldn't be made of manifested matter either. First I tried to make a clay bottle. But shaping the clay into a bottle was a huge pain. <em>Layo</em> could've probably done it, but all I got was a lopsided bowl. Just to see what would happen, I tried to fire the bowl by manifesting it to be really hot, but it just cracked into pieces. So I gave up and tried to make a bottle out of wood instead. I cut down a tree and hollowed out a chunk of it with my Blood Blades. The first few times I tried, I accidentally put holes through it, but eventually I got the hang of it. And the Blood Blades were razor-sharp when I needed them to be, so it worked out fairly easily. Pretty soon, I had a whole row of asymmetric wooden jars and bottles in front of me.

While I was doing that, Yali and Alchemist harvested the seeds from their big plants. Once we had the seeds, then we had to press them. Yali found some diagrams of a big metal press for extracting the oil. Of course, we had to build it piece by piece based on the pictures, because none of us had imprinted anything like that. We didn't do a great job of it, and we ended up with bits of seeds mixed into the oil. But it was good enough.

Next up was the ingredient that was "receptive to magic". Once again, Yali looked up a plant with the right magical properties, and Alchemist grew it. This time, it was a sprawling bramble bush, with little, dark reddish berries speckled between its thorns. Alchemist and Yali got to work hunting the brambles for berries that were just the right ripeness. They weren't paying much attention to me. So I idly picked a few of the berries and ate them.

Flavor exploded in my mouth, stabbing wildly down along my jaw and up behind my nostrils. They were the absolute WORST thing I had EVER tasted. I immediately reached for some more.

"Don't eat too many of those, they're poisonous," said Yali casually, not bothering to look back at me.

"Whaaaaat?!"

Yali chuckled. "As long as you only eat a few, your natural manifesting will keep you from getting sick."

"Oooookay," I said, dropping the ones I was holding.

?????

<bigbreak>

Finally, we had everything assembled.

"You'll have to take it from here," said Yali to Alchemist. "I can't See anything after you start making the potion."

Alchemist nodded and closed their mouth. Then they closed their eyes, too. They set one of my wooden jars on the ground in front of them. After a short pause, they dipped one hand into the mixture, then the other hand. With oily clay coating their hands, they reached into the air, their fingers curling like someone playing a harp.

The haze stabbed into my head and heart. Lines of force flickered in the air, spreading out like lightning in slow motion, as if Alchemist was prying open fractures in the universe itself. It was almost painful to look at, but I couldn't look away. The feeling was way beyond the normal buzz of sorcery. Every time the lines flickered, it sent a jarring feeling through me, like it was trying to shake me to pieces. And in between, there was a terrible sense of unease, a doubt that anything I believed had ever been real.

Alchemist stopped.

Yali frantically muttered to me, "They're going to start again! We have to stay back!" She took my arm and hurried me away from where Alchemist was sitting. I couldn't resist glancing back as Alchemist started the process again. But Yali blocked me. "Don't look at it either! Don't pay attention to it!"

"But –"

"That, that, that stuff can take apart a human soul! We don't want our souls to get caught up in it! And if you pay attention to it, that makes you closer to it –"

Even when I looked away, the cracks in the universe were still sizzling in the back of my mind. "How do I 'not pay attention' to <em>that</em>?!"

"I, I, I –" Yali looked around wildly. Then, without warning, she shoved me by the shoulders. I stumbled backwards. 

"Woah, what –"

In moments, Yali had pinned me with my back to a tree. She leaned in and kissed me on the mouth. "I'm distracting you," she said.

"You sure know how to distract me," I laughed, thrills running through me as she planted a series of kisses starting at my ear and moving up the side of my face. I pulled closer to her, grabbing fistfuls of her sweater and diving into clamped my lips onto hers. We pushed back and forth, squishing our bodies onto each other, barely remembering to come up for air.

At some point, I noticed that I didn't feel like the world was being torn apart anymore. And that Alchemist was looking at us.

I peeled myself off of Yali, laughing and straightening my shirt. "Oh, hey there, Alchemist, haha, how did it go?"

Alchemist hesitated, then waved for us to come look. They led us to where they'd been working. The wooden jar sat alone on a mat on the ground, not looking like much. Its lid was closed tight, and I couldn't feel anything from it.

Yali took one look at it. "So it worked? It's stable?"

Alchemist hesitated again, then nodded.

"The Seeing is working again. That's good…" She looked into the future for a while. "I can See up until when Morrow drinks the potion, then it's all blank again."

"Why?" I asked.

"The unravelling potion is supposed to be impossible. It breaks all the rules of the Ravelling. So it's no surprise the Waiting God can't see past it. But that doesn't make things any easier for me…" She sighed. "I guess we should be concerned what'll happen to Morrow after he drinks it. If the Seeking God is all that's keeping him going, then when it's taken away from him… He might pass out, his injuries might be more dangerous to him…"

[????? consider possibly cutting this next bit if it doesn't have great promises]

"What injuries?" I said without thinking. "Oh, right."

"If Rinn is bringing, one potion to him…?" mumbled Alchemist.

"Oh yeah, I could bring a healing potion too –"

"You have a hard time convincing him to drink even one potion!" said Yali.

We launched into yet another argument about what to do. Right when I was in the middle of arguing, Alchemist sprayed me in the face with a spray bottle of water. I was completely flabbergasted.

"Oh… I didn't, mean to, hit you…"

????? "Wait, are you thinking, a spray-on healing potion?" I said. "Wait, can we spray on the unravelling potion?!"

"No, that one needs to be completely absorbed," said Yali. "But a healing potion might, might, be able to be more, more superficial."

<bigbreak>

So there we were, trekking through the wilderness to track down Morrow, equipped with spray bottles full of healing potions and the jar with the unravelling potion.

It wasn't hard to follow him. Even a <em>normal</em> person could have spotted all the manifested junk he left behind him. And to Yali, it was even more obvious. We followed him through the woods, the terrain getting rougher and rougher. The further we went, the more downhill it got. Before long, we started having to detour sideways so we didn't end up sliding down the steep, muddy, rocky slopes.

From the look of things, <em>Morrow</em> had slid straight down them.

I squinted across at a short smear of blood on the rocks. "Should there be this much blood?" I said. "I mean, there's not, like, lakes of it, but we've been following him for a while, so it adds up –"

"It's manifesting. His wounds aren't healing because I did them with hostile intent and damaged his soul. But he unconsciously manifests more blood to replace what is lost."

"Oh gods, what if he loses all his original blood and then he gets back to Earth and –"

"That's what the healing potion is for," said Yali bluntly.

"Right…"

We descended to the mouth of a ravine, guarded by a tall, blackened tree with splotches of blood on its trunk. Morrow must have paused to rest here. Yali stopped walking and squinted. "Do you feel it, too?" she said.

I stopped alongside her. When I paid attention, I could feel something sloshing at the edges of my mind. "Yeah. I do."

"We're getting close. This is where we stay behind, and you go on alone."

"Right…"

"You've got this."

I laughed. It came out louder than I expected. "That's pretty reassuring, coming from someone who can literally see the future."

"Don't get careless."

"Fine. What do I have to look out for?"

"…don't lose your cool if he hurts himself. Just hold onto your soulfire. It's rare, but if you lose it, I have to step in to protect you. Then you're okay, but Morrow is dead for real."

"Well, shit."

"Yeah. You ready?"

"Alright, let's do this thing." I threw my head back and howled into the air, letting off a flare of my soulfire into the air around me. Then I tightened it back into a steady burn, a warm, invulnerable glow from every part of my [????? skin? No, because it comes from the interior]. I grinned. I still couldn't get over how <em>awesome</em> it felt to fill myself with soulfire. "See you both soon!" I declared. Then I hurried onwards.

As I got closer, the forest swam around me. It felt like the world was unstable, trying to make me forget which way was up and down. But from inside my soulfire, it didn't seem so threatening. I was a transcendent pillar of flame. I knew exactly where <em>I</em> was. It was just the rest of the world that was having trouble.

?????

Morrow must have heard me, because he tried to turn around. But somehow, he only managed to trip over his own feet and go sprawling into the wall of the ravine [????? set that up]. I rushed to help him, but almost as soon as he had gone down, he lunged to his feet again, his grinning, battered face swaying towards me.

Yali had <em>seriously</em> fucked him up. Like, I'd beaten up plenty of assholes myself. And I had gotten beat up plenty of times too. But I had never seen someone messed up <em>this</em> bad. One eye was completely swollen shut, and the other one wasn't looking much better. His nose was sticking off in the wrong direction, dripping a mass of blood right down his chin. His hands were messed up too, fingers torn up and sticking off in all the wrong directions.

I immediately wanted to ?????, but that wasn't what I was here for. I knew what I had to do. "Morrow! I've got something for you."

Morrow's one working eye wavered back and forth, never quite focusing in on me.




?????

[????? Rinn returning with Morrow]

I saw Yali and Alchemist already standing to greet me. Yali looked way different than she had when I left. ?????. And she had a new broad belt with loads of potions hanging from it. ????

"What's up with all the gear?" I called out.

"Preparations for when we confront Justicar," she said firmly.

"Oh yeah, that's a good point."

When I got close, Alchemist hurried to check on Morrow. It was pretty awkward with me still carrying him over my shoulder. "Oy, let me put him down first!" I said. I shoved Alchemist back a bit, manifested a mattress and slung Morrow down onto it.

As Alchemist crouched over him to check his vital signs, Yali looked down at Morrow contemptfully. She frowned. "I don't believe there is any risk that I will attack him again," she said, "but things will be much easier if he is kept a good distance away from me after he wakes up."

[????? Is this the right place for Rinn to complain about Yali hating Morrow more than Justicar? Or should this go in the final chapter?]

"Seriously, though, what's up with you hating Morrow more than Justicar? I mean, when you talk about Justicar, it's always '?????' and 'we must be prepared to confront her', but with Morrow it's 'maybe he SHOULD be killed!' and 'so I'm probably not going to murder him, like, RELUCTANTLY' – I mean, I get that what Morrow did was bad, but Justicar almost KILLED me! Her sword was literally in my chest!"

"<em>Forty-five minutes,</em>" said Yali angrily. "That's how long it took me, running as hard as I could, to get to you before Morrow did too much damage. I know because I checked my phone while I ran to make sure I was pacing myself the right amount. Justicar took me by surprise! I didn't have time to be upset. But I had to watch for forty-five minutes while Morrow abused you. Forty-five minutes of cursing myself for not getting an extra Severing Step from Alchemist when I had the chance. And I'm not like you. I can't be angry at someone and then forgive them with my next breath. It doesn't matter what I believe now. I will hate the face of Morrow for as long as I live."

"Woah, that's… I mean, shit."

"I'm not done. There is another reason. Morrow has always been like the ?????s. Temperamental, clinging to obsessions to cover up his pain. But –"

"Hey, <em>I'm</em> temperamental. Morrow's kind of a mess, but –"

"For my <em>entire life</em> I have had to clean up other people's messes! ????? But Justicar… Justicar is like <em>me</em>."

"Are you kidding me," I said.

????? Both of us will sacrifice anything to achieve our goals. Both of us will destroy anyone we have to. The only difference is that Justicar will stop at the gods, and I will not."

????? The Stern doesn't have to be about sacrificing what you care about just to be obedient to someone else. It can also be about sacrificing… unimportant things… to get what you truly want.



?????

A few hours later, Alchemist wandered back to us, leaving Morrow out ahead.

Dry leaves blew past on a chilly wind, clearing the dust and fog from the air. Our boots were covered in mud from walking over slimy ground. ?????

"I don't know what to do," said Alchemist despondently. "I don't know what to say… He's…" They gestured vaguely in the air. Floating leaves formed into a picture of Morrow, sprawled out and twisted into several pieces. I knew instantly what it meant.

"Have fun with that," muttered Yali.

"I'll go talk to him," I said tiredly.

Beside me, Yali stiffened.

"Look, he can't hurt me again even if he wanted to. He was helpless to my soulfire even when he <em>had</em> his powers. Now he's just, like, some loser."

"Fine. Go. Just don't make me think about it."

?????

Morrow half-startled. After a moment, he looked back at me. "Oh. It's you."

Something <em>instantly</em> seemed off about him. His reaction was way slower than usual, and his words came out slower, too. He seemed… glum? At first I thought that was super weird. I'd seen him ripping himself apart, but I'd never seen him just regular sad, or any sort of less-energetic mood at all. Then I thought, <em>of course</em>! He didn't have the Seeking God inside him anymore. It had probably been the Seeking God that was keeping him going the whole time. And now…

"How are you, uh, feeling?" I said.

[????? somewhere: how Alchemist is the only one who hasn't hurt anybody, and how both the blood and waiting will trample over the broken to get what they want]



[????? Should I use the unraveling potion?; where in this chapter? probably near the end?]

"That <em>is</em> what I would have told you to do, as recently as the third layer…" said Yali. "But now… I am starting to think that the Blood God <em>should</em> rejuvenate."

"But…" I said. Even after all the revelations we'd just found out, that was still ?????. "I mean, I don't want to say Justicar was right, but, what if Justicar was right? Even though I was [????? justified] – I mean, even though the Blood God was [????? justified in trying to get revenge], it's still been lashing out all over the place." Even as I said it, though, I started to doubt it myself. When I really thought about it, the Blood God <em>hadn't</em> been lashing out at anyone except Yali. If anything, I'd had <em>more</em> empathy for everyone else. It had even marked Justicar as "not my real enemy". <em>Justicar!</em>

Yali spoke gravely. "The Blood God is a god of anger, and it has been starving for the last 70 years. So, are people less angry now? No, of course not. Anger has always been a part of, of, of humanity, of humans. The only difference is that now, their anger isn't being <em>overseen</em>. They don't have a god to… to bring meaning to their anger, to guide it to a better purpose." ????? "Besides… even if we did want to, we still shouldn't do it <em>yet</em>. Your soulfire is one of the only powers that can pierce Justicar's armor."

"I'll have to kill her…" I said. I swallowed. "?????!"

"It may be necessary," said Yali gravely.

[?????"Well, fuck." I looked down at my hands. wait no, more aggressive: "Fuck!" I yelled. "[I fight people a lot but I never wanted to actually kill anyone]!"] "<em>May</em> be, though? You think we can get away without a fight?"

"The final portal won't open until the conflict is resolved. But there are other possibilities. She doesn't have to <em>die</em> if she can be persuaded to take the unravelling potion herself –"

"– like that's gonna happen –"

"– and it doesn't have to be <em>you</em> who bears the burden. Alchemi–"

"No FUCKING way!!! We are NOT making ALCHEMIST fight our –"

"–st would be capable of <em>creating</em> a weapon that <em>I</em> could use to –"

"Still no! I'll just do it myself, we are <em>not</em> getting Alchemist involved in this! They are SOFT and SWEET and – gods, Yali, how could you even <em>think</em> of such a thing?!"

Yali shouted back, "Me thinking of things that hurt people is why you're still alive right now!"

"Yeah, but not like <em>this</em> –"

"Yes, like this! <em>Exactly</em> like this! When I saw Justicar draw her sword on you, my first thought was, 'what powers do I need so I can get there and save you?' And my second thought was '<em>how loud do I have to yell at Alchemist so they'll be scared enough to hurry up and do what I say, but not scared enough to mess it up?</em>' If I had wasted time thinking about how to be <em>nice</em> to them, you would be <em>dead</em> right now! If I hadn't forced them to try and make a weapon back then, I wouldn't have had anything to bluff her with! So don't <em>ever</em> tell me not to think about something because it's too cruel! I have <em>always</em> been the one who does what has to be done, when no one else will!"

I had wanted to argue back, but against the thunder of her words, I didn't feel like I could say anything at all. It was the first time she had ever aimed the full force of her anger and judgment directly towards me. It wasn't like I couldn't handle it, but… shit. I could finally understand how she was the same person who had bullied another kid into a nervous wreck. And at the same time, that terrifying power, lurking right under the surface… It was part of why I'd always loved her, why I couldn't get enough of her.

And the worst part was, she wasn't wrong.

"Well… fuck," I said. "

?????

"But, we don't have to force Alchemist to make a weapon this time. We have time. And I have my soulfire. I can do it. Waiting knows I'm the one who deserves to." I laughed hollowly. "I guess I shouldn't be using that saying anymore, should I…"

"It's okay. I understand."

?????

[????? Is there anything else we need to discuss before we go to the next world]

"We still haven't talked about… When I made you do the Controlling Game. When –"

"Oh gods, don't remind me," I said.

"Remember, I, I promised I'd check in with you, to make sure –"

"Uh, yeah, you were totally fine. I was being a huge asshole, I'm glad you stopped me."
