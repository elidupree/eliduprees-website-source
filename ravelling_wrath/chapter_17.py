"I've, been, thinking, and…"

Alchemist clearly had a lot weighing on them. [????? Physical description; both of us waited for them to continue]

"I know, what, you said. Morrow… his powers… we can't get near him without his powers, hurting us. But, what if…"

Alchemist swallowed.

"What if, he, didn't, <em>have</em>, his, powers?"

"Is that <em>possible?</em>" I reacted.

"<em>The Broken God!</em> You, Yali, said, my, Alchem –, my, powers, are, <em>parts of the Broken God stored in a physical medium</em>. And the god can do it! That's what I realized! It <em>ravels</em> into me, and then it <em>unravels</em> out of me! There's part of it that does the unravelling!"

I was about to say something, but Yali's hand squeezed my shoulder. I clamped my mouth shut and kept listening.

"So, if, maybe, the unravelling goes into a potion? And the potion goes into Morrow?"

?????

"<em>When all plans fail and all ?????, the Broken God sees a way forward,</em>" Yali intoned.

"Is that a Broken saying?" I asked.

"Actually, it's a Waiting saying."
