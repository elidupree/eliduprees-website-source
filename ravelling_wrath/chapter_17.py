"I've, been, thinking, and…"

Alchemist clearly had a lot weighing on them. Their eyes were puffy and their robes were matted down from the rain. They kept their hands clasped together right in front of their chest, their shoulders curled inwards. Yali and I waited for them to [????? figure out what to say].

"I know, what, you said. Morrow… his powers… we can't get near him without his powers, hurting us. But, what if…"

Alchemist swallowed.

"What if, he, didn't, <em>have</em>, his, powers?"

"But how?" I reacted.

"<em>The Broken God!</em> You, Yali, said, my, alchem –, my, powers, are, <em>parts of the Broken God stored in a physical medium</em>. And the god can do it! That's what I realized! It <em>ravels</em> into me, and then it <em>unravels</em> out of me! There's part of it that does the unravelling!"

I was about to say something, but Yali's hand squeezed my shoulder. I clamped my mouth shut and kept listening.

"So, if, maybe, the unravelling goes into a potion? And the potion goes into Morrow?"

We were all silent for a while, digesting that question.

"Is that <em>possible?</em>" I said. "I thought the Ravelling was, like, a special rule that even the gods have to follow! Like, the Blood God wouldn't even need to kill anyone if it could just 'unravel' the Farseer – one god shouldn't be able to remove a <em>different</em> god's threads –"

"If any god can do it, it's the Broken God," said Yali. "<em>When all plans fail and all hope seems lost, the Broken God finds a way forward,</em>" she intoned.

"Is that a Broken saying?" I asked.

"Actually, it's a Waiting saying."

"Oh duh, it refers to plans, haha. Wait, never mind that! You really think it's possible? This changes everything! If there was a potion like that, <em>I</em> could drink it and then the Blood God wouldn't – no, wait, <em>you</em> could drink it and then we'd have won without –"

"Rinn. Shhhh. We'll have time to discuss that later. You're forgetting Alchemist."

I looked back at Alchemist, who was still watching us nervously. "Shit, sorry. This is about Morrow, we've gotta think about Morrow first. So… what's the plan? Alchemist makes this… unravelling potion, and then…"

Alchemist drooped. "Oh… I didn't think…"

Yali said exhaustedly, "We <em>do</em> now have a way to safely bring it to him…"

"Oh yeah! I have my soulfire now! No one can stop me!" I was excited, but Yali didn't even crack a smile. "Yali, are you okay…?"

She clearly wasn't happy. "I hate that you're going to help him right after he abused you. I actually hate it," she said neutrally. "But at least this will stop him from putting us in danger. I can live with that."

<bigbreak>

Making the potion wasn't as simple as I had assumed.

"I, maybe, know how to make the potion. But… it needs…" Alchemist manifested a flask of water in their hand. "This… isn't, enough, it, needs…"

"A stronger medium," finished Yali. "Materials that are capable of holding such a powerful sorcery."

"Oh… you, maybe, understand it, better…"

"No. You're the one who told that to me. In the future. You explained a lot. You understand more than you know. You just have trouble putting it into words. So, if you'd like, I can fetch the words for you. Your own words, from the future."

"I, maybe, yes? I would, like that?"

The next bit of conversation was… certainly <em>interesting</em>. Alchemist kept saying something vague or even just waving their hand aimlessly, and every time, Yali filled in a clear, detailed description.

Up until now, Alchemist had mostly just manifested their potions directly. But if a potion was too powerful, manifested matter wouldn't be able to hold it. The same power that let the potion <em>do</em> what it was supposed to <em>do</em>, could also destabilize the matter that contained it. And this <em>particular</em> potion was even worse. It was specifically designed to mess with a person's soul. So, even when it was still in a bottle, it would constantly be trying to mess with any soul that touched it. And manifested matter wasn't technically part of your soul, but it was still <em>connected</em> to your soul – that's why you could unmanifest it. So we definitely needed to make the potion out of matter that came from the world, not from us.

"So, do we have to go find some clean water?" I said. "I was at a stream a while back –"

Yali stood up. "Not <em>just</em> water. Not for this. We'll have to go and search for ingredients."

Alchemist hesitantly followed her. "Do you, know, what, we're looking for?"

"I don't. But you'll recognize it when we get to it. So let's go, in, in, any direction, and just stop sometimes so that I can look in each direction and tell you whether we find anything that way in the future. Then we'll know which way to go."

<bigbreak>

It was a long walk, through a lot of mud. At first, I manifested a swath of fire to boil it away. Yali liked it, but it scared Alchemist. So then I just manifested a bunch of wooden boards to lay down over the mud. That worked for a while, but when it came time to use the Seeing, Yali asked me to stop manifesting to make it easier. So then we had to trudge through a lot of mud again. At least I had my nice boots now.

While we walked, we also filled in Alchemist on everything that had happened since they left.
[????? Summary language: setting off to look for ingredients, and also telling Alchemist about the revelations from last chapter

At last, we came to a spot where Yali saw something in the future. She pointed Alchemist to the general area where they had found something, then let them lead the way.

Alchemist led us to a tiny brook and knelt down next to it. They lowered their hands into the water, kneading the thick clay from the streambed and drawing up handfuls of it into a little sack.

"Solid… But it needs…"

"The clay will stabilize the potion. Without the clay, the energy from the sorcery might be released prematurely or damage other parts of the medium. But the clay isn't receptive to magic by itself. With <em>only</em> the clay, the sorcery wouldn't stay in potion form, it would float away into the air. So we'll also need –"

"Okay, that's nice, but," I said, "Morrow's going to have to drink a bottle of clay??"

"Maybe, if…"

Yali looked into the future. "It can be diluted. Not with water, but with, with, oil."

"How are we gonna get oil?"

"Let me look something up." Yali pulled out her phone.

Suddenly we had to do a lot of research. Yali opened the local encyclopedia on her phone and started looking up ways you could extract oil from plants. To give the rest of us something to do, she also manifested two copies of her phone so both of us could look in the encyclopedia, too.

"Remember, I can see if you look at anything private," she said as put one of the copies into my hand.

"Oh gods, did I do that in the future?"

Yali chuckled. "Don't worry about it."

[????? word variety: don't just say "plants" every time here:]

Not that I was much use. I looked up a bunch of plants, but I didn't find anything about extracting oil. Then I found an article about a giant, enchanted plant that ate people. It was made by a serial killer who was also a sorcerer, and even after he got caught for a different murder, the plant ate a few more unsuspecting people over the next few months before they figured out what was happening. Nobody suspected it because it looked like any other ????? until it grabbed someone and ate them. After they finally dealt with it, they also cut down and replanted all the other ?????plants in the town he was from, just in case.

[????? Eventually, I was interrupted because] Yali found what she was looking for. Of course, the plants we needed didn't seem to be growing anywhere around here. But after a long discussion, Yali and Alchemist agreed that they could use Alchemist's powers to <em>grow</em> the plants they needed. Regular manifesting wouldn't work, but the Broken God could cheat plants out of nowhere. Even then, it was too similar to manifested matter, but if they just started with seedlings and let them grow the rest of the way from the soil, most of the matter would be from the soil, so it would work.

So that's what they did. Alchemist wiggled their fingers into the dirt, coaxing little stems out from the ground. Then they cupped their hands around the new sprouts. Before long, the plants were going absurdly fast, stems and leaves shooting up to be almost as tall as we were, and the ground shifting subtly up and down as the roots spread into the surrounding earth.

Meanwhile, I set to work trying to make a bottle, because the container couldn't be made of manifested matter either. First I tried to make a clay bottle. But shaping the clay into a bottle was a huge pain. <em>Layo</em> could've probably done it, but all I got was a lopsided bowl. Just to see what would happen, I tried to fire the clay by manifesting it to be really hot, but it just cracked into pieces. So I gave up and tried to make a bottle out of wood instead. I cut down a tree and hollowed out a chunk of it with my Blood Blades. The first few times I tried, I accidentally put holes through it, but eventually I got the hang of it. And the Blood Blades were razor-sharp when I needed them to be, so it worked out fairly easily. Pretty soon, I had a whole row of asymmetric wooden jars and bottles in front of me.

While I was doing that, Yali and Alchemist harvested the seeds from their big plants. Once we had the seeds, then we had to press them. Yali found some diagrams of a big metal press for extracting the oil. Of course, we had to build it piece by piece based on the pictures, because none of us had imprinted anything like that. We didn't do a great job of it, and we ended up with bits of seeds mixed into the oil. But it was good enough.

Next up was the ingredient that was "receptive to magic". Once again, Yali looked up a plant with the right magical properties, and Alchemist grew it. This time, it was a sprawling bramble bush, with little, dark reddish berries speckled between its thorns. Alchemist and Yali got to work hunting the brambles for berries that were just the right ripeness. They weren't paying much attention to me. So I idly picked a few of the berries and ate them.

Flavor exploded in my mouth, stabbing wildly down along my jaw and up behind my nostrils. They were the absolute WORST thing I had EVER tasted. I immediately reached for some more.

"Don't eat too many of those, they're poisonous," said Yali casually, not bothering to look back at me.

"Whaaaaat?!"

Yali chuckled. "As long as you only eat a few, your natural manifesting will keep you from getting sick."

"Oooookay," I said, dropping the ones I was holding.

?????

<bigbreak>

Finally, we had everything assembled.

"You'll have to take it from here," said Yali to Alchemist. "I can't See anything after you start making the potion."

Alchemist nodded and closed their mouth. Then they closed their eyes, too. They set one of my wooden jars on the ground in front of them. After a short pause, they dipped one hand into the mixture, then the other hand. With oily clay coating their hands, they reached into the air, their fingers curling like someone playing a harp.

The haze stabbed into my head and heart. Lines of force flickered in the air, spreading out like lightning in slow motion, as if Alchemist was prying open fractures in the universe itself. It was almost painful to look at, but I couldn't look away. The feeling was way beyond the normal buzz of sorcery. Every time the lines flickered, it sent a jarring feeling through me, like it was trying to shake me to pieces. And in between, there was a terrible sense of unease, a doubt that anything I believed had ever been real.

Alchemist stopped.

Yali frantically muttered to me, "They're going to start again! We have to stay back!" She took my arm and hurried me away from where Alchemist was sitting. I couldn't resist glancing back as Alchemist started the process again. But Yali blocked me. "Don't look at it either! Don't pay attention to it!"

"But –"

"That, that, that stuff can take apart a human soul! We don't want our souls to get caught up in it! And if you pay attention to it, that makes you closer to it –"

Even when I looked away, the cracks in the universe were still sizzling in the back of my mind. "How do I 'not pay attention' to <em>that</em>?!"

"I, I, I –" Yali looked around wildly. Then, without warning, she shoved me by the shoulders. I stumbled backwards. 

"Woah, what –"

In moments, Yali had pinned me with my back to a tree. She leaned in and kissed me on the mouth. "I'm distracting you," she said.

"You sure know how to distract me," I laughed, thrills running through me as she planted a series of kisses starting at my ear and moving up the side of my face. I pulled closer to her, grabbing fistfuls of her sweater and diving into clamped my lips onto hers. We pushed back and forth, squishing our bodies onto each other, barely remembering to come up for air.

At some point, I noticed that I didn't feel like the world was being torn apart anymore. And that Alchemist was looking at us.

I peeled myself off of Yali, laughing and straightening my shirt. "Oh, hey there, Alchemist, haha, how did it go?"

Alchemist hesitated, then waved for us to come look. They led us to where they'd been working. The wooden jar sat alone on a mat on the ground, not looking like much. Its lid was closed tight, and I couldn't feel anything from it.

Yali took one look at it. "So it worked? It's stable?"

Alchemist hesitated again, then nodded.

"The Seeing is working again. That's good…" She looked into the future for a while. "I can See up until when Morrow drinks the potion, then it's all blank again."

"Why?" I asked.

"The unravelling potion is supposed to be impossible. It breaks all the rules of the Ravelling. So it's no surprise the Waiting God can't see past it. But that doesn't make things any easier for me…" She sighed. "I guess we should be concerned what'll happen to Morrow after he drinks it. If the Seeking God is all that's keeping him going, then when it's taken away from him… He might pass out, his injuries might be more dangerous to him…"

[????? consider possibly cutting this next bit if it doesn't have great promises]

"What injuries?" I said without thinking. "Oh, right."

"If Rinn is bringing, one potion to him…?" mumbled Alchemist.

"Oh yeah, I could bring a healing potion too –"

"You have a hard time convincing him to drink even one potion!" said Yali.

We launched into yet another argument about what to do. Right when I was in the middle of arguing, Alchemist sprayed me in the face with a spray bottle of water. I was completely flabbergasted.

"Oh… I didn't, mean to, hit you…"

I tried to brush the water out of my face. "Wait, are you thinking, a spray-on healing potion?" I said. "Wait, can we spray on the unravelling potion?!"

"No, that one needs to be completely absorbed," said Yali. "But a healing potion might, might, be able to be more, more superficial."

<bigbreak>

So there we were, trekking through the wilderness to track down Morrow, equipped with spray bottles full of healing potions and the jar with the unravelling potion.

It wasn't hard to follow him. Even a <em>normal</em> person could have spotted all the manifested junk he left behind him. And to Yali, it was even more obvious. We followed him through the woods, the terrain getting rougher and rougher. The further we went, the more downhill it got. Before long, we started having to detour sideways so we didn't end up sliding down the steep, muddy, rocky slopes.

From the look of things, <em>Morrow</em> had slid straight down them.

I squinted across at a short smear of blood on the rocks. "Should there be this much blood?" I said. "I mean, there's not, like, lakes of it, but we've been following him for a while, so it adds up –"

"It's manifesting. His wounds aren't healing because I did them with hostile intent and damaged his soul. But he unconsciously manifests more blood to replace what is lost."

"Oh gods, what if he loses all his original blood and then he gets back to Earth and –"

"That's what the healing potion is for," said Yali bluntly.

"Right…"

We descended to the mouth of a ravine, guarded by a tall, blackened tree with splotches of blood on its trunk. Morrow must have paused to rest here. Or, knowing him, paused because he was physically unable to go on the time. Yali stopped walking and squinted. "Do you feel it, too?" she said.

I stopped alongside her. When I paid attention, I could feel something sloshing at the edges of my mind. "Yeah. I do."

"We're getting close. This is where we stay behind, and you go on alone."

"Right…"

Yali handed me the unravelling potion, letting me carry it in a bag hanging from a short rope. She didn't want it to touch my soulfire directly. "You've got this," she said.

I laughed. It came out louder than I expected. "That's pretty reassuring, coming from someone who can literally see the future."

"Don't get careless."

"Fine. What do I have to look out for?"

"…don't lose your cool if he hurts himself. Just hold onto your soulfire. It's rare, but if you lose it, I have to step in to protect you. Then you're okay, but Morrow is dead for real."

"Well, shit."

"Yeah. You ready?"

"Alright, let's do this thing." I threw my head back and howled into the air, letting off a flare of my soulfire into the air around me. Then I tightened it back into a steady burn, a warm, invulnerable glow from every part of my [????? skin? No, because it comes from the interior]. I grinned. I still couldn't get over how <em>awesome</em> it felt to fill myself with soulfire. "See you both soon!" I declared. Then I hurried onwards.

The ravine was narrow and cut deep into the ground, not leaving much room to walk if you didn't want to step in the little brook that ran along its length. Where there <em>was</em> room, spindly, twisted trees hogged up the shore. But the water wasn't much deeper than my foot. I confidently strode down the middle, splashing it aside. When it soaked my shoes, I just unmanifested them and walked barefoot in the cold stream, my soulfire keeping me warm.

As I got closer, the forest swam around me. It felt like the world was unstable, trying to make me forget which way was up and which way was down. But from inside my soulfire, it didn't seem so threatening. I was a transcendent pillar of flame. I knew exactly where <em>I</em> was. It was just the rest of the world that was having trouble.

I was deep in the ravine when I spotted him. He was stumbling along away from me, his feet dragging through the water. As I watched, he wavered off to the side and had to brace himself against a tree, then stumbled back into the middle of the brook again.

Before I approached him, I stowed the unravelling potion behind a rock. Yali had told me to do that. If I carried it with me, Morrow could break it by accident before he decided to drink it.

"Morrow!" I called out.

Morrow must have heard me, because he tried to turn around. But somehow, he only managed to trip over his own feet and go sprawling into the wall of the ravine. I rushed to help him, but almost as soon as he had gone down, he lunged to his feet again, his grinning, battered face swaying towards me.

Yali had <em>seriously</em> fucked him up. Like, I'd beaten up plenty of assholes myself – and I had gotten beat up plenty of times too – but I had never seen someone messed up <em>this</em> bad. One eye was completely swollen shut, and the other one wasn't looking much better. His nose was sticking off in the wrong direction, dripping a mass of blood right down his chin. His hands were messed up too, fingers sticking off in all the wrong directions.

I immediately wanted to hurt whoever did this to him, but that was Yali. And that wasn't what I was here for. I knew what I had to do. "Morrow! I've got something for you."

Morrow's one working eye wavered back and forth, never quite focusing in on me. There was a horrible grin on his face. The air was thick with his power, pulsing and flickering as he moved. "Who are you!!" he screamed.

"You can't see me? I'm Rinn –"

I didn't get a chance to finish. The power rushed in at me. As soon as I said my name, I could feel it locking on, making me the one focus of the entire world. The trees, the hills, and even Morrow faded into the background. I was the one on stage, and all around me, it was like millions of scrabbling fingers trying to pull at my thoughts, tongues pressing in to get a taste of my essence, mouths trying to suck away my skin and drain out the juice below.

But even the grotesque pressure of his powers was little more than a shadow to my soulfire. I hung on tight, blazing brightly against the vortex, holding the chaos firmly at arms length.

"Too bright!!!" Morrow screamed. "It's burning me, you're burning me –"

"I'm not going to lower my soulfire. [????? I will accommodate you as much as I can,] but this is important to me. And Yali and –"

"Yali!!! You're here to finish me off!! You're going to kill me, you're going to burn me to death –" Even as he screamed and spit blood, he kept on grinning and walking towards me.

"I'm here to help," I said firmly.

Morrow stumbled right into me, his head bumping in the midst of my soulfire, his face smearing blood onto my shirt.

I clasped him by the shoulders. I didn't know if he could feel what I felt, but when his blood touched me, it formed a sacred bond between us. In fact, it had come full circle. When we had first met, I had put some of my blood into him. And now, his blood had landed on me as well. We were linked together now, no less than I was linked with Yali or Alchemist.

"Morrow. I know you're in pain. I want you to listen to me. I'm here to help." In the warmth of my soulfire, it was all so simple. The things to say were so obvious.

"Pain? Pain where?? ?????

[????? morrow sticking to saying unrelated stuff]

The old me would have been frustrated. I would have said something like <em>you literally just manifested with your own blood, how can you not realize you're bleeding?!</em>. But now, it all seemed so much clearer. I could see Morrow's desires laid out in front of me. He was a tiny, ?????adjective flame trying to carve out a hole in a huge cloud of fear. And he was also the cloud, trying to drive the flame away from danger and pain. And he was also the pain, trying to scream out to be heard. He was reaching out for… comfort? No, for… safety? No, not even that. [????? He wasn't able to believe in safety.] ????? clinging onto anything that made him feel like he was in control.

[????? Rinn says something reassuring]

[????? Morrow ignores it and pulls Rinn further along, "it's just up ahead!"]

I was pretty sure there wasn't anything up ahead. But [????? I chose to play along, with a reason]

As we walked along together, I watched how he was moving. He jerked along, alternately flinching in pain and lunging forward to compensate. This pain was going to be a problem. As long as the literal, physical pain was overwhelming him, there was no way I could expect him to step back and think about what I had to say. [????? But how could I get him to accept help with the pain if he wasn't listening in the first place]

I held up one of my spray bottles. "Morrow, I've got a healing potion in this bottle. It can heal your wounds, all I have to do is –"

Suddenly, Morrow was listening intently. "A potion! Raylie! You've been with Raylie! Raylie!!!!" Morrow leaned away from me, and I felt a surge of his powers again.

I grabbed onto his head, letting soulfire flow from my hands to stop whatever he was doing. "This is no time for you to reach out for Raylie!" I said firmly. "You hurt them before. If you want to get back your loving relationship with them, you have to understand what you're doing. Otherwise you're just going to hurt them <em>again</em>." I didn't feel like my words were getting through to him. I really needed to do something about the pain. "I'd like to give you this healing potion. All I have to do is spray it on to you. It'll make the pain go away. Is that okay with you?"

"Raylie… Raylie…" he moaned.

I wasn't going to get a direct answer. I wanted to just go ahead and spray him, but I had to be careful. If I made him feel like I was taking away his control, he might cling onto his problems even harder. I had to approach this differently. [????? Something like "I'm going to do it, tell me if there is any reason I shouldn't" – think about what's the best things to acknowledge for consent/etc. reasons]

?????

I sprayed.

[????? Physical description – maybe "the cloudy potion dripped down his face, [making the wounds go away]"/the bruises un-swelled, etc.. Morrow convulsed and went limp, sprawling on the ground]

?????


Morrow ran to where I pointed. As soon as he spotted where the potion was sitting, he dove and snatched it up. He plowed into the ground, then clumsily rolled into a sitting position. Then he wrenched off the top of the jar and slammed it onto his face.

For a moment, I was thrown into a panic, thinking he might spill the potion. But it all flowed into his mouth, almost of its own accord. His eyes bugged out as he frantically took four giant gulps. And then it was done. He chucked the empty jar on the ground and looked up at me.

I looked back at him.

"What comes next?! Is it gonna –"

Morrow jerked forward, like he was choking. Some… <em>thing</em> started spilling out of his mouth. It was like the magic from the portals – I couldn't see it physically, but it was dazzling. ?????

Moments later, it was gone. [????? Morrow's powers were gone, too, leaving just the woods and the quiet sound of the water moving around us]

Morrow looked up at me again, ?????. "Rinn! You're back!" He looked around, as if he was saying everything for the first time. "Nice woods! Just think of all the things we can –"

He slumped forward and fell motionless.

<bigbreak>

I prodded Morrow with my foot.

At least he was still breathing. He didn't look like he was in good shape though. His neck was limp, his mouth was hanging open, and he was kind of drooling on himself.

At this point, he'd been lying still for long enough that there probably weren't going to be any more surprises. I lowered my soulfire. That was kind of a relief. Soulfire felt totally amazing, but after feeling totally amazing for a long time in a row, sometimes it felt better to just relax.

Now what? We hadn't really talked about what to do <em>after</em> he drank the potion, other than making sure he didn't die. I decided I should probably take him back to the others.

I knelt down and slung him over my shoulders. Carrying him was almost effortless. At first I thought it was because of how skinny he was, but he probably weighed more than me anyway because he was a bunch taller. No, it wasn't about <em>him</em>. It was the Blood God's strength that was helping me.

The walk back out of the ravine was uneventful. With Morrow's powers gone, it seemed like maybe things could be calm again. At least for now. For now, I just had to make sure not to drop him.

When I got back to Yali and Alchemist, they were already standing to greet me. Yali looked way different than she had when I left. ?????. And she had a new broad belt with loads of potions hanging from it. ????

"What's up with all the gear?" I called out.

"Preparations for when we confront Justicar," she said firmly.

"Oh yeah, that's a good point."

When I got close, Alchemist hurried to check on Morrow. It was pretty awkward with me still carrying him over my shoulder. "Oy, let me put him down first!" I said. I shoved Alchemist back a bit, manifested a mattress and slung Morrow down onto it.

As Alchemist crouched over him to check his vital signs, Yali looked down at Morrow contemptfully. She frowned. "I don't believe there is any risk that I will attack him again," she said, "but things will be much easier if he is kept a good distance away from me after he wakes up."

[????? Is this the right place for Rinn to complain about Yali hating Morrow more than Justicar? Or should this go in the final chapter?]

"Seriously, though, what's up with you hating Morrow more than Justicar? I mean, when you talk about Justicar, it's always '?????' and 'we must be prepared to confront her', but with Morrow it's 'maybe he SHOULD be killed!' and 'so I'm probably not going to murder him, like, RELUCTANTLY' – I mean, I get that what Morrow did was bad, but Justicar almost KILLED me! Her sword was literally in my chest!"

[????? rephrase this to account for Yali knowing in advance] "<em>Forty-five minutes,</em>" said Yali angrily. "That's how long it took me, running as hard as I could, to get to you before Morrow did too much damage. I know because I checked my phone while I ran to make sure I was pacing myself the right amount. Justicar took me by surprise! I didn't have time to be upset. But I had to watch for forty-five minutes while Morrow abused you. Forty-five minutes of cursing myself for not getting an extra Severing Step from Alchemist when I had the chance. And I'm not like you. I can't be angry at someone and then forgive them with my next breath. It doesn't matter what I believe now. I will hate the face of Morrow for as long as I live."

"Woah, that's… I mean, shit."

"I'm not done. There is another reason. Morrow has always been like the ?????s. Temperamental, clinging to obsessions to cover up his pain. But –"

"Hey, <em>I'm</em> temperamental. Morrow's kind of a mess, but –"

"For my <em>entire life</em> I have had to clean up other people's messes! ????? But Justicar… Justicar is like <em>me</em>."

"Are you kidding me," I said.

????? Both of us will sacrifice anything to achieve our goals. Both of us will destroy anyone we have to. The only difference is that Justicar will stop at the gods, and I will not."

????? "The Stern doesn't have to be about sacrificing what you care about just to be obedient to someone else. It can also be about sacrificing… unimportant things… to get what you truly want."

"Unimportant things like ever being happy?!" I snapped.

"That's not what I meant!" Yali snapped back. "Being happy is very important to me! I will definitely make sure it happens! Besides, I <em>am</em> happy with you –"

I had kind of said it on instinct, based on my arguments with Justicar earlier. But if Yali was going to respond like <em>that</em>… "Listen to yourself! Is that what someone who was happy would say?"

"– I'm talking about little things. Like when I don't want to get up in the morning, but I get up anyway because I know I can't see you if I don't get up. Or when I'm having pain and I don't want to [????? do something that's hard work], but I do it anyway because I know ?????. That's Stern."

"You shouldn't have to do that! You shouldn't have to work hard <em>when you're already in pain!</em>"

Emotionlessly, Yali replied, "I <em>shouldn't</em> have to. But I <em>do</em> have to. And if I didn't have the Stern to help make myself do it, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't get up in the morning."

"[????? You shouldn't have to,] that's not what life is supposed to be about –"

"Maybe your life is easier than mine," she said coldly.

[????? I think Rinn goes to "I need to comfort Yali" instead of feeling hurt, hugs her, and notices that Yali is shaking from being upset, even though she doesn't show it in her face. Maybe: [Yali, coldly] "I was trying to open up to you." [Rinn feels bad] "It's okay. There will be another time."]

?????

A few hours later, Alchemist wandered back to us, leaving Morrow out ahead.

Dry leaves blew past on a chilly wind, clearing the dust and fog from the air. Our boots were covered in mud from walking over slimy ground. ?????

"I don't know what to do," said Alchemist despondently. "I don't know what to say… He's…" They gestured vaguely in the air. Floating leaves formed into a picture of Morrow, sprawled out and twisted into several pieces. I knew instantly what it meant.

"Have fun with that," muttered Yali.

"I'll go talk to him," I said tiredly.

Beside me, Yali stiffened.

"Look, he can't hurt me again even if he wanted to. He was helpless to my soulfire even when he <em>had</em> his powers. Now he's just, like, some loser."

"Fine. Go. Just don't make me think about it."

?????

Morrow half-startled. After a moment, he looked back at me. "Oh. It's you."

Something <em>instantly</em> seemed off about him. His reaction was way slower than usual, and his words came out slower, too. He seemed… glum? At first I thought that was super weird. I'd seen him ripping himself apart, but I'd never seen him just regular sad, or any sort of less-energetic mood at all. Then I thought, <em>of course</em>! He didn't have the Seeking God inside him anymore. It had probably been the Seeking God that was keeping him going the whole time. And now…

"How are you, uh, feeling?" I said.

[????? somewhere: how Alchemist is the only one who hasn't hurt anybody, and how both the blood and waiting will trample over the broken to get what they want]



[????? Should I use the unraveling potion?; where in this chapter? probably near the end?]

"That <em>is</em> what I would have told you to do, as recently as the third layer…" said Yali. "But now… I am starting to think that the Blood God <em>should</em> rejuvenate."

"But…" I said. Even after all the revelations we'd just found out, that was still ?????. "I mean, I don't want to say Justicar was right, but, what if Justicar was right? Even though I was [????? justified] – I mean, even though the Blood God was [????? justified in trying to get revenge], it's still been lashing out all over the place." Even as I said it, though, I started to doubt it myself. When I really thought about it, the Blood God <em>hadn't</em> been lashing out at anyone except Yali. If anything, I'd had <em>more</em> empathy for everyone else. It had even marked Justicar as "not my real enemy". <em>Justicar!</em>

Yali spoke gravely. "The Blood God is a god of anger, and it has been starving for the last seventy years. So, are people less angry now? No, of course not. Anger has always been a part of, of, of humanity, of humans. The only difference is that now, their anger isn't being <em>overseen</em>. They don't have a god to… to bring meaning to their anger, to guide it to a better purpose." ????? "Besides… even if we did want to, we still shouldn't do it <em>yet</em>. Your soulfire is one of the only powers that can pierce Justicar's armor."

"I'll have to kill her…" I said. I swallowed. "?????!"

"It may be necessary," said Yali gravely.

"Fuck!" I yelled. "That's – I mean, you know I'm all about beating the bad guys, but actually <em>killing</em> someone? That's – that's – If you kill someone, they're <em>dead</em>! <em>Dead</em> dead! Please don't tell me that's the only way – wait, you said '<em>may</em> be necessary' – you think we can get away without a fight?"

"The final portal won't open until the conflict is resolved. But there are other possibilities. She doesn't have to <em>die</em> if she can be persuaded to [????? take the unravelling potion herself? or just back down?] –"

"– like that's gonna happen –"

"– and it doesn't have to be <em>you</em> who bears the burden. Alchemi–"

"No FUCKING way!!! We are NOT making ALCHEMIST fight our –"

"–st would be capable of <em>creating</em> a weapon that <em>I</em> could use to –"

"Still no! I'll just do it myself, we are <em>not</em> getting Alchemist involved in this! They are SOFT and SWEET and – gods, Yali, how could you even <em>think</em> of such a thing?!"

Yali shouted back, "Me thinking of things that hurt people is why you're still alive right now!"

"Yeah, but not like <em>this</em> –"

"Yes, like this! <em>Exactly</em> like this! When I saw Justicar draw her sword on you, my first thought was, 'what powers do I need so I can get there and save you?' And my second thought was '<em>how loud do I have to yell at Alchemist so they'll be scared enough to hurry up and do what I say, but not scared enough to mess it up?</em>' If I had wasted time thinking about how to be <em>nice</em> to them, you would be <em>dead</em> right now! If I hadn't forced them to try and make a weapon back then, I wouldn't have had anything to bluff her with! So don't <em>ever</em> tell me not to think about something because it's too cruel! For my entire life, I have had to be the one who sees what has to be done, when everyone else can only see what's right in front of them! I have <em>always</em> been the one who does what has to be done, when no one else will!"

I had wanted to argue back, but against the thunder of her words, I didn't feel like I could say anything at all. It was the first time she had ever aimed the full force of her anger and judgment directly towards me. It wasn't like I couldn't handle it, but… shit. I could finally understand how she was the same person who had bullied another kid into a nervous wreck. And at the same time, that terrifying power, lurking right under the surface… It was part of why I'd always loved her, why I couldn't get enough of her.

And the worst part was, she wasn't wrong.

"Well… fuck," I said. "I, uh, I didn't mean to [????? criticize you]. I mean, I guess I did, but, uh… fuck. I'm sorry. I'm just… Alchemist doesn't deserve this."

Yali looked away. "We all trample over the Broken to get what we want." It was an old saying.

"It shouldn't have to be that way," I said.

Yali didn't answer. Instead, she looked out at the world around us. I followed her gaze. There was the [????? callback to some effect Morrow had on the world]. Further in the distance, I could still make out the black cloud, slowly dispersing, that had risen when the trees charred from my scream. ?????

[????? Is alchemist the only one who didn't hurt anybody?]

"Justicar stabbed me. Morrow did… that thing, to me and Alchemist. <em>I</em> stabbed <em>you</em>…"

"And I beat up Morrow."

"Right. But Alchemist… Alchemist didn't do anything."

"There's still time…" muttered Yali.

"What? Time for Alchemist to hurt somebody? That doesn't – wait… was that, like, a <em>joke</em>?"

"I, I, I, think so? I don't know. I can't stand this world."

[????? They sit(?) in silence for a while. Rinn follows the train of thought back to "alchemist making a weapon"]

"So, uh… I get what you're saying. Sometimes you have to do things that… aren't good… because you have to. And it doesn't make it <em>right</em>, but… uh… ugh, you know what I mean. But <em>this</em> time, in <em>this</em> situation…" I swallowed. "We really don't have to force Alchemist to make a weapon again. We're not in a rush like that time. And I have my soulfire. I can do it. Waiting knows I'm the one who deserves to." I laughed hollowly. "I guess I shouldn't be saying 'Waiting knows' anymore, should I…"

"It's okay. I understand."

"Just, be nice to Alchemist, okay?"

"I'll try." Yali sounded regretful. "I, I, wasn't going to make them do it. It was just… a possibility. It wasn't the possibility we were going to <em>choose</em>. I have a feeling it was always going to be about just you and me, in the end."

"Yeah."

I held her hand. ?????

?????

[????? We made a lot of plans for what we were going to do in the next layer]

?????

[????? "Is there anything else we need to discuss before we go to the next world"]

Yali squeezed my hand. "Pretty soon, we'll want to to meet up with the others and go through the portal. If there's anything we still need to talk about…"

"I… you know what, I actually feel like we've got things figured out! I mean, I'll probably think of something else in like two minutes, but, you know. I think I'm good. What about you?"

"I…" She looked away, then back again. "We still haven't talked about… When I made you do the Controlling Game. When –"

"Oh gods, don't remind me," I said.

"Remember, I, I promised I'd check in with you, to make sure –"

"Uh, yeah, you were totally fine. I was being a huge asshole to Alchemist, I'm glad you stopped me."

"I'm glad to hear you say that," she said heavily.

And just like that, everything was settled.

[????? We met up with the others and left through the portal, with some physical description, and affection between the romantic pairs]
