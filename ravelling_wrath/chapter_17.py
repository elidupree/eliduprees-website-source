"I've, been, thinking, and…"

Alchemist clearly had a lot weighing on them. [????? Physical description; both of us waited for them to continue]

"I know, what, you said. Morrow… his powers… we can't get near him without his powers, hurting us. But, what if…"

Alchemist swallowed.

"What if, he, didn't, <em>have</em>, his, powers?"

"But how?" I reacted.

"<em>The Broken God!</em> You, Yali, said, my, alchem –, my, powers, are, <em>parts of the Broken God stored in a physical medium</em>. And the god can do it! That's what I realized! It <em>ravels</em> into me, and then it <em>unravels</em> out of me! There's part of it that does the unravelling!"

I was about to say something, but Yali's hand squeezed my shoulder. I clamped my mouth shut and kept listening.

"So, if, maybe, the unravelling goes into a potion? And the potion goes into Morrow?"

"Is that <em>possible?</em>" I said. "I thought the Ravelling was, like, a special rule that even the gods have to follow! Like, the Blood God wouldn't even need to kill anyone if it could just 'unravel' the Farseer – one god shouldn't be able to remove a <em>different</em> god's threads –"

"If any god can do it, it's the Broken God," said Yali. "<em>When all plans fail and all ?????, the Broken God sees a way forward,</em>" she intoned.

"Is that a Broken saying?" I asked.

"Actually, it's a Waiting saying."

"Oh duh, it refers to plans, haha."

?????

"[????? Should I use the unraveling potion?]"

"That <em>is</em> what I would have told you to do, as recently as the third layer…" said Yali. "But now… I am starting to think that the Blood God <em>should</em> rejuvenate."

"But…" I said. Even after all the revelations we'd just found out, that was still ?????. "I mean, I don't want to say Justicar was right, but, what if Justicar was right? Even though I was [????? justified] – I mean, even though the Blood God was [????? justified in trying to get revenge], it's still been lashing out all over the place." Even as I said it, though, I started to doubt it myself. When I really thought about it, the Blood God <em>hadn't</em> been lashing out at anyone except Yali. If anything, I'd had <em>more</em> empathy for everyone else. It had even marked Justicar as "not my real enemy". <em>Justicar!</em>

Yali spoke gravely. "The Blood God is a god of anger, and it has been starving for the last 70 years. So, are people less angry now? No, of course not. Anger has always been a part of, of, of humanity, of humans. The only difference is that now, their anger isn't being <em>overseen</em>. They don't have a god to… to bring meaning to their anger, to guide it to a better purpose."

[????? Rinn returning with Morrow]

I saw Yali and Alchemist already standing to greet me. Yali looked way different than she had when I left. ?????. And she had a new broad belt with loads of potions hanging from it. ????

"What's up with all the gear?" I called out.

"Preparations for when we confront Justicar," she said firmly.

"Oh yeah, that's a good point."

When I got close, Alchemist hurried to check on Morrow. It was pretty awkward with me still carrying him over my shoulder. "Oy, let me put him down first!" I said. I shoved Alchemist back a bit, manifested a mattress and slung Morrow down onto it.

As Alchemist crouched over him to check his vital signs, Yali looked down at Morrow contemptfully. She frowned. "I don't believe there is any risk that I will attack him again," she said, "but things will be much easier if he is kept a good distance away from me after he wakes up."

[????? Is this the right place for Rinn to complain about Yali hating Morrow more than Justicar?]

?????

[Alchemist comes back from talking to Morrow and relates feeling bad about how Morrow feels]

"I'll go talk to him," I said.

Yali stiffened.

"Look, he can't hurt me again even if he wanted to. He was helpless to my soulfire even when he <em>had</em> his powers. Now he's just, like, some loser."

"Fine. Go. Just don't make me think about it."
