"I've, been, thinking, and…"

Alchemist clearly had a lot weighing on them. [????? Physical description; both of us waited for them to continue]

"I know, what, you said. Morrow… his powers… we can't get near him without his powers, hurting us. But, what if…"

Alchemist swallowed.

"What if, he, didn't, <em>have</em>, his, powers?"

"But how?" I reacted.

"<em>The Broken God!</em> You, Yali, said, my, alchem –, my, powers, are, <em>parts of the Broken God stored in a physical medium</em>. And the god can do it! That's what I realized! It <em>ravels</em> into me, and then it <em>unravels</em> out of me! There's part of it that does the unravelling!"

I was about to say something, but Yali's hand squeezed my shoulder. I clamped my mouth shut and kept listening.

"So, if, maybe, the unravelling goes into a potion? And the potion goes into Morrow?"

"Is that <em>possible?</em>" I said. "I thought the Ravelling was, like, a special rule that even the gods have to follow! Like, the Blood God wouldn't even need to kill anyone if it could just 'unravel' the Farseer – one god shouldn't be able to remove a <em>different</em> god's threads –"

"If any god can do it, it's the Broken God," said Yali. "<em>When all plans fail and all ?????, the Broken God sees a way forward,</em>" she intoned.

"Is that a Broken saying?" I asked.

"Actually, it's a Waiting saying."

"Oh duh, it refers to plans, haha."

?????

"But… it needs…" Alchemist manifested a flask of water in their hand. "This… isn't, enough, it, needs…"

"A stronger medium," finished Yali. "Materials that are capable of holding such a powerful sorcery."

"Oh… you, maybe, understand it, better…"

"No. You're the one who told that to me. In the future. You explained a lot. You understand more than you know. You just have trouble putting it into words. So, if you'd like, I can fetch the words for you. Your own words, from the future."

"I, maybe, yes? I would, like that?"

The next bit of conversation was… certainly <em>interesting</em>. Alchemist kept saying something vague or even just waving aimlessly, and every time, Yali filled in a clear, detailed description. [????? Details of the potion making needs]

?????

"Do, you, know, what we're looking for?"

"I don't. But you'll recognize it when we get to it. So let's go in, in, any direction, and just stop sometimes so that I can look in each direction and tell you whether we find anything that way in the future. Then we'll know which way to go."

<bigbreak>

?????

Alchemist took us to a tiny brook and gathered clay from the ?????.

"Solid… But it needs…"

"The clay will stabilize the potion. Without the clay, the energy from the sorcery might be released prematurely or damage other parts of the medium. But the clay isn't receptive to magic by itself. With <em>only</em> the clay, the sorcery wouldn't stay in potion form, it would float away into the air."

"Okay, that's nice, but," I said, "Morrow's going to have to drink a bottle of clay??"



?????

Alchemist and Yali got to work hunting the brambles for berries that were just the right ripeness. They weren't paying much attention to me. So I idly picked a few berries and ate them.

Flavor exploded in my mouth, ?????. They were the absolute WORST thing I had EVER tasted. I immediately reached for some more.

"Don't eat too many of those, they're poisonous," said Yali casually, not bothering to look back at me.

"Whaaaaat?!"


[????? somewhere: how Alchemist is the only one who hasn't hurt anybody, and how both the blood and waiting will trample over the broken to get what they want]



[????? Should I use the unraveling potion?; where in this chapter? probably near the end?]

"That <em>is</em> what I would have told you to do, as recently as the third layer…" said Yali. "But now… I am starting to think that the Blood God <em>should</em> rejuvenate."

"But…" I said. Even after all the revelations we'd just found out, that was still ?????. "I mean, I don't want to say Justicar was right, but, what if Justicar was right? Even though I was [????? justified] – I mean, even though the Blood God was [????? justified in trying to get revenge], it's still been lashing out all over the place." Even as I said it, though, I started to doubt it myself. When I really thought about it, the Blood God <em>hadn't</em> been lashing out at anyone except Yali. If anything, I'd had <em>more</em> empathy for everyone else. It had even marked Justicar as "not my real enemy". <em>Justicar!</em>

Yali spoke gravely. "The Blood God is a god of anger, and it has been starving for the last 70 years. So, are people less angry now? No, of course not. Anger has always been a part of, of, of humanity, of humans. The only difference is that now, their anger isn't being <em>overseen</em>. They don't have a god to… to bring meaning to their anger, to guide it to a better purpose." ????? "Besides… your soulfire is one of the only powers that can pierce Justicar's armor."

"I'll have to kill her…" I said. I swallowed. "?????!"

"It may be necessary," said Yali gravely.

[?????"Well, fuck." I looked down at my hands. wait no, more aggressive: "Fuck!" I yelled. "[I fight people a lot but I never wanted to actually kill anyone]!"] "<em>May</em> be, though? You think we can get away without a fight?"

"The final portal won't open until the conflict is resolved. But there are other possibilities. She doesn't have to <em>die</em> if she can be persuaded to take the unravelling potion –"

"– like that's gonna happen –"

"– or tricked, or forced into taking it. And it doesn't have to be <em>you</em> who bears the burden. Alchemi–"

"No FUCKING way!!! We are NOT making ALCHEMIST fight our –"

"–st would be capable of <em>creating</em> a weapon that <em>I</em> could use to –"

"Still no! I'll just do it myself, we are <em>not</em> getting Alchemist involved in this! They are SOFT and SWEET and – gods, Yali, how could you even <em>think</em> of such a thing?!"

Yali shouted back, "Me thinking of things that hurt people is why you're still alive right now!"

"Yeah, but not like <em>this</em> –"

"Yes, like this! <em>Exactly</em> like this! When I saw Justicar draw her sword on you, my first thought was, 'what powers do I need so I can get there and save you?' And my second thought was '<em>how loud do I have to yell at Alchemist so they'll be scared enough to hurry up and do what I say, but not scared enough to mess it up?</em>' If I had wasted time thinking about how to be <em>nice</em> to them, you would be <em>dead</em> right now! If I hadn't forced them to try and make a weapon back then, I wouldn't have had anything to bluff her with! So don't <em>ever</em> tell me not to think about something because it's too cruel! I have <em>always</em> been the one who does what has to be done, when no one else will!"

I had wanted to argue back, but against the thunder of her words, I didn't feel like I could say anything at all. It was the first time she had ever aimed the full force of her anger and judgment directly towards me. It wasn't like I couldn't handle it, but… shit. I could finally understand how she was the same person who had bullied another kid into a nervous wreck. And at the same time, that terrifying power, lurking right under the surface… It was part of why I'd always loved her, why I couldn't get enough of her.

And the worst part was, she wasn't wrong.

"Well… fuck," I said. "

?????

"But, we don't have to force Alchemist to make a weapon this time. We have time. And I have my soulfire. I can do it. Waiting knows I'm the one who deserves to." I laughed hollowly. "I guess I shouldn't be using that saying anymore, should I…"

"It's okay. I understand."






?????

The forest swam around me.

[????? Rinn returning with Morrow]

I saw Yali and Alchemist already standing to greet me. Yali looked way different than she had when I left. ?????. And she had a new broad belt with loads of potions hanging from it. ????

"What's up with all the gear?" I called out.

"Preparations for when we confront Justicar," she said firmly.

"Oh yeah, that's a good point."

When I got close, Alchemist hurried to check on Morrow. It was pretty awkward with me still carrying him over my shoulder. "Oy, let me put him down first!" I said. I shoved Alchemist back a bit, manifested a mattress and slung Morrow down onto it.

As Alchemist crouched over him to check his vital signs, Yali looked down at Morrow contemptfully. She frowned. "I don't believe there is any risk that I will attack him again," she said, "but things will be much easier if he is kept a good distance away from me after he wakes up."

[????? Is this the right place for Rinn to complain about Yali hating Morrow more than Justicar? Or should this go in the final chapter?]

"Seriously, though, what's up with you hating Morrow more than Justicar? I mean, when you talk about Justicar, it's always '?????' and 'we must be prepared to confront her', but with Morrow it's 'maybe he SHOULD be killed!' and 'so I'm probably not going to murder him, like, RELUCTANTLY' – I mean, I get that what Morrow did was bad, but Justicar almost KILLED me! Her sword was literally in my chest!"

"<em>Forty-five minutes,</em>" said Yali angrily. "That's how long it took me, running as hard as I could, to get to you before Morrow did too much damage. I know because I checked my phone while I ran to make sure I was pacing myself the right amount. Justicar took me by surprise! I didn't have time to be upset. But I had to watch for forty-five minutes while Morrow abused you. Forty-five minutes of cursing myself for not getting an extra Severing Step from Alchemist when I had the chance. And I'm not like you. I can't be angry at someone and then forgive them with my next breath. It doesn't matter what I believe now. I will hate the face of Morrow for as long as I live."

"Woah, that's… I mean, shit."

"I'm not done. There is another reason. Morrow has always been like the ?????s. Temperamental, clinging to obsessions to cover up his pain. But –"

"Hey, <em>I'm</em> temperamental. Morrow's kind of a mess, but –"

"For my <em>entire life</em> I have had to clean up other people's messes! ????? But Justicar… Justicar is like <em>me</em>."

"Are you kidding me," I said.

????? Both of us will sacrifice anything to achieve our goals. Both of us will destroy anyone we have to. The only difference is that Justicar will stop at the gods, and I will not."

????? The Stern doesn't have to be about sacrificing what you care about just to be obedient to someone else. It can also be about sacrificing… unimportant things… to get what you truly want.



?????

A few hours later, Alchemist wandered back to us, leaving Morrow out ahead.

Dry leaves blew past on a chilly wind, clearing the dust and fog from the air. Our boots were covered in mud from walking over slimy ground. ?????

"I don't know what to do," said Alchemist despondently. "I don't know what to say… He's…" They gestured vaguely in the air. Floating leaves formed into a picture of Morrow, sprawled out and twisted into several pieces. I knew instantly what it meant.

"Have fun with that," muttered Yali.

"I'll go talk to him," I said tiredly.

Beside me, Yali stiffened.

"Look, he can't hurt me again even if he wanted to. He was helpless to my soulfire even when he <em>had</em> his powers. Now he's just, like, some loser."

"Fine. Go. Just don't make me think about it."

?????

Morrow half-startled. After a moment, he looked back at me. "Oh. It's you."

Something <em>instantly</em> seemed off about him. His reaction was way slower than usual, and his words came out slower, too. He seemed… glum? At first I thought that was super weird. I'd seen him ripping himself apart, but I'd never seen him just regular sad, or any sort of less-energetic mood at all. Then I thought, <em>of course</em>! He didn't have the Seeking God inside him anymore. It had probably been the Seeking God that was keeping him going the whole time. And now…

"How are you, uh, feeling?" I said.
