Now that I got a closer look at her, the Justicar wasn't <em>that</em> tall. She had only looked that way because she had been standing above me. Of course, pretty much everyone looks tall to <em>me</em>, but really, she was only about Yali's height.

Still, she had a commanding presence. She wore her armor effortlessly, like she'd been born with it. And there was an actual <em>sword</em> resting at her side, long and straight. She could probably slice you to bits as soon as she looked at you. It would actually be pretty sexy, if she wasn't, you know, twice my age and also representing the Stern God.

And now she was asking us who was the Blood Child and who was the Farseer.

Yali answered. "She's Rinn. I'm Yali." She held out her hand, offering to shake hands. "We'll have time to talk about our roles later, but for now, –"

"I see," said the Justicar. "You are the Farseer."

Even though Yali wanted me to stay quiet, I couldn't resist. "How the f– Er, how did you know?"

The Justicar smiled grimly. "Her first words were to speak of the future. And now you have confirmed it, as <em>your</em> first words were spoken impulsively." She stepped towards me, her hand resting ominously on the hilt of her sword.

Yali stood in her way.

The Justicar's eyes narrowed. "Farseer, why do you stand with your back to the Blood Child? Do you not know the danger she poses?"

Yali spoke again, matching the Justicar's severe tone. "Rinn is no ordinary Blood Child. She will not harm me."

<em>Well, hopefully,</em> I thought.

"I do not understand," said the Justicar, not yielding a millimeter.

"Then I will explain. Through your connection with the Stern God, you have received the knowledge that the Blood God would endanger me. But the Blood God's will is very different from <em>Rinn's</em> will. She has no intention of acting on the Blood God's violence."

The Justicar's face flickered with doubt. "A nonviolent Blood Child…" she mused. Well, I wouldn't exactly call myself <em>nonviolent</em>, but I wasn't going to mention that in front of <em>her</em>. "But she still represents the rejuvenation of the Blood God. If it regains its strength…"

"Then it will rejuvenate from <em>Rinn's</em> soul. It will be influenced by her, just as much as it tries to influence others," said Yali. The Justicar hesitated. "I know it may be hard to understand, but you will understand in time. For now, I ask that you support me in handling the Blood Child how I have chosen." Yali held out her hand again.

After only a moment more in doubt, the Justicar straightened up, proud and professional again. "Very well," she said. She shook Yali's hand without wavering. Then she turned to me. Yali stepped aside to let her approach.

"Blood Child, do you swear that you will not harm the Farseer?"

I couldn't stand having some intimidating stranger demand that I swear to stuff, but I was supposed to make a good impression on her. And it wasn't like that was something I'd have a hard time swearing to. I put on my most solemn voice. It probably didn't sound completely sincere because I never did that kind of thing, but I was doing my best. "I swear before all the gods that I will not harm Yali," I said. I opened my hands to show that I wasn't planning to hurt anyone, and added, "Look, I love her. There's no way I could hurt her, it would tear me apart."

"Very well." The Justicar held out her hand. I shook it.

"So, uh, I'm Rinn. What's your name?"

"I –" The Justicar shook her head slightly, as if she was trying to shake off some unpleasant thought. "My human name doesn't matter here. Call me Justicar."

?????

[Suddenly,] Yali jerked out of her [Seeing]. "Something's coming!!" she shouted.

I jumped up, every part of me snapping to alert. "What's coming? Where?"

"A, a – a human!" Yali pointed wildly towards the sky. "Very fast, going to crash!"

"A human from the sky?" I confusedly looked where she was pointing, but didn't see anything. But Justicar was already in action. She raised her arms in front of her, in a powerful stance. All around us, a steel dome began to form, with a rigid network of supporting bars making it look almost impossible to break. Where in the Endless did she learn to manifest like that?! I couldn't make anything half as big, and she did it without even touching the stuff she was creating.

My heart was pounding. I hardly knew what was happening – but there was one thing I knew for sure. "Hey, stop that!" I yelled. "Whoever's coming is gonna smash into this! You'll get them killed!" Justicar barely noticed me, so I jammed a Blood Blade into the structure of the partially-formed dome, disrupting how she was building it.

"What do you propose?" she said sharply. All her muscles were tensed up as she concentrated on keeping the dome intact.

"I don't know, what about catching them in a big net? Or, like, a trampoline –"

"Do it then – we don't have much time!" Justicar dropped her hands to her sides, allowing the dome to fall to pieces and vanish. Frantically, I filled the space by manifesting a big trampoline.

"They'll bottom out on that!"

"I fucking know that! We'll put it up at an angle so it catches them in midair –" I followed where Yali was pointing, and heaved the trampoline up at an angle, barely keeping it steady with my arms. "Now support this with some of your metal bars!"

"Fine!" Justicar raised her arms again, and more metal beams snapped into place, holding up half the trampoline. "Move over, you're in the way of the other side –"

"I'll do this side –" I manifested the first thing I could think of – more Blood Blades, but this time, distorted into long poles that flowed and merged with the trampoline on one end and the floor of our star on the other.

"That's a weak structure, you need to reinforce it with –" Justicar stepped towards me, arms held out to add to my work –

"GET DOWN!!!" yelled Yali. She grabbed my arm and threw me with her full weight, sending me tumbling off towards the edge of the star. And then everything exploded.

In an instant, an overwhelming pain had smashed through limbs I didn't know I'd had. And then after the first shock, there was a burning so strong it brought tears to my eyes. But I had my own fire inside of me, and I wouldn't be beaten so easily. Biting back the pain, I forced myself to climb to my feet and look back at the wreckage.

The sounds echoed into my mind. The loud snap of the Blood Blades shattering and the trampoline tearing apart. The crash of collapsing metal. And the thud and crack as a human body smashed onto the surface of the star.

He lay sprawled on the floor, a mass of blood with one arm torn open and one leg twisted at a horrible angle under him. Massive burn marks covered his clothing and half his chest. My heart caught in my throat as I struggled towards him. For an awful moment I was sure he was dead.

Then he opened his mouth and screamed, a deafening scream that pounded at my eardrums ?????.

Justicar didn't delay an instant. She was already standing over him. In a flash, heavy bindings tightened around the bleeding arm. The next moment, more steel slammed into existence around all his arms and legs, locking him in place and yanking the broken leg back around to ?????.

"Manifest it back together!" Justicar yelled at him. "Manifest your leg back together before the damage gets worse!"

He didn't hear her. His eyes stared wildly into the distance, oblivious to everything around him. He screamed again, jerking and struggling against the bars, his voice getting ragged.

"Stop struggling! You're only making it worse!" Justicar made more steel bands around his elbows and forehead, constraining his movement even further.

"What the fuck, Justicar, you think he can hear you like that??" I was only a few steps away. I stubbornly forced one foot in front of the other. If only I could get to him in time –

"What do you propose?!"

"Let me help him!"

"What are you going to do??"

"I don't know!!!"

"That's not good enough! I can't let you complicate things when he's in critical cond–" Justicar stepped towards me to block me from getting closer, but she was too late. I fell forward on to my knees, ducking under her arm, and slumped forward far enough to put my hand on the injured person's chest. Desperately, I tried to wish for anything that could help. I imagined pushing warm, healing energy into him, as if I could manifest him back to health. <em>Please just survive,</em>, I prayed internally. <em>Take my strength, take whatever you need, just survive…</em>

Somehow, under my touch, he started to relax. His breathing got a little steadier. His eyes actually focused on something.

"What did you do?" said Justicar, impressed.

I pulled my hand back and sat on the floor, exhausted. "I… I gave him some of my blood," I said dizzily, not knowing how I knew.

"That doesn't make any sen–" Justicar interrupted herself. "Thank you for… whatever you did. Now please, stay out of the way."

I wasn't planning to move anyway, but I couldn't just let that stand. "What makes you think you have the right to tell me what to do?" I said forcefully.

Justicar didn't look away from the fallen human. "Farseer, is he stable? Is there more we need to do?"

Yali stepped up beside me and looked at him intently. Was she looking into the future? Her eyes had that same glazed look. "He is… not at risk of more physical harm," she said, still looking. After another moment, she added, "You should release the restraints."

"I understand." Justicar allowed the metal bands to awkwardly lower his limbs to the floor, then disappear. Once she was satisfied that he wasn't going to hurt himself, she turned back to me. "To answer your question, <em>someone</em> needs to be responsible in a crisis situation. Had you listened to me the first time, the trampoline would have been adequately reinforced. But instead, –"

"Are you fucking kidding me!! If I'd –"

"– your pride required you to do it yourself, when the <em>correct</em> choice was simply to stand aside and let the person with the needed abilities –"

"If I'd gone along with <em>your</em> way, he'd be splatted on your stupid dome right now!!"

"Did I not accept your alternative as soon as it was proposed?"

I opened my mouth to yell another retort, but Yali's hand fell heavily on my shoulder. "It's okay. He was in less danger than you both realize. Since his injuries weren't inflicted with hostile intent, they only damaged his body, never his soul. And the body can recover from almost anything, through manifesting." When she said <em>hostile intent</em>, she said it like it was a special phrase with its own meaning.

Justicar and I glared at each other silently. Before either of us thought of what to say next, we were interrupted by another voice. "Aww yesss, it's just like she said! Allllll manifested back together!!"

We all turned to look. He was already helping himself up onto his knees. It was pretty freaky to see him completely intact, so soon after he'd been all smashed up.

"Heyyy everybody! I'm Morrow! Morrow Monoë! Nice to meet'cha'll!" He jumped to his feet and hopped back-and-forth between one leg and another.

"What the fuck," I said. "That leg was just broken!"

"'Ow'm I gonna know it works if I don't try it??"

I grinned. "I <em>like</em> this guy," I said to no one in particular.

Justicar stepped forward. "If your body is whole again, that means you can tell us <em>what</em> you just did, and promise not to do anything like it again."

"I was in space! It was great! It was so weightless I actually vomited! I vomited in space, can you believe that!!" Morrow pulled a huge sandwich out of thin air and chomped into it.

"I asked, what did you <em>do</em> to –"

"I think he used a rocket," I said. "Remember he had burns all over him?" Sure enough, over in the wreckage there was a bunch of torn-up junk that might have been a rocket back when it was in one piece.

With one hand still holding the sandwich, Morrow waved dismissively with the other. Between bites, he mumbled, "I'll do a better one next time."

"There won't <em>be</em> a next time," snapped Justicar. "I will not allow you to endanger yourself and others like that!"

Morrow smiled tsuntingly. "You gonna stop me?"

[????? This was great]. I couldn't resist watching Morrow take the piss out of her. She took herself so seriously, and he completely blew her off, it was great. Apparently Yali didn't think so, though, because she quickly stepped up to spoil the fun. "Before we all argue, at least we should introduce ourselves. I'm Yali, and –"

"Yaliiiii! Nice't'meet'cha, wow, your mind is even better up close! I smelled it from space, but wow, that's a real emotional shell you've got there! Multi-layered and everything! I wonder what happens when it breaks??"

For a moment, we were all stunned into silence.

"You can smell people's minds??" I said, flabbergasted.

Justicar sized him up, frowning. "An Imminent with powers of the mind? Be warned, if you defile the minds of anyone here, your life is forfeit."

"Stern take it, do you threaten <em>everyone</em> you've just met?!" I exploded.

Morrow was already responding in his own way. "Oh don't worry, <em>Officer</em>, I wouldn't touch <em>your</em> mind with a ten-foot pole! I mean, ewww!" He held his nose and theatrically leaned away from her.

"I'm not a police officer," said Justicar stiffly.

"Yeah, yeah, bet you're a judge or summin'."

"I am not a –"

"When I lower my shell," interrupted Yali firmly, "it will be on my own terms."

"Yeah!" I yelled. "Don't try to mess with Yali, I'll fuck you up!"

"Excuse me?" said Justicar. "What did you just say about threatening people?"

"Wh– I said you threaten <em>everyone</em> you meet! You're two-for-two, I'm only one-for-two –"

"At most, I would be two-for-<em>three</em>. I did not threaten the Farseer."

"Oh you can shut right up about –"

"<em>We can argue later!</em>" thundered Yali. "We haven't even all introduced ourselves yet!"

"Very well." Justicar turned to Morrow stiffly. "You can call me Justicar."

"And I'm Rinn." I would normally have said my full name, but Yali had only said her first name, so I didn't want to make her the odd one out.

Morrow tossed his sandwich on the floor so he could shake my hand. "Rinn! Brilliant! Your mind is kick <em>ass</em>!"

I grinned. "You seem pretty kickass yourself," I said. Then, because I didn't want him to get the wrong idea, I added, "I'm gay, by the way."

"Brilliant! Betcha get all the girls!"

"Haha, yeah, that's me – Yali's my girlfriend though." Even if she <em>said</em> it was okay for me to go for other people, it still <em>felt</em> like I wasn't supposed to talk like that.

??????

[Morrow eating something as part of a scene]

"Hey, why do you eat so much?" I said. "You know we don't have to eat here, right?"

"But I'm <em>huuungry!!</em> I'm always hungry, even when I've eaten –"

"Wait, really? <em>I'm</em> not hungry, wait, can't you manifest yourself into not being hungry?" Curiously, I tried to manifest myself into <em>being</em> hungry. It worked.

"It is probably because of his nature as the Imminent," said Justicar. "It is the nature of the Seeking God to perpetually want more, and never be satisfied. Thus, ?????"

"That can't be right," I said. I didn't really have a <em>reason</em> to think it was wrong, but I couldn't stand Justicar being all <em>Well the Farseer would be like this and the Imminent would be like that</em> instead of listening to us as actual fucking people. So I scrambled to come up with a reason. "Hang on, if that was true, then all the old Imminents would have been hungry all the time too. Hey Yali, you have all those memories, so were they?"

Yali froze up, not answering.

"I did it!" yelled Morrow into the silence. "I manifested myself into not being hungry! But it's even worse, it's so tiring to stay like that, it's worse than just <em>being</em> hungr–"

"No, Yali, what's up? You okay there?"

"I, I, I –"

"[????? The Farseer shouldn't spill every piece of knowledge, said Justicar]"

Yali relaxed a bit.

"Wait," I said, "so you <em>were</em> keeping it secret on purpose? But why would <em>this</em> piece of knowledge be a secret?"

Justicar raised an eyebrow. "I suppose if all Imminents <em>were</em> hungry, she would have no reason not to tell us. So it follows that <em>not</em> all Imminents were hungry, and the difference would allow us to learn some sensitive information. Now…"

"Justicar," said Yali harshly.

"Yes?"

The air was thick with tension. What was going on? Why had Yali suddenly turned ice-cold?

Yali swallowed. Then she spoke slowly and deliberately, choosing each word with care. "You understand that I may have my own reasons to keep things hidden."

"What of it?"

"Then do not take knowledge from me that I have not willingly given to you."

[????? Justicar's reaction]

"I… apologize. I understand how I overstepped my bounds, and I will not do it again."

"Thank you."

?????

[????? Summary of interactions with Morrow, leading up to complaining about Morrow overloading Rinn the same way Rinn overloaded Yali]

[????? I almost cried laughing.] <em>Okay, universe, you get me fair and square.</em>

?????

[????? Morrow refers to the Alchemist as "he"]

"Or she," I said. "Or –"

"Sure maybe, but think about it! Right now we're three girls and one guy. So statistically, it'll probably be a dude."

"That's not how statistics works," said Justicar stiffly.

"Betcha Yali can tell us! I mean, we're gonna meet him in the future, right? And you can see the future! So you can see us meeting him, so you can see if he's a he!"

"The power of the Farseer is not to be used frivolously!" said Justicar.

"Hey! She can use it frivolously if she wants to!" I said. I turned to Yali. "So… do you want to?"

"No," said Yali.

"Okay that's it, case closed, the rest of you can fuck right off now."

?????

[????? Probably actually in chapter 8]

"Can be rest of you stop manifesting for a while?" said Yali suddenly.

"Sure, but why?" I said.

"It's the Seeing. It's –"

"Ooh! Ooh!" said Morrow. "Does it mess it up when he manifest? How does it work? Tell me!"

"The truth is, even though it's called the Seeing," began Yali patiently, "it's not much like seeing with my eyes. It's more like, sort of… holding very still, to <em>listen</em> for the future. And your manifesting is very… noisy. So it's hard to hear anything past what you're about to manifest."

"Oh! So – wait a minute, you just asked us to stop manifesting! So before that, you were <em>already</em> about to ask us to stop manifesting! So you shouldn't have seen us manifesting anything in the future! How does that make sense?!"

"I think, I think, maybe it's about the fact that it was <em>my</em> decision? I mean, I didn't decide to tell you until after I saw it, so maybe, maybe…"

"If the Farseer could reliably predict the results of the Farseer's own future decisions," Justicar cut in, "then what would happen if she foresaw a danger? Naturally, she would act to prevent the danger. But then the danger would never occur as she saw it. That would be a contradiction, so it follows that, <em>until</em> the Farseer has committed to a decision, she can still See the results of alternate decisions she could make." She looked to Yali. "Is that not so?"

"Something like that, yes."
