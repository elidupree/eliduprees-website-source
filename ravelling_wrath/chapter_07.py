<h2>Chapter 7: The Ravellers</h2>

Now that I got a closer look at her, the Justicar wasn't <em>that</em> tall. She had only looked that way because she had been standing above me. Of course, pretty much everyone looks tall to <em>me</em>, but really, she was only about Yali's height.

Still, she had a commanding presence. She wore her armor effortlessly, like she'd been born with it. And there was an actual <em>sword</em> resting at her side, long and straight. She could probably slice you to bits as soon as she looked at you. It would actually be pretty sexy, if she wasn't, you know, twice my age and also representing the Stern God.

And now she was asking us who was the Blood Child and who was the Farseer.

Yali answered. "She's Rinn. I'm Yali." She held out her hand, offering to shake hands. "We'll have time to talk about our roles later, but for now, –"

"I see," said the Justicar. "You are the Farseer."

Even though Yali wanted me to stay quiet, I couldn't resist. "How the f– Er, how did you know?"

The Justicar smiled grimly. "Her first words were to speak of the future. And now you have confirmed it, as <em>your</em> first words were spoken impulsively." She stepped towards me, her hand resting ominously on the hilt of her sword.

Yali stood in her way.

The Justicar's eyes narrowed. "Farseer, why do you stand with your back to the Blood Child? Do you not know the danger she poses?"

Yali spoke again, matching the Justicar's severe tone. "Rinn is no ordinary Blood Child. She will not harm me."

<em>Well, hopefully,</em> I thought.

"I do not understand," said the Justicar, not yielding a millimeter.

"Then I will explain. Through your connection with the Stern God, you have received the knowledge that the Blood God would endanger me. But the Blood God's will is very different from <em>Rinn's</em> will. She has no intention of acting on the Blood God's violence."

The Justicar's face flickered with doubt. "A nonviolent Blood Child…" she mused. Well, I wouldn't exactly call myself <em>nonviolent</em>, but I wasn't going to mention that in front of <em>her</em>. "But she still represents the rejuvenation of the Blood God. If it regains its strength…"

"Then it will rejuvenate from <em>Rinn's</em> soul. It will be influenced by her, just as much as it tries to influence others," said Yali. The Justicar hesitated. "I know it may be hard to understand, but you will understand in time. For now, I ask that you support me in handling the Blood Child how I have chosen." Yali held out her hand again.

After only a moment more in doubt, the Justicar straightened up, proud and professional again. "Very well," she said. She shook Yali's hand without wavering. Then she turned to me. Yali stepped aside to let her approach.

"Blood Child, do you swear that you will not harm the Farseer?"

I couldn't stand having some intimidating stranger demand that I swear to stuff, but I was supposed to make a good impression on her. And it wasn't like that was something I'd have a hard time swearing to. I put on my most solemn voice. It probably didn't sound completely sincere because I never did that kind of thing, but I was doing my best. "I swear before all the gods that I will not harm Yali," I said. I opened my hands to show that I wasn't planning to hurt anyone, and added, "Look, I love her. There's no way I could hurt her, it would tear me apart."

"Very well." The Justicar held out her hand. I shook it.

"So, uh, I'm Rinn. What's your name?"

"I –" The Justicar shook her head slightly, as if she was trying to shake off some unpleasant thought. "My human name doesn't matter here. Call me Justicar."
