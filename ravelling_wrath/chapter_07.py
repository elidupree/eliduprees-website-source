<h2>Chapter 7: The Ravellers</h2>

Now that I got a closer look at her, the Justicar wasn't <em>that</em> tall. She had only looked that way because she had been standing above me. Of course, pretty much everyone looks tall to <em>me</em>, but really, she was only about Yali's height.

Still, she had a commanding presence. She wore her armor effortlessly, like she'd been born with it. And there was an actual <em>sword</em> resting at her side, long and straight. She could probably slice you to bits as soon as she looked at you. It would actually be pretty sexy, if she wasn't, you know, twice my age and also representing the Stern God.

And now she was asking us who was the Blood Child and who was the Farseer.

Yali answered. "She's Rinn. I'm Yali." She held out her hand, offering to shake hands. "We'll have time to talk about our roles later, but for now, –"

"I see," said the Justicar. "You are the Farseer."

Even though Yali wanted me to stay quiet, I couldn't resist. "How the f– Er, how did you know?"

The Justicar smiled grimly. "Her first words were to speak of the future. And now you have confirmed it, as <em>your</em> first words were spoken impulsively." She stepped towards me, her hand resting ominously on the hilt of her sword.

Yali stood in her way.

The Justicar's eyes narrowed. "Farseer, why do you stand with your back to the Blood Child? Do you not know the danger she poses?"

Yali spoke again, matching the Justicar's severe tone. "Rinn is no ordinary Blood Child. She will not harm me."

<em>Well, hopefully,</em> I thought.

"I do not understand," said the Justicar, not yielding a millimeter.

"Then I will explain. Through your connection with the Stern God, you have received the knowledge that the Blood God would endanger me. But the Blood God's will is very different from <em>Rinn's</em> will. She has no intention of acting on the Blood God's violence."

The Justicar's face flickered with doubt. "A nonviolent Blood Child…" she mused. Well, I wouldn't exactly call myself <em>nonviolent</em>, but I wasn't going to mention that in front of <em>her</em>. "But she still represents the rejuvenation of the Blood God. If it regains its strength…"

"Then it will rejuvenate from <em>Rinn's</em> soul. It will be influenced by her, just as much as it tries to influence others," said Yali. The Justicar hesitated. "I know it may be hard to understand, but you will understand in time. For now, I ask that you support me in handling the Blood Child how I have chosen." Yali held out her hand again.

After only a moment more in doubt, the Justicar straightened up, proud and professional again. "Very well," she said. She shook Yali's hand without wavering. Then she turned to me. Yali stepped aside to let her approach.

"Blood Child, do you swear that you will not harm the Farseer?"

I couldn't stand having some intimidating stranger demand that I swear to stuff, but I was supposed to make a good impression on her. And it wasn't like that was something I'd have a hard time swearing to. I put on my most solemn voice. It probably didn't sound completely sincere because I never did that kind of thing, but I was doing my best. "I swear before all the gods that I will not harm Yali," I said. I opened my hands to show that I wasn't planning to hurt anyone, and added, "Look, I love her. There's no way I could hurt her, it would tear me apart."

"Very well." The Justicar held out her hand. I shook it.

"So, uh, I'm Rinn. What's your name?"

"I –" The Justicar shook her head slightly, as if she was trying to shake off some unpleasant thought. "My human name doesn't matter here. Call me Justicar."

?????

[Suddenly,] Yali jerked out of her [Seeing]. "Something's coming!!" she shouted.

I jumped up, every part of me snapping to alert. "What's coming? Where?"

"A, a – a human!" Yali pointed wildly towards the sky. "Very fast, going to crash!"

"A human from the sky?" I confusedly looked where she was pointing, but didn't see anything. But Justicar was already in action. She raised her arms in front of her, in a powerful stance. All around us, a steel dome began to form, with a rigid network of supporting bars making it look almost impossible to break. Where in the Endless did she learn to manifest like that?! I couldn't make anything half as big, and she did it without even touching the stuff she was creating.

My heart was pounding. I hardly knew what was happening – but there was one thing I knew for sure. "Hey, stop that!" I yelled. "Whoever's coming is gonna smash into this! You'll get them killed!" Justicar barely noticed me, so I jammed a Blood Blade into the structure of the partially-formed dome, disrupting how she was building it.

"What do you propose?" she said sharply. All her muscles were tensed up as she concentrated on keeping the dome intact.

"I don't know, what about catching them in a big net? Or, like, a trampoline –"

"Do it then – we don't have much time!" Justicar dropped her hands to her sides, allowing the dome to fall to pieces and vanish. Frantically, I filled the space by manifesting a big trampoline.

"They'll bottom out on that!"

"I fucking know that! We'll put it up at an angle so it catches them in midair –" I followed where Yali was pointing, and heaved the trampoline up at an angle, barely keeping it steady with my arms. "Now support this with some of your metal bars!"

"Fine!" Justicar raised her arms again, and more metal beams snapped into place, holding up half the trampoline. "Move over, you're in the way of the other side –"

"Here, I'll do these –" I manifested the first thing I could think of – more Blood Blades, but this time, distorted into long poles that flowed and merged with the trampoline on one hand and the floor of our star on the other.

"That's a weak structure, you need to reinforce it with –" Justicar stepped towards me, arms held out to add to my work –

"GET DOWN!!!" yelled Yali. She grabbed my arm and threw me with her full weight, sending me to tumbling off towards the edge of the star. And then everything exploded.

In an instant, an overwhelming pain had smashed through limbs I didn't know I'd had. And then after the first shock, there was a burning so strong it brought tears to my eyes. But I had my own fire inside of me, and I wouldn't be beaten so easily. Biting back the pain, I forced myself to climb to my feet and look back at the wreckage.

The sounds echoed into my mind. The loud snap of the Blood Blades shattering and the trampoline tearing apart. The crash of collapsing metal. And the thud and crack as a human body smashed onto the surface of the star.

He lay sprawled on the floor, a mass of blood with one arm torn open and one leg twisted at a horrible angle under him. My heart caught in my throat as I struggled towards him. For an awful moment I was sure he was dead.

Then he opened his mouth and screamed, a deafening scream that pounded at my eardrums ?????.

Justicar didn't delay an instant. She was already standing over him. In a flash, heavy bindings tightened around the bleeding arm. The next moment, more steel slammed into existence around all his arms and legs, locking him in place and yanking the broken leg back around to ?????.

"Manifest it back together!" Justicar yelled at him. "Manifest your leg back together before the damage gets worse!"

He didn't hear her. His eyes stared wildly into the distance, oblivious to everything around him. He screamed again, jerking and struggling against the bars, his voice getting ragged.

"Stop struggling! You're only making it worse!" Justicar made more steel bands around his elbows and forehead, constraining his movement even further.

"What the fuck, Justicar, you think he can hear you like that??" I was only a few steps away. I stubbornly forced one foot in front of the other. If only I could get to him in time –

"What do you propose?!"

"Let me help him!"

"What are you going to do??"

"I don't know!!!"

"That's not good enough! I can't let you complicate things when he's in critical cond–" Justicar stepped towards me to block me from getting closer, but she was too late. I fell forward on to my knees, ducking under her arm, and slumped forward far enough to put my hand on the injured person's chest. Desperately, I tried to wish for anything that could help. I imagined pushing warm, healing energy into him, as if I could manifest him back to health. <em>Please just survive,</em>, I prayed internally. <em>Take my strength, take whatever you need, just survive…</em>

Somehow, under my touch, he started to relax. His breathing got a little steadier. His eyes actually focused on something.

"What did you do?" said Justicar, impressed.

"I… I gave him some of my blood," I said dizzily, not knowing how I knew.

"That doesn't make any sen–" Justicar interrupted herself. "Thank you for… whatever you did. Now please, stay out of the way." She went back to
