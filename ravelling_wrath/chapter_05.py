<h2>On the discussion of sexual assault</h2>

<p>I was very careful about how I wrote the scene where Rinn thinks about the rape, and I'm still not sure I handled it 100% correctly. I've heard a lot of stories be (rightly) criticized for overly focusing on a male character's feelings about a female character being raped, and I didn't want to have similar problems here. Like a lot of those male characters, Rinn has a lot of overprotective rage that Yali explicitly does not want. I didn't want to just glamorize that. But that's also a real situation and a real feeling that a lot of people encounter in their lives. So I wanted to write a story that represents a <em>better</em> way of handling it. To show the reader that even when you feel rage, you can still respect the other person's agency and choices.</p>

<p>I also specifically made sure to have Rinn say "don't tell me someone raped you" instead of "don't tell me you were raped", and "must've had somebody do that to them" instead of "must've had that happen to them". I don't want to portray rape as something that just happens to people, because that downplays the role of the aggressor. Fortunately, this is consistent with Rinn's way of thinking – I didn't even have to tweak that way of thinking from how I've been developing it already! Rinn's a very active person, in the sense that ze almost always takes active roles rather than passive roles. That colors how ze thinks about other people, too. Rinn's first thought is always to focus on the aggressor's actions, rather than focusing on the suffering of person being hurt. That isn't <em>always</em> the best way to think about things, but it worked out well for this particular detail.</p>

<h2>A subtlety from Chapter 3</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="/ravelling-wrath/3/discussion">author's notes for Chapter 3</a>, I often want the reader to know something, but can't communicate it because the narrator doesn't know it. Here's one from Chapter 3 itself, which I couldn't explain at the time… but I <em>can</em> explain it now, now that you've read Chapter 5. In this exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It wasn't a real relationship, we were just horny teenagers." That felt a little weird to say. "Ha ha, Waiting God knows I'm still a horny teenager. Buuu-uuut I'm in a real relationship now –" I squeezed Yali's hand "– and I'm fine if you want to take it slow."</p>

<p>"Uh… right," said Yali. "Go on with the story!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On one hand, Yali was <em>almost</em> going to react affectionately to Rinn correcting zemself twice. But then Rinn mentioned the "take it slow" thing, and as we know from Chapter 5, the truth is more complicated than that. Yali was distracted from being affectionate by a brief internal struggle about how to respond, and eventually settled on avoiding the issue.</p>

<p>And then <em>Rinn didn't notice any of it!</em> Not only was it totally out of character for Rinn to notice at that moment, but neither of them would be likely to remember that exact exchange, so I had no chance of going back and explaining it later in the story. At most, I could have added something like "Yali seemed flustered for some reason". But since I want to establish that Yali doesn't show discomfort very much, it's not right to use that line unless this exact exchange hits one of zir biggest vulnerabilities – and it doesn't. All I could do was leave a couple of subtle hints – the fact that Yali says "Uh", which isn't zir usual response, and then answers with the single word "right", which ze only did in Chapter 2 when ze was trying to avoid thinking about something. Rinn's statement is, in fact, <em>not</em> right, because Yali doesn't technically <em>want</em> to take it slow. Instead, the "right" is in the sense of "Oh right, that's how you think of it given that I haven't told you the whole story."</p>

<p>I wouldn't usually explain this kind of details in the author's notes, because it can be cool when you reread the earlier chapters and notice them for yourself. But since this one is particularly complex <em>and</em> particularly hard to guess, I decided it could be interesting to write about it here. There's still plenty of other things to notice on a second reading. ;-)</p>

<h2>What if Yali was trans?</h2>

<p>With the line "I'd have to deal with something I'm not ready to deal with yet", you might also wonder if Yali might be trans, and hesitating about disclosing zir trans status. However, that's not the direction I'm going with it. There's already a lot of stories about trans characters with lots of trauma. When I write a trans character, I'd rather make a more comforting portrayal.</p>

<p>That said, feel free to headcanon that Yali is trans if you like! The story works just as well regardless of Yali's assigned gender. There's just a few things I would clarify if it was different. If Yali is transfeminine, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yali thought it was important to tell Rinn about that. So, the same time ze used the Seeing to determine whether Rinn would say yes to a date, ze also checked how Rinn would react to zem disclosing zir trans status.</li>
<li>Rinn thinks that trans people are kickass, because fuck the rules. So Rinn already knows, because Yali told zem about it right away.</li>
<li>Yali knew ze was female from a very young age. All zir caregivers accepted that part of zem, at least most of the time. (I can't give too many details here because of spoilers, but those relationships can be mostly the same regardless of gender stuff.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the other characters would also work pretty well with a different assigned gender, or even with a different actual gender. The one exception is Rinn – I feel like Rinn might be the most gender-specific character I've ever written, and I'd have to change a lot more details to be comfortable making zem anything other than cis female.</p>

  [????? this whole chapter needs to be tightened up a little, and also needs better medium-term promises ("what are they trying to accomplish by relaxing?")]
  [????? Opening diction isn't quite consistent with how I've developed Yali, and the fun stuff has a couple paragraphs more than necessary]
  

"– I just really, really, need a break," I finished.

[????? We were in Yali's living room, and she had been looking more and more stressed as I explained everything; maybe, I was worried about how she would answer]

[????? "I'm sorry. I never meant to make you burn yourself out. I, I, you, we <em>do</em> need a break. If you push yourself past your limits, it'll hurt you in the long run, so it's definitely better if we make time to relax –"

[????? I instantly knew ????? It was the opposite of what I'd thought. Yali wasn't trying to reassure <em>me</em> –] she was trying to convince <em>herself</em>.

"– and what if [????? we end up with a bad relationship] ????? or [????? we get to the ravelling and have nothing to look forward to and so bad things happen]? ????? –"

I put a hand on her arm. "What's wrong?" I said gently.

????? "I, I, it's just, ????? It's hard to get myself to stop thinking about it. Like… when you argued with Pèi, that was actually a big breakthrough, so now, I can't stop thinking, what if you need to go further with that? But I <em>know</em> I need to let you rest –"

I almost laughed. "Come on, when you think something good happened, that makes you worry <em>more</em>? Forget <em>rest</em> – we ought to be <em>celebrating!</em>"

"You're not wrong…" Yali's arm was tense under my hand. "Okay. Maybe I can make this work. And I do have something I want to celebrate…"

"What is –"

Yali surged to her feet. She spun around in the middle of her living room and flexed her muscles. "By the Stern, this is the best I've felt about my body in ages!"

I looked her up and down. "Fuck yeah," I said. "You look ready to kick ass."

Yali got a weird look on her face. "Fight me," she said.

I laughed, thinking she was joking. [????? She gave me a weird look. "What are you laughing at?" she said. (Maybe reduce to just "but then I could tell I was wrong"]

"Wait, like, you meant <em>actually</em> fight you?" I said. That couldn't possibly be right, could it?

"Why not?"

"Ooo-kay," I got up and stepped forwards, "but I'm warning you, I – woOOOAH!!!" As soon as I'd gotten close to her, she'd given me a shove that almost lifted me off my feet. I was totally caught off guard and I didn't catch my balance until I stumbled into a wall. Catching my breath, I gasped out, "I didn't know you were going to be serious!"

"When am I not serious?" Yali grinned wickedly. She was already stepping towards me like she was moving in for the kill. My heart leapt into my throat. Was this really happening? Yali <em>never</em> got this energetic, this… <em>physical.</em> We'd hug and kiss and stuff, but that was gentle, it just wasn't the same. But now… A thrill shot through me. Every part of my body was suddenly charged up and ready to go.

I jumped forward to meet her. We collided and grappled our way across the room, bumping into furniture as we went. She was good at it, too, I couldn't get the advantage of her easily. I stepped back and then lunged at her, trying to get her off balance, but she was as solid as a rock. Not expecting that, I made one wrong step and lost my footing. Then it was her turn to take advantage. She surged forward, bearing my body backwards until I thudded into a wall.

I gasped for breath. Yali was leaning into me, pinning me against the wall with her full weight. Her body rubbed against mine as I tried to squirm away, making my skin explode with feeling. Oh gods, this was turning me on! I heaved my body left and right, trying to get free, but all I managed to do was squish into her at different angles. She was squashing the air out of my lungs, too, I couldn't even breathe all the way.

"No fair," I gasped.

My heart was pounding like a jackhammer. I was sandwiched, my back against the wall, my front engulfed by Yali's huge, warm, <em>powerful</em> body. She kept grinding up on me, shifting to a different angles to keep me pinned. In between movements, she managed to grunt a response. "Unfair, what, because I'm a heavyweight and you're a, a –"

"No no no I didn't mean –"

"Rinn, Rinn, Rinn," she said affectionately, "you don't have to worry about mentioning my weight. It's <em>you</em>, I know you're not being mean about it." We both paused for a bit to catch our breath. It was weird, but somehow, she was the most relaxed I'd ever seen her. "Say, how much do you weigh?"

"Er – I think I was 45 kilos last time I was at the doctor –"

Yali grinned from ear to ear. "This is great! I'm 90, I weigh <em>literally</em> twice as much as you!"

"Uh…"

Yali barked out with laughter. "Ha ha, you'll never beat me! I lift twice your weight every morning before breakfast! Ha ha ha ha ha!" She grabbed me around the waist, lifted me into the air, and spun me around.

"Aaaaaah ha ha ha ha ha –"

Yali practically <em>threw</em> me onto the couch. Then she thumped down beside me and cuddled up to me. She leaned in and started planting kisses all over my face. I kissed back eagerly, shoving my lips onto her face as hard as I could get away with. Gods, I couldn't handle how much I loved her. I'd almost thought I would never get a chance like this.

We pulled back to catch our breaths, but definitely not to stop. Even from hearing her <em>breathe</em>, I could tell how excited she was. She was panting like a normal person, not doing some sort of regulated breathing like she did at the gym. We were both so full of energy.

"Soo-ooo…" I said slyly, "the two young lovebirds are about to go on a terrible journey… Who knows when they'll get another chance to be together like this…"

The energy drained out of her. "You want to have sex," she said neutrally.

<em>Shit.</em>

"We don't have to if you don't want to," I said hastily. "I just meant, if you wanted to, we could, uh, you know, but if you didn't want to, that's fine, I don't want to push you into anyth–" I babbled, heat rising in my cheeks.

"If I didn't <em>want</em> to," echoed Yali, in a strange tone. It was subtle, but did she say it almost <em>bitterly</em>? "But I <em>do</em> want to. I want to <em>so</em> much. I have, I have, <em>wanted</em>, ever since I <em>saw</em> you."

She was still cuddling up to me, she was still so warm, but something cold was gripping my heart. I didn't know what to think. "Uh, I thought you always said you wanted to take it slow, what do you mean…? You think it'd mess something up between us? For the Ravelling?" I guessed, hoping it was something that simple. But her face was like a stone wall. I could tell I was nowhere near the truth.

"What I mean is, I mean, I, I, I," she took a breath. Her calm focus was back again. "I can't. I'd have to deal with something I'm not ready to deal with yet."

What? What did she mean by that? A million possibilities ran through my head, but none of them made sense. Was it, like, a medical issue? But Yali always took care of that stuff right away! How could she be "not ready", unless it was, like, if it wasn't a physical thing, like…

I blurted it out without thinking. "Don't tell me someone raped you!"

Yali paused for a long time. I felt like my stomach was going to flip over. <em>Fuck, what if it's true?! What's she thinking? Oh gods, I shouldn't have said that, I shouldn't have said that…</em>

Finally, she spoke. "If I say yes, will you promise not to bring it up again until I say I'm ready?"

"Of course," I breathed.

"It was a long time ago. It wasn't anyone you know. They're in prison now."

"Shiiiiiit. Oh gods, I'm so sorry, how did it happen, I have so many questions –" I clamped my mouth shut. Shit, I shouldn't have said that, I kept saying things without thinking, what if she –

"Don't ask them," she said matter-of-factly, thank the gods. "Let's talk about something else." And then: "You're hurting my arms, by the way."

Belatedly, I realized that I'd been holding her forearms in a white-knuckled grip. With effort, I made my hands unclench. Then I saw the discolored marks my grip had left on her. "Oh fuck, oh gods, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to –"

"Don't worry about it," she said, massaging her arms carefully. Then she shifted and lay heavily on the couch beside me. We were still touching a little, but it wasn't the same. "Let's talk about something else," she repeated.

"Uh, what do you want to…" I tried to think of something to talk about, anything, but my mind was racing, I couldn't think of anything else.

"How about you tell me more of your irresponsible stories? We never did –"

"Woah, I can't believe we forgot about that! I never even told you about how I broke my leg!"

"Ooh, tell me!" It was weird how quickly Yali started acting excited again. After hearing what I'd just heard, there was no <em>way</em> I could put it out of my mind. But I <em>did</em> really want to tell her my stories. Maybe it would be enough to distract me.

"So, you know the big tree near the elementary school? Oh, I guess maybe you don't, 'cause you only moved in last year. But, you can sort of see it when you walk down the –"

"Oh, the one with the fence around it?"

I grinned. "I'm the reason that fence is there." Yali's eyes widened a little. I really got a kick out of impressing her, even now. The fact that I was <em>grinning</em> while telling the story was a little forced, but that <em>was</em> how I would've felt about it any other time.

I went on, "Kids used to dare each other to climb that tree all the time. We weren't allowed to go near it, but that's why it was fun. And everyone loved giving <em>me</em> dares, they were like 'Rinn's crazy, she'll do anything'. I did all kinds of stuff, like, I jumped off the swings and everything. So first, they told me to climb the tree, and I was like [????? 'easy peasy'] and I did it. And the next time, they said to climb out on the big branch, so I did that too. And so on. The adults kept trying to punish me, but as soon as I was done with one punishment I would go right back out and do more dares. They finally gave up and started trying to punish the kids who <em>gave</em> me the dares, but obviously they couldn't catch them all the time. So finally, someone dared me to climb out on the branch and dance [????? a jig] on it, and I was like, 'that sounds awesome!', so I did it, but I lost my footing and fell out of the tree, and that's how I broke my leg."

[????? "That must have really hurt!"]

"Oh yeah, it hurt loads. And then I had to wear a cast <em>forever</em> and I couldn't go running outdoors or anything, and it <em>itched</em> under the cast, it was so annoying –"

Yali started giggling uncontrollably.

"What's so funny?"

"You were, you were, in loads of pain," she forced out, "and it isn't even <em>interesting</em> to you!"

"Uh, yeah? I mean it wasn't for very long." That only made her giggle harder. Eventually, she got herself under control and told me to keep going.

"Okay. So I guess I didn't <em>actually</em> have the cast on forever, but it <em>felt</em> like forever, it was awful. So yeah, after that, I didn't do <em>everything</em> people dared me into. I mean, I still did some stuff, I just didn't do the stupid ones. BUT!! Okay, so first, after I broke my leg, all the adults were freaking out like 'oh no, this tree is very dangerous, we have to do something about the danger to the children', and I told everyone who would <em>listen</em> that it was just me, like, literally none of the other kids would do something that stupid, but <em>apparently</em>, 'parents were worried', so they built that fence around it. BUT ANYWAY, I wasn't gonna let some stupid tree get the best of me, so the first thing I did after I got the cast off was, I went to climb out on the branch again. And that's when I learned how to climb a fence, too."

I pulled up the leg of my pants. "Here," I said, "let me show you my scar from the fall!"

"That long thin one? That looks like it was painful!"

"Nah, that one's different, that's from when I jumped out my window. That's a good one, I should tell you that next. And this one –" I showed her a scar on my knuckle "– this one's from when I got bitten by a squirrel. And –"

"You got bitten by a <em>squirrel</em>?"

"Oh yeah, don't mess with squirrels, they're nasty little buggers. So what happened was, I was a little kid, and my dad saw how much I liked running around outside, so he got me a butterfly net. But there were hardly any butterflies around and whenever I did spot one, it just flew away, they were annoying to catch. So instead I caught a squirrel."

"You caught a squirrel in a butterfly net?"

"I mean, it tore its way out right away –"

"But… don't squirrels run away from people?"

"You've just gotta sneak up on them. Play it cool, like you're just passing by. I swear, they can tell if you're looking at them. Sure, they usually get away, but, this one time, I finally managed to catch one in my net. And then I tried to grab it, 'cause I thought I was going to be able to bring the squirrel home and show my dad and that would be awesome. But it tore through the net and bit half my knuckle off and ran away. Dad made me go to the doctor because he was worried about rabies, even though I was like, 'look, I attacked the squirrel, not the other way around'. And I was fine, all I got was this scar."

Yali held my knuckle gently in her fingers and took a close look at it. It was super intimate. "I, I, I don't have anything with such a cool story, but," she shifted her arm to show me something. On the heel of her hand, there was a faint scar. Big and blotchy, but faint. "I was five. I put my hand on a cooktop that was still on." 

I wasn't sure how to respond. It felt like she was trying to open up to me, but I just didn't know what to say. The moment passed. "Tell me another one," Yali said.

I told her my stories all evening. She was totally into it. I completely lost track of time, I was so caught up in telling her about all the fun times I'd had. Finally, Yali had to remind me that I'd planned to go home with enough time to get at least <em>some</em> sleep for the next day.

On my way home, I realized I haven't even remembered to get back to telling her the one about how I jumped out a window. Stern take it, that was a good one! Well, we'd have plenty of time for me to tell that on another day.

<bigbreak>

It wasn't until I was at home in my room, getting ready for bed, that it came back into my mind.

<em>It was a long time ago. It wasn't anyone you know.</em>

Images sprang unwanted into my head. A much younger Yali, naked and scared. A strange man, holding her down. Forcing himself on her. Violating her.

I felt like my head would split open. A chaos of feelings ripped through me. Disgust. Horror. And finally, rage, uncontrollable rage. I wanted to <em>murder</em> that man. I wanted to feel my fists sink into his flesh, to beat him and beat him until he was a bloody mess on the floor. Where was he now?! If I just knew where he was, I would make him pay for what he did! I'd go there tonight –!

<em>They're in prison now.</em>

I <em>knew</em> there was nothing I could do. I <em>knew</em> it was already over. But the images kept coming back, over and over, as if they were permanently stamped into my head. The man raping Yali. Me brutalizing the man. Every fresh image slammed into me with a crash of pain, of knowing that nothing I could do would change anything.

<em>It was a long time ago. It wasn't anyone you know. They're in prison now.</em>

She'd planned for this. Of <em>course</em> she had. She knew what I'd think – first, <em>who was it?!?</em>, and then, <em>I'll kill them!!!</em>. And she'd known exactly what to say to deny me. With those two short sentences, she'd ripped away everything I was reaching for.

<em>It wasn't anyone you know. They're in prison now.</em>

Why the fuck did it have to be that way?! I mean, I obviously wasn't mad that they were in prison. But I couldn't stand not being able to <em>do</em> anything. And if they were already in prison, it was just… <em>over</em>.

Wait… She'd said "they". Not "he". Was she trying to leave out their gender? Maybe it <em>wasn't</em> a man? Or were there <em>more than one of them?!?</em>

The rage surged through me again. I slammed my fist into the wall, putting a new dent alongside all the old ones. I slammed it again and again, splitting my knuckle on the broken-up wallboard. But the pain didn't end. Gods, what did she want me to do? What the fuck did she want me to do?

Wait. What <em>did</em> she want me to do?

Well. First of all, she wanted me to not bring it up again. I would absolutely do that, she was the victim here, I would do whatever it took to make her feel better. But what would she want me to do with my own feelings? I couldn't just not feel them!

Or… <em>could</em> I?

The terrifying thing was, there was already a part of me that was saying, <em>Calming Game</em>. Already a bit of my rage that was fading into doubt. Was it even right? Should I be able to know something like this, and <em>not</em> be blinded by rage? But… that <em>was</em> what she'd want. She'd want me to know that someone raped her, and just <em>not</em> put holes in the wall. Just <em>not</em> murder anyone. Just… keep going on.

The tension left me. I flopped down on my bed. <em>Fuck.</em>

Lying limply on my back, I stared up at the ceiling, letting the cold truth sink into me. Someone had raped Yali, and I knew now, and the only thing I could do was… nothing. I felt empty. Drained. Helpless.

<em>Anger turns helplessness into strength.</em> Bullshit. It hadn't turned my helplessness into anything but pain.

How was I supposed to handle it? I'd never had to deal with something like this before.

It's not like I didn't know <em>about</em> rape. There was a guerrilla feminist club at school who'd posted flyers all over the place with the statistics. I'd freaked myself out plenty of times thinking about how many of my friends must've had somebody do that to them, or worse, done it to somebody else. But to actually <em>know</em>… and about someone so close to me…

I wasn't the kind of person who really had people confiding in me. I was the "fun friend". Or if I did get into serious stuff, half the time I'd make a mess of it, like I did with Tierze. But this wasn't just some random person I knew. This was Yali.

<p><em>Yali</em>.</p>

How many horrors was she fighting through? Not only this, but also the other things… I didn't know the details, but there were the people she had to hide her Chosen-ness from… there was the reason she lived alone…

Another cold realization washed over me.

<p>"It's the Stern Temple that pays for me to live here," she'd said. Well, <em>the Stern courts were responsible for compensation paid to victims of crimes</em>. So if there was a crime that meant she needed a new home… a crime involving her parents… could they be dead? Could they have been her abusers?</p>

And had she had to go through a trial? Of her own parents? Of their killers?

How many layers of badass <em>was</em> she?

My mind turned these worries over and over, late into the night, until sleep was finally heavier than they were. There was nothing I could do to loosen the cold grip on my heart, to make it seem like it wasn't so bad. And my way of picturing Yali kept flopping back and forth, never able to settle, between the Yali who was isolated and suffering, and the Yali who stepped out of it all, grimly ready to defy the gods.

As I slipped into unconsciousness, the only thing I knew for sure was that I was up against something much, much bigger than me.

<img class="sketch" src="/media/ravelling-wrath/sketches/ch5.jpg?rr" alt="">

<bigbreak>

The day finally came.

I rose with the dawn. The sun glowed like in my dream, filling my blood with energy. I was ready.

[????? Nobody needs Rinn doubting this:] I couldn't <em>technically</em> say I was ready, but for some reason, I <em>felt</em> ready. I went through my morning routine on autopilot, my mind racing ahead to what was coming.

Yali had told me all about it. Normally, even the high priests didn't know exactly what day the Ravelling would start, although obviously it was usually during the official Ravelling Week. But Yali, as the Farseer, was able to sense when it was coming, a few days ahead of time. By now, she'd told me the exact day and hour it would happen. We were going to meet up this morning, and in a few hours, we'd be pulled through to the Otherworld.

I had planned to leave in the morning as if I was going to school like normal, without letting Mom and Dad know there was anything [????? out of the ordinary]. I almost did it, too. But as I was stepping out the front door, I felt like I was crossing a point of no return. I hesitated and turned around.

"Hey Mom. Hey Dad. I love you so, so much."

Mom sighed. "What do you want?"

I almost laughed. Somehow, I hadn't expected her to turn my [????? super serious] emotions into regular annoyance. "I just want you to know how much I love you! Is that so wrong?" She didn't look very convinced. "Come on, I'm a teenager! I'm allowed to have mood swings! You too –" I jabbed a finger at Dad "– get over here!"

I grabbed them and hugged them both tight. They exchanged a look, but went along with it. Oh, they had no idea what was coming. But I knew.

"Bye! Love ya!"

I took off running down the road towards the school. But as soon as I was out of sight of my house, I turned and took a different road.

<p class="text left">on my way to clover square eta 20 min</p>
<p class="text left">ill have something for you</p>
<p class="text left">don't tire yourself out on the way here, we'll have a lot more walking to do</p>

<p class="text right">on my way! see you soon! ❤</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

I snickered at "<em>more</em> walking", as if I was actually going to walk this first part. I was itching to run, to get there as soon as I could. But just for her, I held myself to somewhere in the middle, and settled into an easy jog.

It was the last time I was going to be running these streets for a long time. I lovingly landed my feet in every familiar pothole and crack. Over there was the first bar I ever got kicked out of. A few blocks down, the corner store where Pèi stole most of her jewelry. The old half-a-basketball-court where I used to play with the neighborhood kids until the hoop fell down and people started dumping their trash there, haha.

[????? Revise all discussion of "gates" in this chapter (the walls no longer have "main gates"), and also, probably rename the "gates" in chapter 8 and elsewhere]

It was a long jog. Eventually I got to the wall between the fifth and fourth rings, and headed up through its main gate, which was pretty close to Clover Square. With each place I passed, I wondered if I'd ever see it again. Would I ever be back to that pawnshop near the library, where I sometimes stopped to flirt with the owner's bored daughter? Would I ever race someone down Draegel Street? There were just so many memories here. The skate park. Carminh's house. The road leading to Layo's… Stern take it, just looking that way made me miss the shit out of him.

It wouldn't be long till I was there. I stopped thinking and just jogged, feeling the wind blow over my face and arms. It was cold, but I was getting plenty warmed up anyway. It was good to be alive.

When I got to Clover Square, I didn't see Yali anywhere. I was about to text her again, to ask when she'd get there, when I felt her hand land on my shoulder. She led me into a corner and handed me a shapeless gray hoodie that was a couple sizes too big for me. I obediently pulled it over my head and wriggled my arms into the sleeves. Yali was wearing one just like it, keeping her face well back under the hood.

"I don't want anyone to recognize us on our way to the fountain," she said. [????? The fountain was something we'd discussed earlier.] We were going to go to the fountain at the center of the first ring, where the boundary between this world and the Otherworld was the thinnest. Apparently, the actual process of getting pulled through the boundary was going to be a really weird experience, and if it didn't go just right, we might end up getting flung to faraway parts of the Otherworld instead of arriving at the same place as each other. But it would be easier if we were near the fountain, instead of just being pulled through from wherever we happened to be. "We'll take a bus up to the second ring, then walk from there."

"Why not all the way?"

"Buses don't go up there."

"Oh."

We walked to the nearest bus stop and waited. It was cold, cloudy, and damp, and it felt like it could rain at any moment. I fidgeted with my hood. I'd never liked wearing a hood, it was annoying the way I couldn't see everything around me.

"Keep your hood up," Yali hissed.

I did what she said. "What's up with all this secrecy, though?" I said. "Aren't we about to leave this world anyway?"

Yali whispered back, "I don't want anyone to be sure that we're Ravellers, even after we get back."

"But… we're going to disappear <em>now</em>, then reappear <em>then</em>. Won't it be obvious?"

"It's not just the Ravellers who disappear on Ravelling Week. There's –"

"What? There's <em>more</em> magic stuff?!"

"No, I mean… Kidnappings. Runaways. Star-crossed lovers. Anyone who wants to create some doubt about why they disappeared. Who's going to look for you if they think you're not in the world anymore, right? Realistically, there's more fakers than actual Ravellers. So with us –"

"Haha, yeah, how likely is it that we'd <em>both</em> be chosen? Everyone will think we're the star-crossed lovers for sure."

"Actually, I think we might <em>literally</em> be star-crossed lovers."

"What?"

"'Star-crossed' means that fate is against us. That definitely fits. Ironically, because –"

"But, don't you have to, uh, have sex, to count as 'lovers'?"

Yali blinked, flustered. "What? The word is 'lovers', we love each other, that should be enough! Besides, we're probably going to <em>eventually</em>, I, I, I –"

"But by then, we might not be star-crossed anymore! This is very important!" I joked.

It took Yali a moment to realize that I was joking, but then she laughed loudly. Then she looked around furtively. But she hadn't drawn any attention. It was a damp day and it felt like it was about to rain, so everyone was hurrying to where they were going, not paying attention to random people across the street like us.

"I think that's our bus," muttered Yali.

I held Yali's hand for the whole bus ride there. Neither of us spoke. We had so much to say, but most of it had already been said, and the rest could wait until there were fewer people to overhear us.

Along the way, the rain began, a loud patter on the metal roof. Water streaked the windows, making it harder to see outside. It felt isolating. But there was nothing out there I hadn't seen before. There was the big main gate into the third ring. The dull, square Stern buildings. The menacing walls of the prison off in the distance. Was that where…? No, that wasn't worth thinking about, not when Yali was right next to me. I tried to focus on the trip. We passed by a busy gas station. We rolled through the weirdly hidden gate into the second ring, which you almost couldn't see until you got close to it.

Finally, we reached the last stop and shuffled off the bus with everyone. By the time Yali stepped out into the rain, she already had her phone out, showing the route to where we were going. She waved for me to follow, and started walking without saying a word.

[????? Diction in this paragraph is slightly off, and imperfect for the mood] The second ring didn't quite look how I remembered it. I guess that shouldn't have been a surprise, since I'd been a little kid last time I was here. And it was still way different from back at home. The buildings were big, brightly colored, and completely mismatched with each other. On one side of the street you'd have a worn-out old brick storefront, and on the other, you'd have some modern-art sort of building with weird angles and glass-panelled walkways sticking out all over the place. I couldn't resist looking around at everything. But every time I glanced back at Yali, she was still just paying attention to the directions on her phone. Which, to be fair, was the only reason we weren't getting lost.

"Yali?" I said. She didn't look up from her silent concentration. "Hey, Yali!"

"Shhhh." She still didn't look up at me. A few paces later, she continued, "Don't say my name."

"Oh, right. Sorry, I didn't think of that." Ugh, it felt weird that I wasn't getting a reaction out of her. It was like the bond between us had somehow been cut when I wasn't looking. Why was she acting like that? Well, when I thought about it, this was probably really stressful for her too. But at least <em>she</em> knew what it was going to be <em>like</em> when we got sucked into the Otherworld. All <em>I</em> had to go on was her descriptions – and she had said it was "mindbending" and "not actually dangerous", which wasn't exactly reassuring. Whatever, I could put up with it. I went back to looking around while I followed her, to give her a little space. More streets went past. My hoodie slowly got more damp in the rain.

At last, the first ring's wall loomed above us. We didn't <em>get</em> there right away – we were still on the second ring's twisty roads, so even once we could see the wall over the shorter buildings, there was still a lot of zigzagging before we got to the actual gate. But we got there.

At first glance, the Waiting Gate didn't look like much. For being one of the main gates, it was pretty small, only wide enough to fit one car at a time. But once I got close, I could see the details. Every part of the stonework around the gate was carved into finely shaped curves. The shapes looked somehow geometric and organic at the same time. And at the top of the gate, they all intertwined into a big version of the Waiting God's symbol, the Watchful Eye.

I paused under the gate to run my fingers through the grooves in the carvings. They were way smoother than I expected. "Wooaah…" I said. "I can't even feel the gaps between the stones."

Yali stood ahead of me impatiently. I hurried to catch up.

On the other side of the gate, the city looked way different. [????? It was like night and day.] The roads around here weren't even paved normally, they were all cobblestones instead. And all the buildings were kind of… shorter than usual. Not just fewer multi-story buildings, but lower roofs and shorter doors as well. Wouldn't be a problem for me or even Yali, but someone as tall as Dehel would be hitting their head all the time.

And a lot of the buildings had stone walls with carvings like the ones on the gate. I'd have expected that kind of thing from a temple, but even regular shops and stuff had them.

"Ugh, my legs are tired," I said. They weren't <em>that</em> tired, but I was itching to say something.

"Should I slow down?"

"No, I'll be fine." I sped up a little, because screw that. "Seriously though, I'm supposed to be the athletic one, what happened? First you beat me at wrestling, now you're beating me at walking…"

Yali half-laughed. "Maybe we didn't need to do anything with your emotions. Now I can just beat you in a fight."

"Come on, we can't <em>really</em> count that. Ya know, 'cause usually I fight against people I'm willing to <em>hurt</em>."

"What, don't you do play-fighting with your friends?"

"More like with randos in the schoolyard. Like I don't care if they get a few bruises, they'll be fine."

"If <em>I</em> get a few bruises," said Yali irritably, "<em>I'll</em> be fine."

How had that even offended her?! I scrambled to think back to what I'd said. "It's not the same!" I complained. Yali ignored me. "Come on, you're my girlfriend! I'm allowed to be extra protective!"

"I was joking, anyway," she said wearily. "With the powers you'll have as the Blood Child, I wouldn't have a chance against you."

"Way to kill the mood."

We walked on in silence for a while. Finally, Yali muttered that we were getting close, and picked up the pace. It shouldn't have been hard for me to keep up with her, but I kept stumbling over the uneven cobblestones. By the time we got where we were going, my legs really <em>were</em> sore from all the times I had to catch myself after tripping a little.

I'd expected the fountain to have a big jet of water shooting up into the air. But instead, it had thousands of little channels of water, flowing along more stone engravings like the others I'd seen around here. There was a big, shallow basin in the middle of the city square, with a big carved stone sticking up in the middle, and more carvings around the edges. All the little channels of water flowed peacefully into the basin, with hardly even a splash. If it wasn't for the rain putting ripples all over the water's surface, it would probably all be a steady, continuous stream. It'd look like the water wasn't moving at all.

Around the fountain were a few benches made of the same stone. Yali led me to one of them and we sat down together. For a solid piece of rock, it was surprisingly comfortable. Once I was settled in, I held Yali's hand and leaned against her shoulder.

The square was oddly deserted. Even though this was the center of the first ring, it wasn't exactly bustling. A few people walked past without really noticing us. At one point, an elderly couple paused on one of the benches across from us, to observe the fountain, but they moved on before long. Once they were gone, I asked Yali, "What if someone's looking at us when we disappear?" But Yali said they wouldn't notice. She started trying to explain the magic behind it, but I didn't really follow it, so we dropped it.

There weren't any cars either, although I got the sense that people just didn't use cars around here. It would probably be super bumpy on the cobblestones, anyway.

Most of the time, it was just me and Yali, huddled together in the cold rain.

"How are you holding up?" said Yali softly.

"I'm okay."

After a long pause, Yali said, "If you don't mind, I'd like a more detailed answer. Your feelings will soon be our battlefield. The more we know about them, the better."

"Hmm…"

"It's okay if you're scared, or overwhelmed, or…"

"Nah, it's not any of that."

"If you're ever not comfortable sharing, you can just tell me, I'll –"

"Yeah, yeah. Honestly, the main thing I'm feeling right now is that I'm <em>soooo</em> glad we don't have to walk any more." I rubbed my legs. Now that I wasn't using them, they'd decided to get even <em>more</em> sore. "Maybe that sounds kinda stupid, but like… it all doesn't feel real to me, still. All the god stuff. I mean, I know it's real, but it just feels like it's in a movie, like it's happening to someone else, not me, you know…? Stern take it, even my feelings don't feel real."

"I understand."

"You do? It's super weird."

"Yes." She didn't elaborate.

"So…" I said, "How are <em>you</em> holding up?"

Yali laughed slightly, but didn't answer.

And then it was back to waiting again. Even though I was cold, and sore, and impatient to get to the big event, waiting didn't seem so hard for some reason. Something about this place just felt oddly peaceful. Although maybe it shouldn't have been a surprise that it was a nice place for waiting, when it was built to honor the Waiting.

Time passed. The rain slowly drained my body heat. I rested against Yali's body and let my mind tune out.

Yali's voice broke the silence. "It's coming," she said hoarsely, as if it was a huge effort to speak at all. "Look into the fountain and think of me."

It was like I was suddenly jerked awake. Obediently, I looked into the fountain. The stone carvings and rippling water were as pretty as before, although it wasn't really my style. I squeezed Yali's hand, and felt that she was trembling.

It was hard to explain when it began. The sound of the fountain flowing continued unchanged, but somehow it was like a clock ticking down the hours. The water's surface became a rippling sheet of glass. When I looked into the reflections, I thought I glimpsed bits of writing I could barely make out, stone tablets carrying long-forgotten histories, and here and there a shadow of a face. The stones were still the stones of the fountain. The shadow was still the shadow of a rusted signpost. What had changed?

<p><em>Think of me.</em></p>

I tried to turn my head, to get another look over at Yali, but my muscles ignored me. The fountain was everything. The splatter of reflections from the grayish light was pulling me inwards. I thought of my hand, still intertwined with Yali's. <em>Let us both be pulled in the same direction</em>, I begged, not knowing to which god I was praying. The raindrops were a thousand fragments that should have shattered into nothingness long ago. But they fell, they fell, they continued inescapably on their course, amassing into a tunnel that stretched out before me. I was falling into the tunnel, into a bottomless pit that fell down into a void of stars.

The world was gone. Yali was gone. I was submerged in the void, with nothing but the stars in every direction around me.

<p><em>Think of me.</em></p>

I made her face appear among the stars. Her eyes were blazing pinpricks of light. Her hand was a constellation reaching out towards me. She was crowned with cold fire that shone from an eternity away.

I fell for centuries, drifting through nothingness, never getting closer to the stars. Gears the size of galaxies stood motionless, as if the clockwork of the universe had been left unpowered until it slowly ground down to a halt. This great monstrosity watched me with indifference, seeing all that I might do. I was not even a cog in the machine, but a floating speck of dust, that would eventually, a million years later, settle in a corner and be forgotten.

At last, I felt a looming presence, like a giant hand hovering over me. Maybe Yali's, or maybe something else's, I had no way to tell. The hand slowly descended around me, forming a vast and empty enclosure around me, shutting out the stars one by one.

In the emptiness of the hand's embrace, I waited, wondering what would happen next. Until, bit by bit, I somehow became aware that the <em>hand</em> was waiting for <em>me</em>. The void it had created was expectant. I reached out, not knowing how. I had no arms to crawl with, no voice to yell into the darkness, no mind to make sense of it with ideas. Yet somehow I still reached out, as if with my life force itself, to scratch a foothold into the fragment of the universe that was being offered to me.

As my life force breached the void, these images all winked away – the hand, the stars, and even the void itself. They left me blinking into a different light that was much closer, much more real and mundane.

I was in another world.
