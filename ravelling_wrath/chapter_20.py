????

If I was going to spend time studying the past, I would need to get comfortable. I manifested a familiar reclining chair and sat down. I wasn't comfortable at first. An old wound bothered me. I shifted my position until it was more tolerable. My leg was cramped. I reclined the chair just right to let the leg relax. The skin on both legs itched where they had gotten warm from walking. I concentrated until the itch subsided.

Finally, my body stopped interrupting my thoughts.

I took out my phone and opened my note-taking app. This was my <em>real</em> phone, so it would come back to the material world with me. Back in the third layer, the Stern God had made me leave it behind, but I had made sure to keep it assimilated to me, so I had gotten it back in the beginning of the next layer. I wanted to remember this, and I wasn't sure if I was going to keep any of the former Farseers' memories after I was brought back to the material world.
 I would <em>probably</em> still have my own memories of <em>remembering</em> the other memories, but I preferred not to rely on that if I didn't have to.

The sun was glaring in my eyes. I had chosen an indoor spot to rest, but the sun shone through a window, and the reflection on the far wall was too bright. I manifested a folding divider wall between me and the reflection, but even the ambient light in the room was glaring in my eyes. I manifested a sleep mask to completely shut out the light. Somehow, even that didn't make it better. Belatedly, I realized what was really happening. It wasn't the physical light that was bothering me. It was the Blood God's presence. I wouldn't be able to shut <em>that</em> out. And given what I was about to do, I wouldn't even want to. It would be better if I could be aware of it, even if it was a strain. So I unmanifested the mask and wall. Instead of shutting out the bright light, I stared into it. I waited until every part of me stopped seeing it as a source of pain, and started seeing it as a point of reference.

And then, I began my task. I began to dig up the memories.


If I wanted to know more about the Blood Temple, I would have to search among my memories for what I might know and what I didn't. I stared into the light, searching my mind for any memories related to the Blood Temple. It was like something just on the edge of my mind, something I couldn't quite remember. The only memories that popped into my mind were subtly unrelated. Why couldn't I think of it? Clearly, many of the former Farseers had lived in a time when the Blood Temple was still active. Did I have memories from those years? I did. Did I have memories from Farseers who lived in the fifth layer of the city? I did. The main Blood Temple building would have been at the main square of the fifth layer. I had seen a picture of it, in an old book I had found in a back room of the Stern monastery. Could I picture a memory of that temple?

Slowly, an image formed into place. The wide front gateway, with the Burning Heart emblazoned at the top of its arch. Echoes of the deep pounding of its drums on its festival days. Flickering images of crowds gathered in celebration or rage.

Somehow, the Waiting God was making things more difficult. It wasn't actively resisting me, but perhaps it had modified the structure of these memories before it even gave them to me. Memories of the Blood Temple had not been <em>removed</em> – I could still remember them if I thought of them – but it was harder than usual to think of them. <em>Other</em> memories had a tendency to come to mind whenever they were relevant, like if I thought of something related. But these memories didn't. They only came when I looked for them specifically.

Something about this made me hesitate. If the Waiting God didn't want me to see these memories, why wouldn't it remove them entirely, the way it had entirely left out the two early Farseers who had murdered Blood Children on purpose? But on second thought, it made sense. Its highest priority would have been to keep me from noticing that anything was out of the ordinary. Missing memories could have created inconsistencies that I could notice. But just <em>not thinking of something</em> wouldn't raise any suspicion. And it was just like the Waiting God to do things this way, to use the smallest intervention necessary to accomplish its goals. Guidance rather than force.

I kept searching. It was a good thing that Rinn and I had made that list of all the Farseers, so that I could just go through the list and not worry that I might forget someone. Everyone knew <em>about</em> the Blood Temple, but many of the Farseers had only known about it from a distance. A few were more promising. I remembered being a farmer coming through this gateway to pray for the health of my livestock, and librarian coming to attend the funeral of a priest. And two of me stood out even more. One of me hated the memory of this gateway, a lawyer who had come to argue a case in Blood court. And another one saw this gateway as the way home, having worked for decades as a caretaker in this very temple.

Now I had some places to start. Next, I would have to decide who to focus on first. What was I really looking for here? I was looking for the truth about the Blood Temple, but what part of the truth? Was I looking for a Blood priest who knew how I could connect to my emotions? Was that the most important thing I could learn? If I thought about it… the most important thing was… I needed to find points where I fundamentally disagreed with the Waiting God. When part of me would become part of the god, I could not be doubtful. I could not be susceptible to seeing things in the way it did. The most Waiting part of myself would have to be utterly confident in rejecting its plan. And right now, it wasn't. I hated the god and its plan, but the god wouldn't take the part of me that hated it. It would take the part of me that saw everything from a distance, the part that coldly picked out the truth without caring how much it hurt. It was a part of me that <em>wouldn't</em> care if I had to suffer and die, and Rinn had to suffer and die, and hundreds of people had to suffer and die, if I had a goal that required it. And if the Waiting saw the destruction of the Blood God as a goal worthy of that… could I truly say that that part of me could never be convinced? I could not. And so I needed an answer on the level of the cold truth. A reason that the Blood God's destruction could never be my goal.

If I was looking for something I would find abhorrent… That gave me an obvious place to look:

<em>How did the Blood Temple fall?</em>

<bigbreak>

It was finally happening. The demolition had begun.

It was hard to see it in the grainy black-and-white of the television. I would have liked to be there to see that wretched structure destroyed with my own eyes. But even though Blood worship was illegal now, there were too many people who refused to give it up, and an event like this could provoke them into a riot. It would not do to spoil my retirement by getting caught in the violence. It was enough to know that it was happening.

I lay back in my bed as I watched the gateway crumble, clouds of white dust spreading into the air. Then the camera turned, giving a view of the milling crowd just as a few Blood supporters rushed out towards the police barricade. In moments, they were writhing on the ground – the Stern police had released a sorcery against them. I smiled. I was not a cruel man, but those fools had brought this on themselves.

I should never have taken that wretched case. But at least they were finally getting what they deserved.

This was perfect, watching it all from the safety and comfort of my own bed. Even better that Eva was out of town, visiting a friend to "decompress". Probably to vent about me. But, at the very least, it meant that she wasn't here to nag me about wearing shoes in the bed. My shoes were <em>not</em> dirty. She never complained of a dirty bed when she didn't <em>see</em> me wearing them, so it was just another of her irrational –

As Yali, I pulled myself out of the memory. Many of the Farseers were tiresome to work with, and this one – Garthold Brannet, the lawyer – was one of them. If I just let his memories go wherever they felt like, I would spend far too much time in his complaints about his wife. There was nothing wrong with his wife. She was an ordinary person with ordinary flaws, and I had no interest in his frustrations with her. But I had to work past them, because he had much more important things to remember.

He had thought of a <em>case</em>. A case he had been involved with as a lawyer, one that was related to the Blood Temple.

It started as an ordinary shoplifting case, which should have been nothing more than a small loss for us. And that was all it would have been, if Mr. Tully, my boss at ????Corporation, hadn't insisted on micromanaging me. And then he had the nerve to blame <em>me</em> for what happened! I could still hear his voice ringing in my years from when he fired me – "I told you to get them arrested, not to bring all of this politics down on us! I will personally make sure you never work in this industry again!" And that shrill Blood Temple judge – "Did you learn Blood law from a book? You subvert the meaning of justice!" Curse them all.

I should have known from the beginning that Mr. Tully was bad news. He had been the new CEO at ????Corporation for just two months, whileI had worked at ????Corporation for twenty years, but he insisted on lording his position over me. He hated me because I was professional where he was crass. He made me report to him on every little detail of every case – like that one.

I was in his sweltering office on the fourth floor, showing him the files for six recent cases of shoplifting at ????Corporation storefronts. The <em>old</em> CEO would have trusted me to do my job – trusted that these were routine cases that didn't need his attention – but not Tully.

"Another six gone to Blood? What do we pay you for, Brannet?!" he yelled, slamming his hand down on the files, spittle flying from his mouth.

I <em>could</em> have yelled back. But <em>I</em> chose to be professional. "Sir, there was nothing that could be done. I challenged them before the Concord of Temples as you asked, but the precedent is unambiguous. The fourth layer is shared between the temples, and whenever a crime is –"

"I don't care about the details! Make something –"

I was <em>about</em> to say that whenever a crime is committed in the fourth layer, the Concord of Temples assigns it to whichever temple is considered to have the greatest interest in the outcome. In these six cases, the defendants were <em>residents</em> of the fifth layer, which meant the Blood Temple was considered to have the greatest interest. If he had <em>listened</em> to me, he would have understood that.

"– Make something happen! Fight it out in Blood court if you have to! That's an order!"

"Sir, I am not an expert in Blood law," I said. That was right, I had <em>told</em> him it wasn't my expertise! I had done <em>my</em> job perfectly, I had warned him, so the whole debacle was <em>his</em> fault for ignoring my advice! I had even said "and so if you ask me to do this, I won't be able to guarantee that the results will be favorable –"

As Yali, I typed out, <em>Brannet didn't understand blood law, <strong>believes</strong> he warned boss</em>. This memory was full of the feeling of looking back and feeling justified. But it couldn't have contained that feeling originally, and he wasn't still alive to add his own thoughts about it now. So the memory had already been rewritten to add it, while he was still alive. He had probably rewritten this memory many times, to cast himself in the best possible light.

Now that I thought about it, it was strange that the memories included so many exact words at all. <em>I</em> certainly couldn't remember full conversations this well, and I was known for having a very good memory. Maybe the Waiting God had somehow enhanced them when it gave them to me. Would that make them more accurate or less accurate? It was hard to figure out.

I didn't like having to try to guess which parts were the truth. Maybe there would be other memories that were less unreliable. I skipped forward to what came next.

It was irritating to be working at Mr. Tully's "orders". He couldn't <em>order</em> me – he was an administrator, not a drill sergeant. But I couldn't talk back to him – that would be unprofessional. So here I was at the Stern library, poring over my books, sitting at a cramped desk under the tall shelves.

I didn't even want to be handling <em>these</em> cases – they were beneath my dignity. But we needed something to justify it to the Waiting. Years ago, I had been "promoted" into a different job title so that ????Corporation could take advantage of a new subsidy from the Waiting Temple, a subsidy for legal services that "contribute to maintaining the order of the city". So now, a certain percentage of my caseload each year was required to fall within the Waiting rules. Having me work on routine shoplifting cases like these was an easy way to qualify, even if it was less valuable to the company.

<em>Anyone</em> in my position would have rankled at being seen as <em>less valuable to the company</em>, especially in front of Mr. Tully. I would <em>show</em> him how valuable I could be, I thought. I would take the cases to Blood court and win. And then he wouldn't underestimate me again.

So, when I sat down with my books to study Blood law, I was determined to find something that others had missed.

I read from the Book of Blood, of course, but I also had to cross-reference it with other legal analyses and historical accounts. The Book of Blood was the most authoritative source, but for every place where it gave a clear definition of the law, there were fifteen places where it appealed to vague principles. It even said that the law wasn't defined by the Book at all, that the true law was defined by the "blood of the people", whatever that meant. Other books gave me a clearer picture. By studying the details of historical legal proceedings over the last hundred years of the Blood Temple, I began to understand the traditions and precedent that governed their decision-making. In that sense, they weren't so different from the Stern Temple after all.

Unfortunately, everything I read confirmed what I already knew: It would be almost impossible to get these crimes prosecuted in Blood court. First of all, every case had to begin with an accusation of a <em>violation of blood</em>. That typically meant an attack against someone's physical body. There were exceptions, of course. A threat could be a violation of blood. Even an insult could be one, if it was degrading enough. And of particular interest to me, property crimes <em>could</em> be violations of blood. Unfortunately, the Blood concept of property was very different from the Stern concept. In Blood law, ownership of items was determined by who <em>touched</em> and <em>used</em> the items in their day-to-day lives. You couldn't own an object you had never seen or touched. And the only people who had handled the goods before they were stolen were local employees.

Could the thefts be prosecuted as thefts <em>from the employees</em>? No… historical negotiations between the temples gave clear precedent against that. The Blood Temple had agreed that whenever the Stern Temple classified goods as the assets of a corporation, it would <em>not</em> consider the employees their owners. Worse, this rule was a <em>concession</em> to be Stern Temple, because otherwise the employees <em>would</em> become Blood owners by virtue of being the only ones to handle the goods with their bodies, and then the Blood Temple would have to defend the employees' right to simply walk off with the merchandise. So, as a compromise, the Blood Temple considered corporate assets to be <em>unowned</em>. And therefore, the Blood Temple could tolerate the Stern Temple prosecuting thefts, but the thefts could never be violations of blood. And if there was no violation of blood, there was no crime.

At least this kind of nonsense still had clear rules. It wasn't so different from Stern law, full of impossible situations created by historical compromises, from which it was my job to find ways out.

But there was worse. Even once there was a <em>violation of blood</em>, it still wasn't necessarily a crime. Or, to be precise, it wasn't necessarily <em>lowari</em>. Blood law described four types of violation – <em>????</em>, <em>????</em>, <em>chet</em>, and <em>lowari</em>. And the Temple would only punish <em>lowari</em>, even though the distinctions between the types were subtle and subjective.

The lowest type of violation was <em>????</em>, a mistake. It was for when the violator didn't understand that someone would be hurt by their actions at all. The Blood Temple answered cases of <em>????</em> by educating the violator, and no other punishment. The violator was encouraged to pay restitution, depending on the circumstances, but not required to. Violations committed by younger children were generally considered <em>????</em>, even if they were intentional, because it was assumed that children didn't understand the impact they were having on others.

Next was <em>????</em>, a crime of desperation. If you were starving and broke into someone's house to steal food, or if you were being abused and you killed your abuser, that was <em>????</em>. When a case of <em>????</em> came before Blood court, it was considered a failure <em>by the Blood Temple itself</em>, because the Blood Temple was responsible for making sure no one fell into desperation. It even triggered internal Blood Temple procedures to investigate how their services had failed the violator. That was interesting, but not helpful to me.

Third was <em>chet</em>, a crime of passion. This was the category generally used when an argument between peers turned violent. It also covered giving in to selfish temptations, such as stealing things that were left in public without knowing who the victim was. The Blood Temple's approach to these situations was to talk to the violator, to it encourage them to understand what they did wrong, apologize, and try to make amends. But even if they refused to apologize, the Blood Temple only considered that an unfortunate situation, not something where the Temple needed to intervene further.

And finally… there was <em>lowari</em>.

Blood law defined <em>lowari</em> as violations that <em>put one person above another</em>. That could be interpreted in many different ways. The archetypal example was forcing someone to be obedient to you, or abusing a position of authority to take advantage of someone. But it also covered small things, like publicly showing contempt for someone else's accent. Assaulting someone for your own <em>amusement</em> was generally <em>lowari</em>, because it made someone's figurative blood subordinate to your whims, but assaulting someone out of irrational anger was only <em>chet</em> – unless you were in a position of power over them, in which case it was <em>lowari</em> again. And rape was always <em>lowari</em>, even in the context of marriage – <em>especially</em> in the context of marriage, because intimate relationships were sacred to the Blood God, so coercion within a relationship was seen as violating a sacred space.

But how did the Blood Temple decide what was what? The distinction between <em>chet</em> and <em>lowari</em> often centered around the feelings that motivated the violator, but how could the Temple judge what someone was feeling? According to the Book of Blood, if the parties couldn't come to a resolution between themselves, the victims and the accused would meet in temple and "bare their hearts", and then "the blood of the city" would decide the truth. From what I could tell, this was nothing but a fancy way of saying that one of the Blood Temple's masked judges would question them and then make an arbitrary decision.

Once it was determined that someone had committed <em>lowari</em>, it was time for the revenge. Officially, the revenge was supposed to be carried out by the victim, although in cases that went to court, Blood Temple staff were happy to "assist" with the revenge, and the victim only needed to nod along. But victims of <em>lowari</em> were explicitly permitted to get revenge without ever going to Blood court – even encouraged to. "When you have been wounded, your blood cries out to be avenged!" said the Book of Blood. "Do not rush blindly into judgment, but do not let anyone push you into easy forgiveness. Do not make yourself quiet!" And theoretically, if the original violator tried to take the victim to court for the revenge, the Blood Temple would classify the revenge as <em>not a violation at all</em>. The principle was that when someone committed <em>lowari</em>, they put themselves above someone else, which formed a wound in their social relationships that could not be healed until they were torn down again. So tearing them down wasn't a violation, it was an act of restoring the balance. Of course, if they <em>hadn't</em> committed <em>lowari</em>, then tearing them down <em>was</em> a violation. Some of the most notorious trials of the last century had been conflicts over who was the original victim, so it clearly wasn't a perfect system.

Getting revenge for <em>chet</em> was permitted, but not encouraged. And if you got revenge for <em>????</em> or <em>????</em>, that was not permitted, and you were probably committing <em>chet</em>. Even if the revenge was unjustified, it was still only <em>chet</em> as long as you <em>believed</em> you had been intentionally violated, but it could be <em>lowari</em> if you were using it to control someone, or if you had lied about feeling violated in the first place.

The victim wasn't the only person who was allowed to get revenge. Anyone in a close relationship with the direct victim could get revenge on their behalf. And if a person committed <em>lowari</em> in front of witnesses, it was also considered a violation against the witnesses. The most extreme abuses of authority could even be considered <em>violations against the city</em>, meaning that anyone in the city had standing to get revenge for them. But that was very rare, and in most cases, you weren't allowed to get revenge unless you were close to the victim or had seen the crime yourself.

I set down my books. I had enough background now to start thinking about strategy.

In order to see any of the shoplifters be punished under Blood law, I would need to produce a victim. And either the victim would need to want revenge, or I would need to produce a second person who was allowed to get revenge on their behalf.

Fortunately, we did have witnesses – that was how the perpetrators had been caught in the first place. And among the witnesses, the ones who had chosen to report the crimes to the Stern might also be amenable to seeking revenge under Blood law. The only question was how to interpret the thefts as <em>lowari</em>.

Two of the six shoplifters had stolen food. I immediately discarded those cases as hopeless – no theft of food had <em>ever</em> been labeled as <em>lowari</em>. But that was fine. Winning even <em>one</em> of these cases would be enough to mark my name down in history. I sorted through the files, until one of them caught my eye, an adolescent girl who had stolen an expensive necklace – oh gods, if only I had never set eyes on that file! If only I had never stepped into the room with that masked judge, never tried to –

A dozen memories were all fighting for my attention. As Yali, I stopped. Before I let them into my mind, there was something I wanted to check. This subsidy from the Waiting Temple… was it part of the Waiting God's plan? I listened for the god, but it was still out of reach. I would have to check again later. For now, I typed up some details about the memories I'd just viewed. Then, I went back to the memory of the trial…

If only there had <em>been</em> a trial. The judge's order at the pretrial hearing left it indefinitely postponed, and then –

I went back to the memory of the pretrial hearing.

The Blood Temple didn't have separate courthouses like the Stern. Legal proceedings were conducted in ordinary meeting halls in the same temples that were used for gatherings and worship. On my way to the hearing, I had to walk across a courtyard where children, probably orphans cared for by the Temple, played noisily in the dirt. I gave them a wide berth – it wouldn't do for my pressed suit to have dirt tossed on it by their rowdiness.

I arrived early, of course. The judge – no, the <em>Speaker</em> – was already in the room, standing ominously in the traditional long red robes and mask that completely covered their face. I couldn't even tell if it was a man or a woman. I had to remind myself that this wasn't Stern court. A Speaker, short for <em>Speaker for the blood of the city</em>, had almost arbitrary power to make legal decisions, and was only accountable to the Blood Temple's Circle of Elders. If I wanted to be successful, this was the person I had to convince.

"Speaker," I greeted, slightly bowing my head. From what I had learned, showing any more deference than that would be seen as groveling. The Speaker nodded back.

Soon, the other parties filtered into the makeshift courtroom. The thief girl didn't look quite how I had imagined her. She came in nervously, holding herself upright, wearing a plain, conservative dress. She was almost pretty. But I could see her piercings, and as soon as she spoke, I could hear the vulgar way she talked. She was clearly fifth-layer trash. No doubt this was her <em>only</em> conservative dress, and she paraded around the streets in straps that barely covered up those oversized breasts – not that I paid attention to that. <em>I</em> was a professional, after all. When she entered, I shook her hand firmly, looking her steadily in the eye while <em>she</em> shied away, and gave a polite –

I pulled myself out of the memory. I didn't care about this hearing – no, I did care about it, but I needed a break from this man. It wasn't even the sexual thoughts that bothered me. I had gotten used to the memories thinking sexual thoughts at inappropriate times, since it was common across almost all the Farseers, including myself. But Brannet's hypocrisy – thinking degrading things, then congratulating himself for being a better person – it was getting into my head in a way I didn't like at all. I could get back to this hearing <em>later</em>. Maybe it would be easier if I viewed Brannet's memories in short bursts.

But since I'd pulled myself out so suddenly, I wasn't organized on what else to do. I didn't want to feel like I was wasting time. I needed to keep going – no, there <em>was</em> something else I could do. I still had another Farseer to investigate – Hiram Soleocchi, the one who'd been a Blood Temple caretaker.

What did he know that I was looking for?

His memories were organized much differently. They flowed from thought to thought, rather than being logically organized like Brannet's. I knew he knew <em>some</em> things about how the Blood Temple fell, but it was hard to make them come to mind when they hadn't already come to mind. And I was tired of fighting with the memories. To give myself a break, I decided to just let them flow. To see where they would go when I thought back to the Blood Temple in general.

<bigbreak>

Apparently, time has seen me become "the cool substitute teacher". I have always been told I have a way with children, and it would have made me happy if my stories of the old Blood Temple were what earned me that title. Happier still if it were the way I patiently listened to <em>their</em> stories of their lives. But it was something much simpler than that. It made me sad. In all their other classes, these kids were being told to keep their heads down and study. All I had to do to be "cool" was to give them a break from that. A chance to relax and move their bodies.

I was in the middle school today, covering for a math class. I had told the kids they could rearrange the desks, and a bunch of them had made a circle to play a game with each other. The others had found their own little pursuits. Noki, who'd just turned fourteen, was sitting on the windowsill and staring out the window – it was a beautiful day outside. No kind of day to keep these kids indoors studying math.

Principal Cossaman would have wanted me to keep them "on task", but it never seemed right to enforce the Stern rules on them. Nowadays, half of their parents were away in the factories from dawn to dusk, and came home too tired to spend time with their children. Who could blame the kids for wanting more space, more affection? The Stern tell us that things are better than ever, because of all this "progress". Because the parents are away building all the newest automobiles and personal computers and whatever other great inventions the Seeking have dreamed up. And in a way, it is true. When I was young, a car was a luxury for the rich, and now it seems like even the poorest families have them. But are they happy? Are people happier now? I can't help but wonder if we could have gone a different way. If we could have had all these marvelous inventions, but also had our children be happy.

"Hey, old man!" one of them piped up. "Mister Soleocchi, are you listening?"

I blinked, bringing myself back to the present, where a few of the kids were gathered around me, eagerly asking me questions. "Ah, call me Hiram. Did I doze off there?"

One of them leaned forward. "Mister Hiram, is it true that Blood temples had giant orgies every year?"

I smiled wistfully. Nowadays, kids only wanted to hear the gory details, about the orgies, the floggings. I suppose that kids have always asked about these things, because kids always do what kids do best, hunting after the highs and lows of life until they find their place in the world. But it used to be that there were another kind of questions, too. Ten years ago, there were kids who asked questions like "why aren't we allowed to say the Blood prayers anymore?" and "my granddad says the Blood Temple always sent someone around to take care of his mother when she was having one of her episodes, so Granddad could still go to school. Why don't the Stern do that?" But for kids growing up today, the Blood Temple was just a part of history.

And what did I tell them? Yes, there were holy days when we hosted orgies. Yes, criminals who severely exploited people were sometimes stripped of their clothing and flogged in the public square. But that wasn't what the Blood Temple was really about. And no, I couldn't tell them any stories about the floggings, because Blood tradition forbade gossiping about someone's past punishment. No, I wouldn't disregard Blood tradition just because the Blood Temple was gone now. There were reasons for how we did things. After someone was punished, they needed to be given the chance to return to equal status in society. If you treated their humiliation as a funny thing to gossip about, you were stepping on them for your own amusement. That was <em>lowari</em>.

No… none of that was what the Blood Temple was really about.

What a pity that most of these kids would have to grow much older before they would appreciate my fond memories of the hard work, the satisfying work of Blood. As I often did, I made a compromise, telling the hectic story of our work during the relief effort for Hurricane Fjarl –

No… as Yali, I didn't have to compromise with what those kids from the past were interested in. Now that I had touched the thought of <em>what the Blood Temple was really about</em> within Hiram's memories, I could skip straight there. It would be perfect – if I understood the true purpose of the Blood Temple, that would be something I could use against the Waiting God.

It was a time of peace, a slow autumn when the days were warm and the temple well-stocked, years before the hurricane put us in the middle of recovery again. It had been a good year for the eastern farmland, and the harvest festival had been more lively than ever, with bonfires and feasting filling the streets as far as the eye could see. A simpler time, when I could sit with the temple children all around me and read to them from the Book of Blood. I was no priest, but I still looked forward to whenever I could read the words aloud, lovingly thumbing through the worn pages of my old copy. The Book of Blood was the only holy book that published new versions on a yearly basis, to reflect the living truth of the people's will. But for me, I always kept the copy that my grandfather had read to me as I sat on his knee. "Each one of you has a fire inside you," I would always read. "A fire of your pride… A fire of your strength… A fire that is always burning. Always be sure to feed that fire, to grow strong in a way that is all your own. And be sure to feed the fires of those around you, because what makes any of us strong makes all of us strong. No person is above or below any other." On the best days, there was time for everyone to listen together, from the smallest children to the most wizened elders, because everyone needed the words in their own way.

In the time like that, little of our work was so urgent that it couldn't be interrupted. One day, while I was loading the kids' dirty clothing into the newfangled electric washing machine, little ???? approached me, tugging at my pant leg and croaking out that his throat was hurting. The poor thing – the temple was a hub of activity, so it was all too easy for diseases to spread. I had been keeping ahead on the laundry, so it could wait for another day.

???? had a bad cold, but at least it was only a cold. I took his hand and found us a quiet room. I helped him get wrapped up in a blanket, then mixed some honey water to help soothe his throat.

"It'll be okay," I said softly. "Hiram will take care of you. You'll be all better before you know it."

I loved all of the children here, from the youngest toddlers to the older teens who were growing into their power. From the orphans, to the ones who stayed at the temple during the day while their parents were away working, to the ones who just loved to play at the temple, to the ones who just showed up one day without saying why. But I especially loved the ones who were struggling, the ones who were clumsy and sad and didn't know how to put their feelings into words. Those were the ones who needed the Blood Temple most of all.

Of course, I didn't love them <em>every</em> day. It's hard to love anyone when you've been awake for twenty hours cleaning up after the incredible variety of messes they know how to make. But caretaking isn't a feeling – it's a habit. Civeah, one of the other caretakers, sometimes said she loved the children every day, but on other days, she said she hated them every day. Maybe I just wasn't as Blood as she was. Or maybe we were both Blood, but I was also Waiting enough to remember how I would feel on other days, not just how I felt at the moment.

That day was one of those days. ???? kept holding onto me and wouldn't let go, so I had to stay up all night and keep soothing him. To keep him entertained, I lugged in the radio and tried to tune in to a good program. This late at night, there weren't many to choose from. Most of the city's radio stations were in the upper layers, and the magic in the city walls meant that radio signals couldn't get from one layer to another. Among what was left, I still had to skip past most of them – too many of these radio comedies were based on degrading people, and it just wasn't right for kids to grow up thinking that was the way to be funny. In the end, I found one about a family where the characters made comical mistakes, but ultimately still loved each other. Before long, ???? was laughing along, in between his occasional coughing. I kept sitting with him, gently rubbing his back, until the morning light had come and he had finally managed to drift off to sleep.

Once he was fast asleep, I neatened up the blankets and –

I pulled myself out of the memory. As Yali, I had thought this would be something important, but the more I looked, the more it seemed like it was just feel-good stuff. It was just Hiram looking back on something with rose-colored glasses. And the overall decision-making wasn't even <em>good</em>! If you weren't having a crisis, that didn't mean you could afford to idle around, it meant you could afford to prepare for the next crisis before it happened.

In hindsight, it hasn't been very likely that the things <em>he</em> thought were the most important would be the same things <em>I</em> thought was the most important. I would have to hunt through the memories myself, like I always did. Maybe the right idea was to go over the story of Hurricane Fjarl after all. That would tell me the real measure of the Blood Temple – the way it handled a crisis.

By the whim of the Seeking, the main temple didn't get the worst of the storm. The power was out all across the city, and we got a lot of rain, but that was all. But a lot of our smaller temples had been hit hard, a lot harder than we had prepared for, and they needed immediate help so they could keep serving their people.

We called in all the temple's part-time workers, and had a big planning meeting in the main hall. People kept rushing in and out, and everyone wanted to talk at once, and we had a big map of the city on the wall, where we put a red mark for every place that needed more workers or more food or more supplies, and from the back of the room they blended together into a giant red scrape across half the city. In the first hour of the meeting we agreed to send everyone we could possibly spare to help our other temples. By the time the meeting ended at sunset, we had agreed to send even more, because the others could spare it even less.

I was one of the few who stayed behind. I had always been overwhelmed by new places, so if anyone was going to stay, it might as well have been me. There were only five of us left – me, Civeah, Hasofel, Barlim, and the old priest, Rohin – and overnight, we had to turn the temple into a staging area for all the supplies that were coming through. There was no one left to make the rounds in the neighborhood, to check on the elders and disabled people who lived close to the temple. It was a tragedy, knowing that they might need us now more than ever. But us five had enough work for twenty people in front of us, and it was vital to the lives of so many more.

I called all the children together and told them that today was an important day for all of us, and I needed to trust them to take care of each other while we caretakers worked for the hurricane relief. Jae-nyu and Quercy volunteered to help, and I brought them outdoors with me, quickly looking for work that was safe for them to do. I knew that it would take a lot of my attention to manage them, maybe more than the extra pairs of hands would gain us, but we were a community, and a community works together.

We hauled out almost everything from the temple storerooms. Everything that could survive the rain went into stacks in the temple courtyard, to make room for the truckloads of equipment that other workers were bringing from further inland. We were never ready. At one point, there were three trucks waiting to be unloaded at once, at the same time as a local family was trying to give us a cartload of donations and a messenger from the Stern Temple was trying to coordinate with us.

"We can't accept this food! Nonperishables only!" Civeah was yelling, waving her arms to try to get the point across through the noise of the rain.

Rohin briefly looked away from his quiet but heated conversation with the Stern messenger. As he turned, a gust of wind caught the red robe he was wearing, blowing part of the hood into his face. Barlim had teased him for still wearing the robes of a priest while it was pouring, but he was proud to be a priest, and he refused to be seen without them. You couldn't take away someone's pride.

Holding his hood open with his hand, Rohin said, "I think, perhaps, we can? We can't send it onwards, but our own larder is nearly emptied. It is, perhaps, the way the least would go to waste –"

That was true. A few years before, we had installed an electric refrigeration unit for the temple larder, which of course wasn't working now. But Hasofel had had the foresight to keep it stocked with ice anyway, praise the Waiting. So now it was one of the few places that could still keep food cold.

"Who's gonna move it all?" Civeah yelled back, gesturing at the three trucks we still had to unload.

"We'll take care of it," said one of the donors gruffly. "We're all in the same temple."

"Your devotion –" Rohin held onto his hood. "Your devotion sustains us all. Hiram, do you have time to show them –"

As soon as Rohin looked towards me, I knew I'd be stuck with showing them to the larder. Everyone understood that Rohin was in charge around here. That wasn't how the Blood Temple was <em>supposed</em> to work – tradition said that Blood priests should only offer education and advice, and let the listeners make their own decisions. But Rohin had a way of giving advice that didn't really give you a choice. If I didn't do what he suggested, he would keep saying "Ah, but perhaps you haven't considered –" until I gave in. In theory, the Blood Temple had rules that could stop this kind of thing – if someone raised the issue before the Circle of Elders, the elders would investigate, and they would certainly find that he had too much power to be an ordinary priest. Then he would either be exiled or promoted to a Speaker. Since he was widely respected, he would probably be made a Speaker, which meant he <em>would</em> have official authority, but would have to wear the mask all the time and wouldn't be allowed to give himself an identity separate from the other Speakers. But in practice, none of that would happen – Rohin was likable enough, and no one was angry enough to get the Circle involved, and Rohin was smart enough not to do anything that would change that. Only Civeah still bothered to argue with him, and she usually ended up doing what he said anyway.

So I showed the family to the larder. We had already worked all night, the dim light of morning was rising, and I couldn't wait for my turn to sleep, but I carried on. In minutes, we were a whole train of people carrying food items from the cart to the larder, people of all different sizes, me and Jae-nyu and ????q and the whole family who was donating it. I led them down into the cold larder and tried to show them how it was organized, but of course, it was hopeless – everyone stacked what they were carrying on whatever shelves they could reach. It was already so late, I was too sleepy to keep track of them all. Even so, I kept a close eye on where everything was getting put, because Waiting knew someone would be confused later.

While I was watching, I heard Jae-nyu scream from outdoors. I ran back up the stairs, almost stumbling from my fatigue. Out in the rain, I found Jae-nyu sitting in the dirt, next to a heap of broken glass. She had gotten tired while carrying a heavy juice bottle, and put it down to take a break, but she had put it on a stack of tarps that wasn't stable, and then it had slid off and hit her in the leg before it fell and shattered. She pulled down her pants to show me her bruise.

"That looks painful," I said gently. In my head, I continued, <em>but not bad enough that I can afford to stay away from my other duties</em>. I knelt down next to her, feeling the strain of wanting to help when I knew I had to keep it quick. "Would you like to head inside and rest? Remember, it's always okay to –"

"No!" she said loudly.

Sometimes, kids could be such a headache. If Jae-nyu kept working when she was this tired, she was going to hurt herself again. But that was her pride, and it was better to let her get hurt than to ask her to give up her pride. Eventually, she would learn her limits, and until then, it was my job to support her as best I could. "I know you can be strong," I said. "Keep being strong, but remember to be careful –"

"Hiram, there you are! We could really use an extra body over here –"

I looked up. Civeah and the others were straining to lift a pallet of portable generators out of a truck. They really did need help. Reluctantly, I started to stand. I patted Jae-nyu on the shoulder. "I'm sorry, but it looks like I'm needed. Jae, if you're okay to keep working, I'm appointing you as guardian of this broken glass. Don't touch it, but make sure nobody steps on it until someone can help you clean it up."

Jae-nyu nodded resolutely. I stood and hurried towards the others, fighting the feeling that I was leaving something unfinished. An emergency was a difficult time. If only we lived in a world where there was always enough time to take care of everyone who was hurt. It had almost seemed like we did, back in that one autumn, when I had been able to spend a whole night to take care of…

That was… The same memory of the sick boy from earlier. As Yali, something was bothering me. This wasn't <em>just</em> a fond memory of old times. Hiram actually felt like he had accomplished something then, and he was frustrated that it wouldn't get done now. But what was he thinking of? Staying up with the boy all night didn't solve anything! What about the next time the boy was sick, when Hiram might not be there? Someday, the boy would have to learn how to handle it on his own, and until then, this was just delaying the inevitable. But Hiram felt like this was a beautiful success, a <em>holy</em> thing. What was so successful about it? I couldn't tell. This was frustrating. It was even worse than when I was trying to understand the Waiting God – with the god, I could at least <em>ask</em> what it thought about something, and then I could form new god-thoughts to get my answer. But with the memories, I just had to hope there was already a memory that explained it.

There might be some way I could figure it out, but I wasn't getting anywhere right now. I thought back to the hurricane. The first memory that came up was the beginning again, the big meeting where everyone was arguing about where to send help first. I was about to skip forward to a different memory when I noticed an old man who looked oddly familiar. Not familiar to Hiram, but to me, Yali. But how could someone from eighty years ago look familiar? Unless – wait! It was familiar from <em>Waiting God's</em> past, not mine. The man was dressed the same way as that group I had seen negotiating with the businesspeople. Who were they? Hiram's memory thought of them as important people who deserved a lot of respect… people you'd see working with the Blood Temple, but not exactly Blood Temple leaders, either. I thought back, trying to find other memories of them.

It was a long time before, when I was just a few years out of school, the year my grandfather passed. I hadn't gotten used to my role at the Blood Temple yet, and I was nervous around all the important priests and community leaders who came by. That was how I met her – I was moving a cart of firewood down the hallway, to restock the beacon fires on the temple towers, when a proud, dignified old woman approached from the other direction. I hurried to move my cart to the wall so she would have plenty of room to pass.

She looked at me sharply. "You there! Young man. Why did you move aside?"

The lines of her face spoke of someone who did not smile easily. I fumbled for my words. "I – you – you're from the neighborhood council in ????, right? You must have important business, I'm nobody important –"

The old woman gestured at my cart. "You are doing the work of the Temple, aren't you? That cart must be very heavy – heavier than me, that's certain. In this hallway, you are the important one." She pointedly moved herself to the opposite wall.

"I – uh, thanks, I'll just –" In hindsight, I appreciated her show of respect. At the time, I shut my mouth and hurried on my way, not sure how to handle the situation.

But in the coming months, she made a point of noticing me, pausing on her way to thank me for my work, asking after how the Blood Temple was treating me. And in return, I heard her own news about her work on the neighborhood council. It sounded like a constant struggle, making sure everyone in ????neighborhood was advocated for, despite their many conflicting needs and perspectives.

"These ????Company hustlers are still trying to get our permission to build one of their radio stations in ????neighborhood. We told them that if the towers would be built in the middle of ????neighborhood, and if their broadcasts would become part of the culture of ????neighborhood, then the towers would be owned by the people, and the people would decide what was broadcast. They laughed at us! When will they give up?"

"I don't understand," I said. "If they laugh at you in your own home, how do they expect to make you agree to anything?"

"They have nothing new to offer. But they are <em>persistent</em>…" she scoffed. "They want us to think of how wonderful it would be that they will bring jobs, that they will hire [???? people from ????neighborhood]. So their offer is that we will do the work for them, then they will own the result? What rubbish! But some of the weaker wits on my council are halfway persuaded by it. Young man, I fear for my grandchildren's generation… Just this morning little ????name asked me, 'why can't we have good radio like the upper layers?' Where did she even hear that the upper layers have good radio? I would hardly call it <em>good</em>, I have heard their programs, they are full of liars trying to sell you things you don't need. I told her, we <em>could</em> have good radio, but those greedy men will not let us have it unless they can use it to control us. We are a proud neighborhood, we will not be turned into working dogs for some distant company!"

I didn't feel like I had a complete grasp of the issue, but she certainly made it sound important. "I'm glad you're out there protecting us," I said.

"For what good it'll do…" she muttered. "No doubt they will find some other neighborhood who will be suckered into believing this… horsecrap. And then we will all be listening to radios telling us to buy, buy, buy."

"Surely the Blood Temple would put a stop to that!"

"The Blood Temple is not what it used to be, young man. The Circle have made one too many treaties for my liking, and now they are too wrapped up in their internal politics to see how the world is changing around them. When I was your age, they would have come down hard on something like this, but too many things have changed…" She shook her head. "No, don't let me demoralize you. Maybe the Blood Temple isn't what it used to be, but you are part of its next generation. You can make it whole again."

"Me? I'm just a caretaker…"

She fixed me with a steely glare. "Caretakers are the beating heart of the city, and don't you forget it!"

Hiram felt encouraged when he heard that. As Yali, it was bittersweet. Unfortunately, the Blood Temple had fallen before Hiram had been able to live a full life as part of it… Unfortunately? When had I started unconsciously taking the side of the Blood Temple? True, that was what I <em>wanted</em> to happen, but I had been expecting to make a conscious choice. Not to just have it… sneak in, without my permission.

I still didn't even know the full story about how the Blood Temple fell. Maybe it was time to go back to Brannet. Yes… Hiram had cleared my head, and I could put up with him for a while longer. The case he was on had definitely been related to the fall. I thought back to the pretrial hearing again.

<bigbreak>

Once everyone was present – especially Tanmei Luef, the "victim" I had chosen – the hearing could start. I was there as her advocate. In Blood court, a victim was allowed to designate one or more people as their advocates – which didn't usually mean lawyers, and often meant friends or family. But since there were no qualifications for an advocate, it was a convenient excuse for me to be present.

After the initial formalities, the hearing began with her reading out her accusation, which I had prepared with her in advance. It was a real sob story. She was one of the latest round of layoffs at ????Corporation. Her home was full of mold after it had been damaged in floods during the previous month, and because she had lost her income, she had had to cancel a repair job she had scheduled. Then she had gotten seriously ill from the mold, ended up in the emergency room, and ultimately had to sell her home for a pittance to cover expenses. It was lucky I had found someone with such a clear connection between their loss of income and their physical body. Our argument was that thefts of expensive goods – such as the theft this case centered around – had directly led to the layoffs that caused Tanmei's miserable hardship.

After our presentation, the Speaker finally spoke. Now I could tell that she was a woman. Her voice was curt and dismissive – she must have been prejudiced against me from the start. "Is there a direct connection between your situation and the taking of the specific necklace?"

"In the case of Grem v. Sargon," I interceded, "a gang of young men wantonly destroyed a dozen pumpkins belonging to Farmer Sidi. Sargon Verth, a regular customer of the farmer, saw that there were no pumpkins left for him to buy, and when he heard of what happened, he beat one of the young men bloody. When it was challenged, the blood of the city pronounced his actions as permissible revenge for <em>lowari</em>, on the basis that the young man must have known that his actions were depriving someone of pumpkins, even though there was no proof that the dozen pumpkins would have been sold to Sargon, or even that there would have been any pumpkins left for him to buy if those dozen had not been destroyed. In the same way –"

"I din' know anything!" the thief girl blurted out. She looked like she was about to cry her eyes out. "I din' make it flood, I din' make 'er get sick –"

"You will have your chance to speak later," said the Speaker brusquely. At least there was <em>some</em> sense of decorum here. "So," she continued, "the accusation before the Temple is that Tanmei's blood was dependent on ????Corporation, and that thefts have left ????Corporation no choice but to abandon her. Is that correct?"

I should have known! I should have realized what a disaster I was walking myself into. But I thought I had reasoned it out so well. I simply said, "That is correct."

"Where are the decision-makers?" said the Speaker curtly.

"Beg pardon, Speaker?"

"The decision to terminate Tanmei's employment was made by human beings. It was one or more human beings who considered ????Corporation's budget and, per the accusation, determined that they had no choice but to abandon the blood of one of their own. Let them come before the Temple and testify."

But the reorganization had involved people from four different departments across ????Corporation, up to and including our CEO! If <em>he</em> was called to testify in a routine shoplifting case because of me, I'd be a laughingstock! "Speaker, I appreciate the Temple's interest in having the best possible information, but surely it's not necessary for them to <em>personally</em> –"

"Necessary? If a person has been forced to take part in another's suffering, should they not be <em>eager</em> to see that injustice brought to a resolution?"

"No one at ????Corporation wants to see anyone suffer, I assure you! But surely you don't expect them to take time out their busy schedules just to –"

"Did you learn Blood law from a book?" the Speaker barked. "You subvert the meaning of justice! We DO expect them to testify – an accusation has been made, and their decisions are at the heart of it! Do you think they are so high above Tanmei that they have no need to look her in the face?"

"Then we withdraw the accusation! Don't we, Tanmei –"

"Fool!" the Speaker shrieked. "You cannot quiet her blood! The blood of the city hears your words as an attempt to control her, and by law, the accusation can no longer be withdrawn! You have made it far too clear why you are here. You brought Tanmei here intending to use her suffering as a tool to benefit ????Corporation. But suffering cries out with a voice of its own, and those who were truly responsible must be found! Let every pertinent financial record be brought to the temple, and let everyone involved in the decision come to testify! The blood of the city demands it!"

"????Corporation most certainly won't be complying with such a demand! We are established within the jurisdiction of the Stern Temple, and the Blood Temple has no authority to –"

"So you came here with no intention of respecting our decisions? Begone from this temple, scofflaw! Run and tell your <em>masters</em> to expect our full demands in writing by month's end, and tell them that we will not be used!"

How did it end this way? Curse them all! Curse that Speaker for spiting me! Did she get pleasure out of ruining my career? She must have been –

As Yali, I concentrated, trying to sort out my own thoughts. In Brannet's memories, the Speaker had felt like an unreasonable person, irrational and shrieking. But when I thought about what she had actually said, it made plenty of sense. It was unsettling to think about. But looking back and forth in the memories, it was obvious what had happened. Brannet had taken the Speaker seriously until he knew she was a woman. It wasn't too surprising – I had seen similar things from some of the other male Farseers. Whenever a woman was criticizing him, even the physical sound of her voice was recorded differently. It came out as something much more unpleasant than the way it would be recorded in my memories, or high room's, or most of the other Farseers'.

The contrast didn't feel so unsettling now that I knew it was just Brannet's sexism. I returned to the memories.

I never liked to think back to the time right after the hearing. When Mr. Tully fired me, he scheduled a full hour just to yell at me for bringing the Blood Temple's attention against us. Did he ever apologize for ordering me to do it in the first place? Did I ever get an apology from ????Corporation after it ultimately worked out in their favor? Of course not.

But I did watch the news like a hawk. I had expected the case to fade into obscurity after ????Corporation rejected the Blood Temple's demands… but only the Waiting knows the end. The Blood Temple had no authority to compel testimony from ????Corporation executives, but they did have authority over the fifth layer, where ????Corporation had two storefronts. And they must have been waiting for an excuse to act, because they <em>banned</em> ????Corporation from the fifth layer and seized the two storefronts. ????Corporation appealed to the Stern to protect their assets. And that was where things got complicated.

Back then, it was unprecedented for the Stern police to enter the fifth layer. But the Trade Unification Treaty had changed things, creating a special arrangement to allow corporations to do business across layer boundaries. No doubt, when the Blood Temple signed the treaty, none of them believed they were giving permission for Stern forces to enter their territory. But in a beautiful legal argument, the Stern Temple stated that the Blood Temple's seizure of ????Corporation assets was a <em>violation</em> of the Trade Unification Treaty, and claimed the right to a "minimal enforcement action" to protect the assets.

Soon, the Concord of Temples was inundated with accusations from both sides. And while temple representatives took weeks to debate in the Concord, the situation escalated. The Stern arrested dozens of Blood Temple personnel and held them in Stern temples within the fifth layer, which were technically their own pockets of Stern territory. Blood warriors attacked those temples – another diplomatic violation – to break them out. The Blood side brought priests to the front lines of the fighting, and when those priests were inevitably injured or arrested, they used it as an excuse for further violence. And after the accidental death of a Blood priest in Stern custody, the Blood Temple accused the Concord of stalling and unilaterally declared a state of war between the two temples.

That was their last mistake. Our forces were better-equipped and better-organized, and the Blood forces were crushed in battle after battle. The Blood Temple was able to drag out the war for another four months, but they never had a chance. In the end, their loyalists were scattered and their temples were in ruins. They couldn't even assemble a delegation to send to the Concord, so the Concord voted to formally withdraw recognition. The Concord reassigned the bottom two layers as Stern territory, because the Stern Temple was the only temple prepared to administrate them. Once the Stern had formal authority, they finally began to stamp out the remains of that archaic institution. The remaining Blood temples were either demolished or repurposed to serve unglamorous functions. Companies like ????Corporation, which had been <em>de facto</em> excluded from the fifth layer by their arbitrary, restrictive policies, were free to expand their operations there.

As Yali, I thought this over. How much of this was the Waiting God's plan? What had the Waiting Temple been doing during the conflict?

The Waiting Temple had its own military, but it was hardly ever used. I remembered a statement released by the Waiting Temple, lamenting the violence on both sides, but taking no additional action. Which made sense, because there was no need for the Temple to overextend itself when things were already going in the right direction. It was better to let it resolve itself than to become entangled.

I concentrated. That last thoughts hadn't felt like Brannet's usual opinions. Could it have been the Waiting God again? Yes, it was! And it was merging with my own thoughts the same way as before, so I had been right – it wasn't really conscious of what I was doing. That meant I could examine its thoughts again! Had this all been part of its plan? The Waiting Temple subsidy leading to Brannet getting involved in this case, leading to the fall of the Blood Temple? I held that idea in my mind, trying to express it in the way the god understood things, and listened for the god's conclusions.

It was hardly a grand design. Like so many things, it was a messy sequence of events, set in motion by a soul whose purposes were far askew from our own. It would have been foolish to rely on this particular one of our temple's countless half-formed expressions of our will. But our net was wide and slow, and just as a drought needs only one spark to become a fire, Blood's temple could never have remained stable forever, not when the city's loyalty was turning away from Blood and towards a deeper structure. Things would be messy for this long moment, but they would not be messy forever.

<em>And that was bad,</em> I insisted to myself. The Waiting God's structure was bad.

How disorganized I was being, to protest against something that was unavoidable.

We went back and forth like this for a few minutes. The Waiting God's thoughts felt so true, it was hard to make them doubtful. I shouldn't have rushed into questioning it without getting my own thoughts in order. In the end, I purposefully let myself think impatient thoughts, to get myself out of the mindset of the god. I just wanted something that would let me think about the Blood Temple without putting all this dismissiveness in my head. I switched back to Hiram.



<bigbreak>

I would like to think that I never truly left the Blood Temple. All of my social circles were built around it, and even as my Temple friends brought me grimmer and grimmer news of what was happening in my absence, there was never a moment when I stopped thinking of it as <em>my temple</em>. But the physical temple had become a dangerous place to be. When the Circle of Elders had announced their declaration of war, they had asked for the aid of all who would fight in defense of the Temple, and they had asked those who would not fight to stay at home to protect themselves and their families. And I knew which of those was me.

When the Stern captured our high priest, everyone had a different opinion about who was the legitimate successor. It shouldn't have mattered, because the role of high priest was a formality – no one person can have too much power. But even in the Blood Temple, people have a weakness for hero-worship. It didn't help that the Stern Temple insisted on acknowledging the acting high priest, who wanted to negotiate with the Stern, instead of the one the Circle appointed to replace him. It should have been obvious that the Stern were trying to pit us against each other. But there were fights. Friends accused friends of betrayal. I did what I could to mend feelings, but the temple I had loved was falling apart. I wished I could go back to the time when I could just teach the children how to take care of their bodies, and how to live by the Blood ways. At least then I have been able to feel like the next generations would live better lives than we had.

In the end, I was tired. Too many of my friends had died in the fighting, and too many more had been carried away to the Stern prison when they tried to protest against the new laws. I understood what drove them, but it was not a place I could follow. I had never had the Stern instinct, the instinct to sacrifice everything rather than compromise my principles. Something good had been lost forever, but there had always been loss, and there was no sense in fighting for something that was already gone. My one small act of rebellion was to keep my Book of Blood when the Stern burned all the copies, keeping it hidden under a floorboard and lying to the Stern when they came to take them. Other than that, I adapted. I found small ways to keep the tradition of caretaking alive in the new order.

That was what the Blood Temple had always been about. It was never about all this fighting, all this politics. It was about people caring for each other. It was about helping people grow strong in their knowledge of themselves. And when they were not strong, it was about staying up late into the night to make sure they –

There was the memory of the sick boy again. The same fond memory of staying up all night just to comfort him.

I hesitated. If Hiram kept coming back to this memory, maybe there was something important in at after all. He was a thoughtful person, and even a bit of a cynic. He liked feel-good things, but not <em>this</em> much. So what was it?

This was unsettling. To <em>him</em>, it was so <em>obvious</em> why this would be a good formative experience for the boy. He just wasn't thinking it in a way I could make sense of.

I hunted through the memories, ruthlessly skipping back and forth, searching for an explanation. Memories of him watching over the children, breaking up fights and explaining the value of respect for each other – no, not quite the same thing. Memories of him making the rounds in the community, telling new neighbors about the services the Temple could provide for them and their children – no, too practical. When did he ever think about his reasons? How could he just keep going all the time?

"How do you put up with it?" Civeah slurred.

She was already swaying on her feet. She only ever came to this dingy bar to get drunk out of her mind, and it was always my job to get her home safely, because she wouldn't let anyone else do it. She had already asked me to dance four times, even after we had agreed not to. We both knew she would take it as a romantic gesture, then be heartbroken later.

I didn't have to answer before she went on. "???? broke her doll again, the wooden one I just fixed yesterday! So I fixed it again! Why?! Those little ashhhhholes break everything, they break everything, they break everything they touch. They'll do it forever. What's the point of it all?"

Already knowing how she would answer, I began, "You should take some time for yourself. I'm promise we can cover –"

"Fffuck that," she said, as always. "Just, how do you put up with it? You perfect, you perfect, ahhh –"

I knew she wouldn't remember in the morning, but I did my best. "You fixed something much bigger than a doll," I said. "The children rely on us. And every time they see us being there to support them, they're learning something bigger. It's not just that one time. They're learning that there is someone they can always rely on. That's the real magic of what we do. We're teaching them that this is a world where people can rely on each other. Where we care about each other. And maybe when they're older, when someone else is relying on <em>them</em>, they'll remember, and they'll know what they need to do…" I leaned against a wall, trying not to look at the harsh electric lights. "Ah, I'm sounding like my grandpa, bless his drifting soul…"

I pulled myself out of the memory, a sense of disappointment filling me. This was his reason? It wasn't a reason I could accept. In this world, you couldn't rely on anyone. You had to know how to take care of your own needs. I could feel an emptiness inside me, the sickness, the guilt, of every time I had been been hurt because I carelessly expected someone else to do what I needed without me checking it. Every time I had hesitated because some useless adult had told me things would be taken care of. Teaching kids that they could rely on anyone was just going to get them hurt! They would blunder into danger again and again and again until they were burned enough times to learn not to trust anyone else with their safety! And if the Blood God thought this was holy, the Blood God was letting it happen! It would be responsible for their suffering, for <em>my</em> suffering! I could feel anger building inside me, anger at this man who would try to soothe away the core of what made me strong, what made me <em>Yali Seti</em>. I could just imagine him softly telling me it was okay to let down my guard. I could never let down my guard! If I did, I would be weak and helpless and pathetic, I would be back with the Dalners, I would be sick and no one would take care of me, I wouldn't get up in the morning. How could this be <em>holy</em>?! I could never accept it! How dare the Blood God try to soothe me! How dare it tell me that all my work was meaningless, that everything I had done to protect myself was meaningless?!

But if the Blood God was bad, then the Waiting God was right. To protect humanity from their foolish vulnerability, it was necessary to carve away the remnants of Blood, to clear humanity of the frivolousness that held them back from doing what needed to be done. Then the world could become whole. Humanity could finally free itself from its destructive complications.

No! That was <em>wrong</em>! It was just the Waiting God getting in my thoughts again, it <em>had</em> to be wrong! Who cared about humanity! If it would make the Waiting God right, I was against it!

A familiar cold feeling flowed through me. It was like I was watching my own thoughts from a distance. I saw them fighting, the part of me that saw the Waiting as the only shelter from the chaos of the world, and the part of me that saw the Waiting as a monster who had exploited me without remorse. I had always told myself I would look at the truth without filters, but it was hard to see past their rage. They were both afraid that if they let me look, then the truth wouldn't be what they wanted it to be.

But the truth is never what you want. And if you want to change it into what you want, then you need to see it for what it is.

I peeled them both away, forcing back my rage, coldly opening myself up to learning what I was afraid to know. I was already crying. I hated it. There was much more to do, and I was crying <em>already</em>.

What did I know for sure?

It was a fact that Hiram had told that boy he didn't need to worry. It was a fact that Hiram believed that that was good, that it was sacred to the Blood God. Was it truly sacred to the Blood God? Every part of me said <em>yes</em>.

It was a fact that <em>I</em> had needed to worry. It was a fact that if I had not worked to protect myself, I would still be with the Dalners.

Was it a fact that Hiram would have told <em>me</em> that <em>I</em> didn't need to worry? And if he did, what would the Blood God think?

He clearly <em>sympathized</em> with victims of abuse, but he wouldn't have known I was being abused. He could easily have seen me and believed that nothing was wrong, then tried to reassure me that nothing was wrong. But how could I know for sure? Could I think back to any memories – yes, a memory came to mind surprisingly easily…

I was watering the garden out in front of the temple's living quarters when the woman approached. ????

"Is my son here? Svet – He's here, isn't he?"

I looked up from my gardening, the evening sun getting in my eyes, making it hard to see her. Cautiously, I said, "If there is a Svet here, if you'll just wait here, I can step inside and tell him that his mother is –"

"What is this? Is he here or not?"

"Just Temple policy, ma'am –"

The woman pushed past and went in through the door. On second glance, she was dressed like someone from the third layer, so she probably didn't understand our norms – even though most of the temple was open to the public, any living space was sacred, and it was taboo to enter one uninvited. I dropped my tools and hurried after her.

Indoors, Civeah was already there, helping the children clean up yet another mess on the big wooden dining table. Thank the gods she was there – I didn't know if I would have the guts to stand in someone's way, but Civeah saw what happened, and she stood right in the doorway to the dining area.

"Ma'am, you can't come in here, you have to step outside –"

"Svet, come here! I am your mother!"

Civeah seemed to be holding the woman back for now. I knew where I was needed. I slipped past them and knelt down next to Svet, who looked like he was trying to hide his tiny body behind a chair. He was a quiet kid – he looked about nine years old, and he had walked into the temple by himself a few weeks earlier. It was common for kids to move in and out of the temple without much fuss, and it was Blood Temple tradition not to ask about anyone's past unless they volunteered it themselves – what mattered was the care the Temple could give them in the present. It was six more years before Svet opened up to me about how his mother had abused him. It made me cry, knowing what he had been through, but also knowing how the Blood ways had helped me protect him even before I knew.

In the present, I patted Svet on the shoulder. I was the only person he allowed to touch him, but he seemed to like it when it was me. "It's okay," I whispered. "You don't have to go with her unless you want to. It's your choice."

????

In the doorway, the woman yelled, "How dare you stand in my way?! I birthed him, we have a bond of blood! How can you call yourselves a Blood Temple when –"

"Do my ears deceive me?" came Rohin's voice from the outside. He must have heard the commotion. "Did someone wonder if this is not a Blood Temple?" Rohin never raised his voice, but you could <em>tell</em> when he was scandalized.

Civeah and the woman both started shouting, trying to tell Rohin their own side of what was happening. I stayed at Svet's side, whispering to him, reassuring him that no one would force him into anything. I offered to bring him to a quiet place away from the yelling adults, but he kept watching, transfixed.

"Ask yourself," said Rohin, "how should a child experience a bond of blood? Should he feel it as a cord for his mother to yank him about with? Or should he feel it as a bond of protection and trust –"

The woman was clearly trying to restrain herself now that a priest was here – ironically, since Rohin would have been the first to tell her that berating a priest was less offensive than berating a caretaker. "Your Worship," she began, earning her a skeptical glance from him, "I do not need a lesson in how to raise my son. I only ask that you give him back to me –"

"Ah, but he is not ours to give. Only he can make that decision. If he does not reach out for you, then you must ask yourself, 'what have I done to strain the trust inherent in our bond?' Then, perhaps, you will understand –"

"He doesn't come to me because he is too selfish to understand how much I've sacrificed for him! He <em>needs</em> me! Svet, come <em>here</em> –"

"You desecrate this temple with your words," said Rohin sadly. "You must cease violating our space. Wait for me in [???? the main hall] if you would discuss this further."

"You heard the man!" said Civeah, shoving the woman towards the door. "Scurry on outta here!"

The woman glared at us, but luckily, she didn't try anything worse. She turned and walked haughtily away from the building, with Civeah following to make sure she wouldn't come back.

Rohin and I exchanged a glance. We had all been in the middle of working when this had begun, but we would need to stay interrupted a little longer. The children were clustered together, waiting for us to speak – some upset, some not understanding what had happened. Quickly, we reassured them that they were safe, and that cleaning up the table could wait until another time. In his most serious voice, Rohin explained how there are some people who believe that children are the property of their parents, but here, we believe that every child is their own person, with their own fire that cannot be suppressed by anyone. I held Svet gently while Rohin led us all in the Prayer to Recover Strength. Like many times before, the words washed over me:

"…and though I have been shaken,

"And though storm and tide have tried to drown my flame,

"I know that my body is a place of power…"

<bigbreak>

It was impossible. It was too convenient. Was I supposed to believe that I could have just walked into the Blood Temple and they would have protected me from the Dalners? That they would have fed me, taken care of me, no questions asked? Without needing proof, without me having to record everything to be taken seriously? It couldn't be real. That just wasn't how the world worked. People might like to think of themselves as good, but as soon as it was difficult, their true natures would show themselves. I couldn't forget how my mother had abandoned me to suffer. I couldn't forget Morrow's memories of stranger after stranger closing their doors to him. No one would fight for you unless there was something forcing them to.

But I couldn't deny what I had seen in Hiram's memories. If I had been there… there was nothing that made me different from ????. The caretakers would have protected me, without demanding anything in return. And even before that… it hurt to imagine it, but when I had lived with my mother, I could imagine them visiting us on their rounds, helping to carry away the trash that lined the halls, making sure there was always food ready for us to eat.

I had thought it wasn't how the world worked, but maybe… maybe it only wasn't how the world worked <em>now</em>. How the world worked <em>without the Blood Temple</em>.

My teeth chattered. I felt dizzy and sick. Everything I had done… Every time I had checked and double-checked so I wouldn't miss what my mother had forgotten, every time I had forced myself to stay quiet when I wanted to scream, every time I had stayed awake late into the night planning out how to protect myself… It WOULD all have been meaningless. It SHOULD all have been meaningless. I should never have had to do any of it. I should have gotten to live in a world where I didn't have to work harder than everyone else just to live in safety. A world where I could be weak and helpless, where I could <em>afford</em> to be weak and helpless, because there would be someone there to protect me, to take care of me, no matter how many times I messed up.

I wanted to scream. Without thinking, I forced myself to stay quiet. But then I remembered. I shoved past my barrier and screamed, my voice filling my throat with pain, my breath coming back in quick gasps. I screamed again and again, bracing myself against the chair, tears slopping unwanted into my lap. It was worse than anything from before. It was a pain so intense that nobody could face it and stay standing, a pain I had thought I'd grown numb to long ago, suddenly ripped open and made fresh again. There was nothing I could do. The pain was inside of me. I couldn't make it go away. I didn't even <em>want</em> it to go away. This pain meant something. I knew it in the core of my being. This pain was my connection to everything I had lost, to every part of me that I had locked away so that I could carry on.

To the part of me that was the most Blood.

And then I knew. Screaming and crying, I knew. This was it. This was the reason I had been looking for. The reason that no part of me could ever give up the Blood God. Even the most Waiting part of me, the part that would choke away all my weaknesses to carry me through to the next day, knew it was true. Even with everything I had sacrificed to stay alive, staying alive had never been the only part of my plan. I had planned to stay alive… <em>and then be happy</em>.

It all felt so clear now. So this would be my final plan: to make a world where it was safe to let down my guard.

Was that what the Waiting God wanted to stop?

Decisively, I cleared my mind and listened for the Waiting God. I brought forth its vision for a new world. And next to that, I brought forth my own vision for the world. Next to the god's grand design, it felt small and incomplete. But it was a strong seed, and it did not waver.

This smaller vision was flawed, of course. It had an element of our nature, but we could see its flaws so clearly. Humanity as it existed was shortsighted and selfish, and they would not simply care for each other because it was right. Any plan that would change this would have to begin with changing the nature of humanity. This was a vision for a world of humans who were happy in their lives, who were having all of their needs met. But within lives like that, they would never be motivated to change. Our greater vision took account of this. In order to reach a better world, humanity had to be shown that the path to happiness, the path to having their needs met, was a path of change. A path where they must set aside their temporary desires, so that they could work to bring about a better reality.

I interrupted the god's thoughts. What would this "path of change" look like for people who didn't follow it? The god was only imagining people who <em>did</em> follow the path and <em>did</em> get their needs met, but what if they didn't want to? Well, each opportunity for short-term gratification was a branch where they might turn aside and fall into their selfish habits again. The efficient thing was to make sure these branches were clipped away before they might approach them.

<em>What did it look like,</em> I repeated. Did it look like children having no choice but to obey their parents? Did it look like me having no one I could tell about the Dalners' abuse until I discovered a way by myself? Did it look like people having no source of food but to work all day a corporation?

Not exactly. Those were all flawed, human approximations of our will.

So that was a <em>yes</em>, then. This was how humanity would be forced into the plan. Isolated and exploited, slowly starved of their basic needs until they started to see the Waiting God's path as the only path of reality, and any other world as impossible idealism. Before I had seen all the memories, I had been unsure. I had thought its goals might have been good, if only it didn't have to kill the Ravellers to make it happen. But now, I knew how to see it through the lens of Blood. I had known what questions to ask to reveal the heartlessness in every part of its design.

The exploitation.

That seemed misguided. We had thought of the plan as <em>exploitative</em>, but it was not the <em>plan</em> that was the source of exploitation. None of these demoralizing worries about individual abuses committed by humans were a reason to doubt it.

But the abuses were inherently enabled by the plan. Hadn't we just thought of taking away people's options as a good thing?

The god was silent. It didn't understand, just like it hadn't understood the connection between me and its high priest. It generally thought that exploiting people was bad, but it didn't make the connection that that was an inevitable result of its plan. It was unsettling, but it also gave me a surge of hope. If it could not fill this space with an answer, then when part of me became part of it, <em>I</em> could fill this space with an answer. And my answer would be, <em>We are going to stop now.</em>

I had my own plan now. <em>I</em> would make the world a place like the one Hiram had envisioned. And even as the god had protested, it had still seen my goal as something it could value. If we could achieve a world where children could always be confident of the inevitability that their elders had a plan to care for them, then that would be a profoundly Waiting world. That would be <em>my</em> vision of what it meant to be Waiting. And no matter how deeply the god was committed to its plan, it could not completely dismiss me.

I was ready to approach the portal.

<bigbreak>

I slowly pushed myself up from the chair, giving my stiff joints a chance to move and relax, giving my eyes a chance to adjust to seeing the outside world again. I had been in the memories for a long time.

<em>My body is a place of power</em>, one of the Blood prayers had said. I stood up straight, trying to feel some of that power. A little of Blood, even if I couldn't feel it completely.

As if in response, the ground rippled and shook. As I stood in place, the building around me lost its form, turned into liquid and retreated into the ground. My eye was drawn towards the light of the sun, and all ahead of me, the city melted away, leaving a smooth, sunlit, fluid-like pathway, opening the way to my final destination. I knew what I had to do. I hefted the handle of Rinn's way again and began to walk.

In the distance, the portal stood atop a huge, five-sided pyramid, rising above the city skyline. Before I knew it, I had reached its base. The slope of the pyramid was just shallow enough that I could walk up the sides without losing my footing, and just steep enough to give my leg muscles a strenuous workout as I walked on and on. And I understood it now. The huge structures in this world weren't here to make me feel small and intimidated. They were here to make me feel powerful when I climbed them. To make me feel like I was their equal, just like Rinn had said.

As I climbed up the endless slope, I looked back on what I had learned. The more I did, the more confident I felt, and the more things I understood. I thought back to all of ????caretaker's memories, letting them flow from thought to thought, doing my best to absorb all the little lessons of the old Blood Temple. With my free hand, I copied down some more of the prayers on to my phone.

And before I knew it, I was near the peak.

Before I got too close, I paused to think, manifesting a flat platform into the side of the pyramid so I could rest. The portal and the god weren't the only things I was about to face. The others were already there. Morrow and Alchemist.

I could already see it through the Watchful Eye I had placed on Morrow. I had mostly been tuning it out, but now, I paid attention. The two of them were camped out on the flat top of the pyramid, a black and shining pentagon about fifty meters wide, centered around… <em>it</em>. I couldn't even see the portal through the Watchful Eye, it was like a blank spot in my vision.

Morrow and Alchemist were lying near the edge, cuddling on top of a messy heap of pillows and mattresses, mostly manifested by Alchemist. Morrow was still <em>able</em> to manifest, but he had usually been too depressed to do it. He had alternated between the hurrying forward erratically and sitting down too depressed to move. Alchemist had been taking care of him, trying to give him encouragement and reassurance. They had even talked to him a little like the way Rinn had.

I would probably have liked Alchemist a lot better if I hadn't had to do so much work to stop them from walking into danger. And I might even have been able to tolerate Morrow if the Seeking God hadn't pointed the worst part of him directly at the one I loved. But the past cannot be changed.

I hesitated. Was it un-Blood for me to think that way? Well, not for Morrow, certainly. Hating someone who abused your loved ones was clearly a Blood thing to do. But Alchemist…

I breathed carefully, keeping myself calm. I cared about <em>Rinn</em>. And <em>Rinn</em> would want me to care about Alchemist. I was allowed to be frustrated with them, but I had a Blood reason to care about them, too.

I didn't like that, but I decided to go along with it. Now I just had to figure out what that would look like in practice.

I listened for the future. I felt myself walk towards the portal. I saw Morrow hurry towards me and speak to me, ask me questions. I felt myself lash out at him. I felt myself hold back. I felt countless fragments of anger and tension. I saw both of them step away from me, huddling quiet and scared at a distance. I saw us keep an uncomfortable truce until the time came to enter the portal.

This was not the future I would choose. I could do better.

I listened for a different future. I felt myself pretending to be calm, answering Morrow's questions so that Alchemist would think we had an understanding. I felt the futures where my frustration built up until I struck him again. I had enjoyed breaking his fingers the first time, and I could enjoy it again. But that wasn't what I was looking for. I listened for a future where I would navigate my feelings, where I could keep the illusion going and maintain the peace between us. I saw the three of us waiting together at the portal. I felt myself staring at the portal, feeling isolated, just concentrating on keeping myself calm while I waited for the end. This was not the future I would choose. I would not be ready to face the Waiting God if those were the feelings in my mind.

I listened for a different future. I knew that both of them were already afraid of me. I felt myself march towards the portal, determined to make them be the ones to suffer instead of me. When Morrow ran to meet me, I shouted him down. I ordered them both to be quiet and speak only to answer my questions. Finally, at the end of everything, I could <em>finally</em> just make them give me the peace and quiet I deserved. No more staying on good terms with Alchemist just in case we needed more potions. No more letting words come out of Morrow's disgusting face. I would finally just get what <em>I</em> wanted. And then I could face the Waiting God with pride. I would be the one who was in control.

As much as part of me liked that future, it was not the one I would choose either. I could still do better.

<bigbreak>

After a dozen more futures, I found the one that satisfied me. I forced myself to my feet, hefted the handle of Rinn's wagon, and headed for the portal.

Morrow ran down to meet me, as I had seen. I caught his hand, keeping it close between us, out of Alchemist's view. I looked in his eyes to make sure I could see the fear there. "Don't speak to me," I said quietly.

I let go of Morrow's hand. He backed away from me. This was going well.

I pulled the wagon up on to the highest point, the flat top of the pyramid, and began rolling it across the black and shining floor. This close to the center, the sun beat down hard on my head and shoulders, burning away at my skin, even through my clothes. But this sun was more familiar now, and I could feel a bit of warmth amid the burning.

Ahead of me, in the center of the floor, I could finally see the portal with my own eyes. It was the same substance as the other portals, but it was so much more than anything that had come before it. Once my eyes were on it, it was hard to look away. Instead of being shaped like a doorway, it was like an obelisk pointing upwards, about the same height as I was, joined to the sun by a column of light, glowing black and white and every color of the rainbow at the same time. It felt like its power was spilling across the world, radiating a sense of awe and fear and purpose. No wonder Morrow and Alchemist had kept their distance from it.

Alchemist nervously approached and looked at Rinn's head, the only part of her that was sticking out of the foam. Tears filled their eyes.

"Is, she… You used, the…"

"The second one we made," I said gently. "She was injured in the fight. But she will recover."

"Will she… that one was…"

Alchemist was trying to ask about the side effects of the potion. The sleeping effect was very powerful. If someone already had a weak soul when they drank it, they might never wake up. So Alchemist's worrying wasn't unreasonable. In the futures, I had tried dozens of responses before I found one that would reassure them. "Examine her soul yourself," I said. "Feel how strong it is. I am completely confident in her."

Alchemist approached and nervously touched Rinn's head. Then they nodded and pulled back again.

Alchemist looked down over the city. I saw their eyes linger over the distant gouges among the buildings, where Justicar had fought us.

"She's not, coming, is she…"

"She's dead," I confirmed. "We couldn't convince her to stop." I waited for Alchemist to glance at Rinn, wondering if Rinn had been the one who killed her. I said the best thing I had found to assuage their worries. "We did it together."

"Oh. I guess, you had to do it…" Tears dripped down their face.

"I wish I could tell you something else."

"I know."

Alchemist turned and looked at the portal.

"I knew…" they said resignedly. "I knew… when we got here, there was already three…"

Those words had been confusing when I foresaw them, but now that I was here, I understood what they meant. The portal had five sides, just like the pyramid under us, and I could instinctively tell that there was one side for each of us. But the dazzling energy of the portal was strongest in just three of them – Rinn's, Alchemist's, and mine. The sides for Morrow and Justicar were duller, as if the power had been stripped down to the minimum necessary. Its full energy had no purpose unless you were still alive and still a Raveller.

"This wasn't right," I said. "None of this should have had to happen. All I can say is… it'll be over soon. We'll all go through that portal. You'll be home again."

"Will we, wait for, Rinn…?"

"No. I'm going to send her through unconscious. Just to be safe."

"Oh…"

I sat down, manifesting a long bench for the three of us, with a wide base so Morrow wouldn't knock it over later. My mind was racing towards what lay ahead in the portal, but I could afford to take a little time for closure. Alchemist sat down next to me. Morrow thumped down on the other side of Alchemist, huddling into their chest. Alchemist idly started feeding him a large candy bar.

"Alchemist," I said evenly, "I believe I owe you a great deal. Your potions have saved Rinn's life more than once now. And possibly my life as well. If there's anything I can do for you in return, I'd like to do that."

"You don't, have, to –"

"It's okay. Just tell me if you think of anything."

Alchemist's head wobbled back and forth. The only sound was the sound of Morrow's chewing.

"There is, maybe, one thing… I know you, don't like, Morrow, but…"

"It's okay. Go on."

"Do you know if he'll…" Alchemist glanced towards the portal. "Since he's not… with the god…"

I concentrated, just like if I was using the Seeing. I already knew what I was going to say, but Alchemist would feel more reassured if it looked like I had checked.

"I believe he'll get back to the material world safely," I said. "Even though he can't be part of the rejuvenation, the process for returning the Ravellers to the material world is separate from that."

"Oh…" Alchemist draped their arms around Morrow, slowly rocking him back and forth.

I gave them a little time to relax. Then I added, "We can also exchange phone numbers, in case you think of anything I can do for you once we're in the material world. I won't have any magical abilities, but… people say I'm very capable." I pulled out my phone.

Alchemist shivered. "I, didn't, have my phone, on me, when…"

In the future, Alchemist had also worried they'd be forgetful. If I just told them my number, they might not remember it. And if <em>they</em> told me <em>their</em> number, they thought they might accidentally give me the wrong number. "Here's what we'll do," I said. "You can manifest a copy of your phone. It will have your phone number in it, so I can copy that number into my real phone. Then I'll call you once we get back to the material world. I won't be able to call right away, because I'll be taking care of Rinn, but I'll try to call within a day or two."

Alchemist nodded. They manifested their phone, and thumbed through it to find where it would show their number. "If I could, also, give this to, Morrow, and, Rinn…"

I carefully copied Alchemist's number. "Rinn and Morrow both lost their real phones in the Stern God's world. But the lost phones will still go back to the material world with them. So I can write down Morrow's number now and then text it to you when I'm back, and for Rinn, I can give Rinn <em>your</em> number –"

Alchemist flinched a bit. They had realized, based on what I said, that I wasn't willing to let Morrow know <em>my</em> number. I was trying not to force Alchemist to think about the conflict between us, but it would have been easier if Alchemist wasn't so smart.

Pretending not to notice, I continued, "I could give hers to you, I assume she'd be okay with that, but I just –" I carefully kept any hint of resentment out of my voice. This wasn't about Morrow. "– I just want to make sure to respect everyone's boundaries."

"I, understand."

<bigbreak>

Before long, there wasn't much left for us to say to each other.

"We should go through the portal now," I said.

Morrow panicked and jerked away, as I had known he would at the thought of returning to the material world. But because I had made the bench sturdy enough, he didn't fall or break anything.

"Morrow," I said levelly.

I had struggled with how to feel about Morrow. I hated him, and part of me felt sorry for him, and I hated him more because I felt sorry for him. And as much as I wanted him to just shut up and stay in a corner, I knew that wasn't how I wanted to leave things right before I went through the portal. It wasn't Blood.

Morrow's eyes were still bugging out. Even with Alchemist here to soothe him, he was terrified. Part of me felt a sick satisfaction at that. But that wasn't what I was trying to do. "I'm not going to hurt you," I said. "I just want to say…"

<em>Rinn</em> had forgiven him, even tried to encourage and support him. I could never do that. But the Blood Temple didn't have to be all love and support all the time, just like it wasn't all rage and violence all the time. They understood that there could be serious conflicts between people, and sometimes you needed strong boundaries to keep everyone from getting hurt. And sometimes you needed to fight to protect those boundaries, but sometimes, the time for fighting was in the past. I had made Morrow lower than me, and now, it was time to bring him back up to equal.

"I just want to say…" I continued. It was hard to make the words come out, but as I spoke, I felt like a tension was being released from me. "I just want you to know, I hope you can find peace. We can never be friends, but, but… Rinn cares about you. And I… I care about what the gods have done to you. You didn't deserve what happened, any more than the rest of us did."

I held out my hand. Morrow didn't take it right away, but I kept holding it out, knowing it would only take time. Finally, he leaned forward with both hands and clasped them around mine, crying. I pulled him to his feet, holding him a short distance away from me, but balancing him as he stumbled.

"I'm going to make the world a better place," I said. "I'm going to make it so that the abuse and neglect that were done to you, and the abuse and neglect that were done to me, will never happen again."

Morrow said something in a small voice. Even through the Watchful Eye, I couldn't quite hear it. It might have been, "yeah, right". Or it might have been, "thank you".

I turned and faced the portal.

It was like waves of power were rolling off of it, pushing me back and away. But it wasn't a forbiddance. It wasn't actually trying to keep me away. It was a challenge, daring me to push my way against the waves, to assert my right to occupy my space in the world.

I stepped forward, pulling Rinn's wagon with one hand. Alongside me, Morrow and Alchemist followed, a little more hesitantly. I took another step, and another. The portal loomed ahead of us, black and formidable. It was time. Time for the gods to face us.

We fanned out around the obelisk, each looking for the side that called to us the most deeply. One for me and one for Alchemist, the Ravellers who were still conscious. One for Morrow, dull but still waiting to take him home. At my left, one for Justicar, which would remain unvisited and silent. And at my right, one for Rinn, still alive and brimming with energy.

I unmanifested part of the foam holding Rinn in place, just enough for me to move her arm. Solemnly, I cupped her small hand in mine, reverently lifting it and holding it near the portal's surface.

It was time. I could feel it like the sun burning me in the shadows, like thunder shaking me to the bone. Across from me, Alchemist and Morrow felt it too. Moving as one, we took the final step. With one hand, I pressed Rinn's hand into the unearthly blackness. With the other, I touched the side meant for the Farseer.

I felt myself lurch forward, my hand suddenly empty. I looked and saw Rinn's arm passing through mine as if it wasn't there, a translucent echo, our bodies unmoored from the world. A dizziness came over me, darkness closing in all around, the primeval energy of the portal expanding to drown me. The stars awakened. Where was my body? Hadn't we had a body? I was already slipping away. I reached for my thoughts, but the mind slid from my grip like nothing. Worlds spun past, worlds of geometry in perfect balance, worlds of foundations resting subtly askew, waiting centuries for the right moment to lurch apart. Something wavered at the edge of memory, something terribly important, something merely human. And then it passed, fading into the innumerable stars.
