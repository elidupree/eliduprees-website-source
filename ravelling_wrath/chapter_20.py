<em>Uuuuuuggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.</em>

It would have been so easy to just go back to sleep again. ?????. But ?????. My arms and legs were full of pins and needles. My mouth felt like it was full of fuzzy cloth. And I needed to pee real bad.

I stubbornly clung onto consciousness.

I tried to sit up. It didn't work very well. I just sort of twitched like a dying fish. Getting up was a huge pain. I should just go back to sleep. But I really did need to get up. I needed to pee. It was a pretty unfamiliar sensation.

Right, that hadn't happened in a whileâ€¦

<em>Wait a minute, if I need to pee, does that mean I'm not in the Otherworld anymore?! Where am I?</em> I decided to ask that out loud, in case Mom or Dad or someone else was listening. "Ooeauuhhh uaaahhhh," I said.

The floorboards creaked as I heard the thump-thump-thump of a heavy shape rushing to my side.

I tried to sit up again. A hand pushed me down. "Shhhhh. Shhhhh. It'll be okay," said a soothing voice.
