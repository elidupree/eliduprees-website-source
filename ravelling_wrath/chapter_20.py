[????? Probably cut: It was time to move forward with my <em>other</em> plan.]

If I was going to spend time studying the past, I would need to get comfortable. I manifested a familiar reclining chair and sat down. I wasn't comfortable at first. An old wound bothered me. I shifted my position until it was more tolerable. My leg was cramped. I reclined the chair just right to let the leg relax. The skin on both legs itched where they had gotten warm from walking. I concentrated until the itch subsided.

Finally, my body stopped interrupting my thoughts.

The sun was glaring in my eyes. I had chosen an indoor spot to rest, but the sun shone through a window, and the reflection on the far wall was too bright. I manifested a folding divider wall between me and the reflection, but even the ambient light in the room was glaring in my eyes. I manifested a sleep mask to completely shut out the light. Somehow, even that didn't make it better. Belatedly, I realized what was really happening. It wasn't the physical light that was bothering me. It was the Blood God's presence. I wouldn't be able to shut <em>that</em> out. And given what I was about to do, I wouldn't even want to. It would be better if I could be aware of it, even if it was a strain. So I unmanifested the mask and wall. Instead of shutting out the bright light, I stared into it. I waited until every part of me stopped seeing it as a source of pain, and started seeing it as a point of reference.

And then, I began my task. I began to dig up the memories.


If I wanted to know more about the Blood Temple, I would have to search among my memories for what I might know and what I didn't. I stared into the light, searching my mind for any memories related to the Blood Temple. It was like something just on the edge of my mind, something I couldn't quite remember. The only memories that popped into my mind were subtly unrelated. Why couldn't I think of it? Clearly, many of the former Farseers had lived in a time when the Blood Temple was still active. Did I have memories from those years? I did. Did I have memories from Farseers who lived in the fifth layer of the city? I did. The main Blood Temple building would have been at the main square of the fifth layer. I had seen a picture of it, in an old book I had found in a back room of the Stern monastery. Could I picture a memory of that temple?

Slowly, an image formed into place. The wide front gateway, with the Burning Heart emblazoned at the top of its arch. Echoes of the deep pounding of its drums on its festival days. Flickering images of crowds gathered in celebration or rage.

Somehow, the Waiting God was making things more difficult. It wasn't actively resisting me, but perhaps it had modified the structure of these memories before it even gave them to me. Memories of the Blood Temple had not been <em>removed</em> – I could still remember them if I thought of them – but it was harder than usual to think of them. <em>Other</em> memories had a tendency to come to mind whenever they were relevant, like if I thought of something related. But these memories didn't. They only came when I looked for them specifically.

Something about this made me hesitate. If the Waiting God didn't want me to see these memories, why wouldn't it remove them entirely, the way it had entirely left out the two early Farseers who had murdered Blood Children on purpose? But on second thought, it made sense. Its highest priority would have been to keep me from noticing that anything was out of the ordinary. Missing memories could have created inconsistencies that I could notice. But just <em>not thinking of something</em> wouldn't raise any suspicion. And it was just like the Waiting God to do things this way, to use the smallest intervention necessary to accomplish its goals. Guidance rather than force.

I kept searching. It was a good thing that Rinn and I had made that list of all the Farseers, so that I could just go through the list and not worry that I might forget someone. Many of the Farseers had only known of the Blood Temple from a distance. A few were more promising. I recalled passing through this gateway as a childcare worker for the Temple, ?????. I recalled passing through this gateway as a farmer coming to stand in prayer for the health of my livestock. I recalled passing through this gateway as a lawyer, coming to argue a case in Blood court.  [????? Other examples]

Now I had some places to start. Next, I would have to decide who to focus on first. What was I really looking for here? I was looking for the truth about the Blood Temple, but what part of the truth? Was I looking for a Blood priest who knew how I could connect to my emotions? Was that the most important thing I could learn? If I thought about it… the most important thing was… I needed to find points where I fundamentally disagreed with the Waiting God. When part of me would become part of the god, I could not be doubtful. I could not be susceptible to seeing things in the way it did. The most Waiting part of myself would have to be utterly confident in rejecting its plan. And right now, it wasn't. I hated the god and its plan, but I had felt what it felt like to <em>be</em> the god. The god wouldn't take the part of me that hated it. It would take the part of me that saw everything from a distance, the part that coldly picked out the truth without caring how much it hurt. It was a part of me that <em>wouldn't</em> care if I had to suffer and die, and Rinn had to suffer and die, and hundreds of people had to suffer and die, if I had a goal that required it. And if the Waiting saw the destruction of the Blood God as a goal worthy of that… could I truly say that that part of me could never be convinced? I could not. And so I needed an answer on the level of the cold truth. A reason that the Blood God's destruction could never be my goal.

If I was looking for something I would find abhorrent… That gave me an obvious place to look:

<em>How did the Blood Temple fall?</em>

<bigbreak>

It was finally happening. The demolition had begun.

It was hard to see through the grainy black-and-white of the television. I would have liked to be there to see that wretched structure destroyed with my own eyes. But there was a chance of riots by those Blood worshippers, and it would not do to spoil my comfortable retirement by getting caught in the violence. It was enough to know that it was happening.

I should never have taken that wretched case. But they were finally getting what they deserved.

I lay back in my bed as I watched the



[????? Notes:

important concepts for this chapter: Blood policies have flaws but the capitalist replacement is even more destructive; technology could be used for good if Blood and Waiting worked together

Yali taking notes on her phone (maybe use paragraph I already wrote below)

Maybe main plot thread is caretaker's "maybe there will be a better world someday"? ("I liked teaching children about the Blood ways much better than I liked dealing with Temple politics – it lets me feel like someday people will actually live by these principles")

Yali doesn't want to engage with the caretaker's nice memories because she has anxiety about children being cared for instead of handling things on their own; the memories keep leading back to a nice memory and she's like "what's so important about this?"

Main plot thread is that Yali needs something she's confident in that the Waiting God isn't confident at denying, but she doesn't have something like that; at first Yali can only think of things where she can see both sides and can't 100% say the Blood God's way is right, but finally the caretaker's dream of a world where children are cared for is something she can (with emotional struggle) finally admit is 100% right, but the Waiting God feels contradictory things about

Yali switches lawyer->caretaker when the lawyer is being annoying and irrelevant, caretaker->lawyer because it's harder for Yali to work with the caretaker's memories because he's more Broken and less Stern "well this is nice, let me see where it goes" vs "This Is How Things Are Logically"

so
"I need to find a confident thing" "how did the blood temple fall"
lawyer section
"Ugh, well, the caretaker also remembers the fall", caretaker section where Yali doesn't listen well because she's still thinking about blood temple policy rather than caretaking
...
Yali realizes that caretaking is as important as policy

Waiting God connection restored, bits of its thoughts, some of them contradictory, like approving of the caretaker's dream for a better world

Have to include enough details of the mechanics of the fall of the Blood Temple (via both memories) – "blood Temple banned the company; that arguably violated Concord of Temples rules so the Stern were putatively allowed to protect company operations; Blood higher-ups arrested, some of those that remain jockey for position illegitimately, encouraged by the Stern, and undermine public trust in the blood Temple as a whole; Concord of Temples withdraws recognition and reassigns bottom two layers; Stern Temple seizes, repurposes or demolishes Blood temples, bans Blood worship and burns Blood books

Maybe the caretaker uses "praise the waiting"

I decided to investigate the lawyer first. The first thing I felt was his frustration and contempt for the Blood legal system. [????? Shouldn't there be examples of specific memories here?] In Stern court, you only needed to prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that a defendant had violated the law. I – the lawyer – had done that many times. There were many restrictions on the arguments you could make and the evidence you could present, to prevent unjust convictions, but if you studied the law, as I had, you could rely on them to obey consistent rules.

Not so much with Blood court. In Blood court, it wasn't enough for me to prove a violation of the <em>law</em> – I needed a violation of someone's <em>blood</em>. That was irritatingly vague and inconsistent. Obviously, it didn't only mean people's literal blood. Literal blood was the highest standard – any case of assault where the victim was bruised or their skin was broken would automatically count. And property crimes would <em>sometimes</em> count, because it was still considered a <em>violation of blood</em> if the victim experienced fear or insecurity as a result of the crime. But if you tried to get someone convicted for theft or vandalism of a storefront, even if they were the most contemptible repeat offender? Ha! You might as well try to convince a fish that it was wet.

I was sick of being assigned to cases in the fifth layer. Now, I was proud of my work – someone <em>else</em> in my position might give up, but I would never abandon a case that I could still win. Not infrequently, [????? I found a way to argue that part of the crime had happened in the fourth layer, which was officially shared between the Blood and Stern temples.]. If that was so, the case would have to be reviewed by the ????? – the body that governed what to do with crimes that crossed between the jurisdiction of multiple temples.
 ?????
 
I took a lot of notes on my phone, too. [????? I had gone to the trouble of keeping it assimilated in the Stern layer] I wasn't sure if I was going to keep any of the former Farseers' memories after I was brought back to the material world. I would <em>probably</em> still have my own memories of <em>remembering</em> the other memories, but I preferred not to rely on that if I didn't have to.

And along with the portal, the others were already there. Alchemist and Morrow.

I would probably have liked Alchemist a lot better if I hadn't had to do so much work to stop them from getting themself killed. And I would have been able to tolerate Morrow a lot better if the Seeking God hadn't pointed the worst part of him directly at the one I loved. But the past cannot be changed.

I hesitated. Was it un-Blood for me to think that way? Well, not for Morrow, certainly. Hating someone who abused your loved ones was clearly a Blood thing to do. But Alchemist…

I breathed carefully, keeping myself calm. I cared about <em>Rinn</em>. And <em>Rinn</em> would want me to care about Alchemist. I was allowed to be frustrated with them, but I had a Blood reason to care about them, too.

I didn't like that, but I decided to go along with it. Now I just had to figure out what that would mean in practice.

I listened for the future. I felt myself walk towards the portal. I saw Morrow hurry towards me and speak to me, ask me questions. I felt myself lash out at him. I felt myself hold back. I felt countless fragments of anger and tension. I saw both of them step away from me, huddling quiet and scared at a distance. I saw us keep an uncomfortable truce until the time came to enter the portal.

This was not the future I would choose. I could do better.

I listened for a different future. I felt myself pretending to be calm, answering Morrow's questions so that Alchemist would think we had an understanding. I felt the futures where my frustration built up until I struck him again. I had enjoyed breaking his fingers the first time, and I could enjoy it again. But that wasn't what I was looking for. I listened for a future where I would navigate my feelings, where I could keep the illusion going and maintain the peace between us. I saw the three of us waiting together at the portal. I felt myself staring at the portal, feeling isolated, just concentrating on keeping myself calm while I waited for the end. This was not the future I would choose. I would not be ready to face the Waiting God if those were the feelings in my mind.

I listened for a different future. I knew that both of them were already afraid of me. I felt myself march towards the portal, determined to make them be the ones to suffer instead of me. When Morrow ran to meet me, I shouted him down. I ordered them both to be quiet and speak only to answer my questions. Finally, at the end of everything, I could <em>finally</em> just make them give me the peace and quiet I deserved. No more staying on good terms with Alchemist just in case we needed more potions. No more letting words come out of Morrow's disgusting face. I would finally just get what <em>I</em> wanted. And then I could face the Waiting God with pride. I would be the one who was in control.

As much as part of me liked that future, it was not the one I would choose either. I could still do better.

<bigbreak>

After a dozen more futures, I found the one that satisfied me. I forced myself to my feet, hefted the handle of Rinn's wagon, and headed for the portal.

Morrow approached me, as I had seen. I caught his hand, keeping it close between us, out of Alchemist's view. I looked in his eyes to make sure I could see the fear there. "Don't speak to me," I said quietly.

I let go of Morrow's hand. He backed away from me. This was going well.

I rolled the wagon close to the portal, where Alchemist was waiting. Alchemist nervously approached and looked at Rinn's head, the only part of her that was sticking out of the foam. Tears filled their eyes.

"Is, she… You used, the…"

"The second one we made," I said gently. "She was injured in the fight. But she will recover."

"Will she… that one was…"

Alchemist was trying to ask about the side effects of the potion. The sleeping effect was very powerful. If someone already had a weak soul when they drank it, they might never wake up. It was understandable that Alchemist would worry. In the futures, I had tried dozens of responses before I found one that would reassure them. "Examine her soul yourself," I said. "Feel how strong it is. I am completely confident in her."

Alchemist approached and nervously touched Rinn's head. Then they nodded and pulled back again.

Alchemist looked down over the city. I saw their eyes linger over the distant gouges among the buildings, where Justicar had fought us.

"She's not, coming, is she…"

"She's dead," I confirmed. "We couldn't convince her to stop." I waited for Alchemist to glance at Rinn, wondering if Rinn had been the one who killed her. I said the best thing I had found to assuage their worries. "We did it together."

"Oh. I guess, you had to do it…" Tears dripped down their face.

"I wish I could tell you something else."

"I know."

?????

"I believe I owe you a great deal," I said. "Your potions have saved Rinn's life more than once now. And possibly my life as well. If there's anything I can do for you in return, I'd like to do that."

"You don't, have, to –"

"It's okay. Just tell me if you think of anything."

[????? Alchemist physicality, short silence]

"There is, maybe, one thing… I know you, don't like, Morrow, but…"

"It's okay. Go on."

"Do you know if he'll…" Alchemist glanced towards the portal. "Since he's not… with the god…"

I concentrated, just like if I was using the Seeing. I already knew what I was going to say, but Alchemist would feel more reassured if it looked like I had checked.

"I believe he'll get back to the material world safely," I said. "Even though he can't be part of the rejuvenation, the process for returning the Ravellers to the material world is separate from that."

"Oh…" [????? Alchemist physicality, curling up/comfortable/with Morrow?]

I let them ?????relax for a little while, then added, "We can also exchange phone numbers, in case you think of anything I can do for you once we're in the material world. I won't have any magical abilities, but… people say I'm very capable." I pulled out my phone.

[????? Alchemist physicality] "I, didn't, have my phone, on me, when…"

In the future, Alchemist had also worried they'd be forgetful. If I just told them my number, they might not remember it. And if <em>they</em> told me <em>their</em> number, they might accidentally give me the wrong number. "Here's what we'll do," I said. "You can manifest a copy of your phone. It will have your phone number in it, so I can copy that number into my real phone. Then I'll call you once we get back to the material world. I won't be able to call right away, because I'll be taking care of Rinn, but I'll try to call within a day or two."

Alchemist nodded. They manifested their phone, and thumbed through it to find where it would show their number. "If I could, also, give this to, Morrow, and, Rinn…"

I carefully copied Alchemist's number. "Morrow and Rinn both lost their real phones in the Stern God's world. But the real phones will still go back to the material world with them. So I can write down Morrow's number and then text it to you, and for Rinn, I can –"

Alchemist flinched a bit. They had realized, based on what I said, that I wasn't willing to let Morrow know <em>my</em> number. I was trying not to force Alchemist to think about the conflict between us, but it would have been easier if Alchemist wasn't so smart.

"– For Rinn, I can give Rinn <em>your</em> number. I could give hers to you, I assume she'd be okay with that, but I just –" I carefully kept any hint of resentment out of my voice. This wasn't about Morrow. "– I just want to make sure to respect everyone's boundaries."

"I, understand."
