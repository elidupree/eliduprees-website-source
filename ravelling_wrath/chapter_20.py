[????? Probably cut: It was time to move forward with my <em>other</em> plan.]

If I was going to spend time studying the past, I would need to get comfortable. I manifested a familiar reclining chair and sat down. I wasn't comfortable at first. An old wound bothered me. I shifted my position until it was more tolerable. My leg was cramped. I reclined the chair just right to let the leg relax. The skin on both legs itched where they had gotten warm from walking. I concentrated until the itch subsided.

Finally, my body stopped interrupting my thoughts.

The sun was glaring in my eyes. I had chosen an indoor spot to rest, but the sun shone through a window, and the reflection on the far wall was too bright. I manifested a folding divider wall between me and the reflection, but even the ambient light in the room was glaring in my eyes. I manifested a sleep mask to completely shut out the light. Somehow, even that didn't make it better. Belatedly, I realized what was really happening. It wasn't the physical light that was bothering me. It was the Blood God's presence. I wouldn't be able to shut <em>that</em> out. And given what I was about to do, I wouldn't even want to. It would be better if I could be aware of it, even if it was a strain. So I unmanifested the mask and wall. Instead of shutting out the bright light, I stared into it. I waited until every part of me stopped seeing it as a source of pain, and started seeing it as a point of reference.

And then, I began my task. I began to dig up the memories.


If I wanted to know more about the Blood Temple, I would have to search among my memories for what I might know and what I didn't. I stared into the light, searching my mind for any memories related to the Blood Temple. It was like something just on the edge of my mind, something I couldn't quite remember. The only memories that popped into my mind were subtly unrelated. Why couldn't I think of it? Clearly, many of the former Farseers had lived in a time when the Blood Temple was still active. Did I have memories from those years? I did. Did I have memories from Farseers who lived in the fifth layer of the city? I did. The main Blood Temple building would have been at the main square of the fifth layer. I had seen a picture of it, in an old book I had found in a back room of the Stern monastery. Could I picture a memory of that temple?

Slowly, an image formed into place. The wide front gateway, with the Burning Heart emblazoned at the top of its arch. Echoes of the deep pounding of its drums on its festival days. Flickering images of crowds gathered in celebration or rage.

Somehow, the Waiting God was making things more difficult. It wasn't actively resisting me, but perhaps it had modified the structure of these memories before it even gave them to me. Memories of the Blood Temple had not been <em>removed</em> – I could still remember them if I thought of them – but it was harder than usual to think of them. <em>Other</em> memories had a tendency to come to mind whenever they were relevant, like if I thought of something related. But these memories didn't. They only came when I looked for them specifically.

Something about this made me hesitate. If the Waiting God didn't want me to see these memories, why wouldn't it remove them entirely, the way it had entirely left out the two early Farseers who had murdered Blood Children on purpose? But on second thought, it made sense. Its highest priority would have been to keep me from noticing that anything was out of the ordinary. Missing memories could have created inconsistencies that I could notice. But just <em>not thinking of something</em> wouldn't raise any suspicion. And it was just like the Waiting God to do things this way, to use the smallest intervention necessary to accomplish its goals. Guidance rather than force.

I kept searching. It was a good thing that Rinn and I had made that list of all the Farseers, so that I could just go through the list and not worry that I might forget someone. Many of the Farseers had only known of the Blood Temple from a distance. A few were more promising. I recalled passing through this gateway as a childcare worker for the Temple, ?????. I recalled passing through this gateway as a farmer coming to stand in prayer for the health of my livestock. I recalled passing through this gateway as a lawyer, coming to argue a case in Blood court.  [????? Other examples]

Now I had some places to start. Next, I would have to decide who to focus on first. What was I really looking for here? I was looking for the truth about the Blood Temple, but what part of the truth? Was I looking for a Blood priest who knew how I could connect to my emotions? Was that the most important thing I could learn? If I thought about it… the most important thing was… I needed to find points where I fundamentally disagreed with the Waiting God. When part of me would become part of the god, I could not be doubtful. I could not be susceptible to seeing things in the way it did. The most Waiting part of myself would have to be utterly confident in rejecting its plan. And right now, it wasn't. I hated the god and its plan, but I had felt what it felt like to <em>be</em> the god. The god wouldn't take the part of me that hated it. It would take the part of me that saw everything from a distance, the part that coldly picked out the truth without caring how much it hurt. It was a part of me that <em>wouldn't</em> care if I had to suffer and die, and Rinn had to suffer and die, and hundreds of people had to suffer and die, if I had a goal that required it. And if the Waiting saw the destruction of the Blood God as a goal worthy of that… could I truly say that that part of me could never be convinced? I could not. And so I needed an answer on the level of the cold truth. A reason that the Blood God's destruction could never be my goal.

If I was looking for something I would find abhorrent… That gave me an obvious place to look:

<em>How did the Blood Temple fall?</em>

<bigbreak>

It was finally happening. The demolition had begun.

It was hard to see it in the grainy black-and-white of the television. I would have liked to be there to see that wretched structure destroyed with my own eyes. But even though Blood worship was illegal now, there were too many people who refused to give it up, and an event like this could provoke them into a riot. It would not do to spoil my retirement by getting caught in the violence. It was enough to know that it was happening.

I lay back in my bed as I watched the gateway crumble, clouds of white dust spreading into the air. Then the camera turned, giving a view of the milling crowd just as a few Blood supporters rushed out towards the police barricade. In moments, they were writhing on the ground – the Stern police had released a sorcery against them. I smiled. I was not a cruel man, but those fools had brought this on themselves.

I should never have taken that wretched case. But at least they were finally getting what they deserved.

This was perfect, watching it all from the safety and comfort of my own bed. Even better that Eva was out of town, visiting a friend to "decompress". Probably to vent about me. But, at the very least, it meant that she wasn't here to nag me about wearing shoes in the bed. My shoes were <em>not</em> dirty. She never complained of a dirty bed when she didn't <em>see</em> me wearing them, so it was just another of her irrational –

As Yali, I pulled myself out of the memory. Many of the Farseers were tiresome to work with, and this lawyer was one of them. If I just let his memories go wherever they felt like, I would spend far too much time in his complaints about his wife. There was nothing wrong with his wife. She was an ordinary person with ordinary flaws, and I had no interest in his frustrations with her. But I had to work past them, because he had much more important things to remember.

He had thought of a <em>case</em>. A case he had been involved with as a lawyer, one that was related to the Blood Temple.

It started as an ordinary shoplifting case, which should have been nothing more than a small loss for us. And that was all it would have been, if ????, my boss at ????Corporation, hadn't insisted on micromanaging me. And then he had the nerve to blame <em>me</em> for what happened! I could still hear his voice ringing in my years from when he fired me – "I told you to get them arrested, not to bring all of this politics down on us! I will personally make sure you never work in this industry again!" And that shrill Blood Temple judge – "Did you learn Blood law from a book? [????? You know nothing!]" Curse them all.

I should have known from the beginning that ????boss was bad news. He was the new ????executive at ????Corporation, and I had worked I had worked at ????Corporation for twenty years, but he insisted on lording his position over me. He hated me because I was professional where he was crass. He made me report to him on every little detail of every case – like that one.

I was in his sweltering office on the fourth floor, showing him the files for six recent cases of shoplifting at ????Corporation storefronts. My <em>last</em> boss would have trusted me to do my job – trusted that these were routine cases that didn't need his attention – but not ????boss.

"Another six gone to Blood? What do we pay you for?!" he yelled, slamming his hand down on the files, spittle flying from his mouth.

I <em>could</em> have yelled back. But <em>I</em> chose to be professional. "Sir, there was nothing that could be done. I challenged them before the Concord of Temples as you asked, but the precedent is unambiguous. The fourth layer is shared between the temples, and whenever a crime is –"

"I don't care about the details! Make something –"

I was <em>about</em> to say that whenever a crime is committed in the fourth layer, the Concord of Temples assigns it to whichever temple is considered to have the greatest interest in the outcome. In these six cases, the defendants were <em>residents</em> of the fifth layer, which meant the Blood Temple was considered to have the greatest interest. If he had <em>listened</em> to me, he would have understood that.

"– Make something happen! Fight it out in Blood court if you have to! That's an order!"

"Sir, I am not an expert in Blood law," I said. That was right, I had <em>told</em> him it wasn't my expertise! I had done <em>my</em> job perfectly, I had warned him, so the whole debacle was <em>his</em> fault for ignoring my advice! I had even said "and so if you ask me to do this, I won't be able to guarantee that the results will be favorable –"

As Yali, I typed out, <em>????lawyer didn't understand blood law, <strong>believes</strong> he warned boss</em>. This memory was full of the feeling of looking back and feeling justified. But it couldn't have contained that feeling originally, and he wasn't still alive to add his own thoughts about it now. So the memory had already been rewritten to add it, while he was still alive. He had probably rewritten this memory many times, to cast himself in the best possible light.

Now that I thought about it, it was strange that the memories included so many exact words at all. <em>I</em> certainly couldn't remember full conversations this well, and I was known for having a very good memory. Maybe the Waiting God had somehow enhanced them when it gave them to me. Would that make them more accurate or less accurate? It was hard to figure out.

I didn't like having to try to guess which parts were the truth. Maybe there would be other memories that were less unreliable. I skipped forward to what came next.

It was irritating to be working at ????boss's "orders". He couldn't <em>order</em> me – he was a ????executive, not a drill sergeant. But I couldn't talk back to him – that would be unprofessional. So here I was at the Stern library, poring over my books, sitting at a cramped desk under the tall shelves.

I didn't even want to be handling <em>these</em> cases – they were beneath my dignity. But we needed something to justify it to the Waiting. Years ago, I had been "promoted" into a different job title so that ????Corporation could take advantage of a new subsidy from the Waiting Temple, a subsidy for legal services that "contribute to maintaining the order of the city". So now, a certain percentage of my caseload each year was required to fall within the Waiting rules. Having me work on routine shoplifting cases like these was an easy way to qualify, even if it was less valuable to the company.

<em>Anyone</em> in my position would have rankled at being seen as <em>less valuable to the company</em>, especially in front of ????boss. I would <em>show</em> him how valuable I could be, I thought. I would take the cases to Blood court and win. And then he wouldn't underestimate me again.

So, when I sat down with my books to study Blood law, I was determined to find something that others had missed.

I read from the Book of Blood, of course, but I also had to cross-reference it with other legal analyses and historical accounts. The Book of Blood was the most authoritative source, but for every place where it gave a clear definition of the law, there were fifteen places where it appealed to vague principles. It even said that the law wasn't defined by the Book at all, that the true law was defined by the "blood of the people", whatever that meant. Other books gave me a clearer picture. By studying the details of historical legal proceedings over the last hundred years of the Blood Temple, I began to understand the traditions and precedent that governed their decision-making. In that sense, they weren't so different from the Stern Temple after all.

Unfortunately, everything I read confirmed what I already knew: It would be almost impossible to get these crimes prosecuted in Blood court. First of all, every case had to begin with an accusation of a <em>violation of blood</em>. That typically meant an attack against someone's physical body. There were exceptions, of course. A threat could be a violation of blood. Even an insult could be one, if it was degrading enough. And of particular interest to me, property crimes <em>could</em> be violations of blood. Unfortunately, the Blood concept of property was very different from the Stern concept. In Blood law, ownership of items was determined by who <em>touched</em> and <em>used</em> the items in their day-to-day lives. You couldn't own an object you had never seen or touched. And the only people who had handled the goods before they were stolen were local employees.

Could the thefts be prosecuted as thefts <em>from the employees</em>? No… historical negotiations between the temples gave clear precedent against that. The employees didn't own the goods under Stern <em>or</em> Blood law. The Blood Temple had agreed that whenever the Stern Temple classified goods as the assets of a corporation, it would <em>not</em> consider the employees their owners. Worse, this rule was a <em>concession</em> to be Stern Temple, because otherwise the employees <em>would</em> become Blood owners by virtue of being the only ones to handle the goods with their bodies, and then the Blood Temple would have to defend the employees' right to simply walk off with the merchandise. So, as a compromise, the Blood Temple considered corporate assets to be <em>unowned</em>. And therefore, the Blood Temple could tolerate the Stern Temple prosecuting thefts, but the thefts could never be violations of blood. And if there was no violation of blood, there was no crime.

At least this kind of nonsense still had clear rules. It wasn't so different from Stern law, full of impossible situations created by historical compromises, from which it was my job to find ways out.

But there was worse. Even once there was a <em>violation of blood</em>, it still wasn't necessarily a crime. Or, to be precise, it wasn't necessarily <em>lowari</em>. Blood law described four types of violation – <em>????</em>, <em>????</em>, <em>chet</em>, and <em>lowari</em>. And the Temple would only punish <em>lowari</em>, even though the distinctions between the types were subtle and subjective.

The lowest type of violation was <em>????</em>, a mistake. It was for when the violator didn't understand that someone would be hurt by their actions at all. The Blood Temple answered cases of <em>????</em> by educating the violator, and no other punishment. The violator was encouraged to pay restitution, depending on the circumstances, but not required to. Violations committed by younger children were generally considered <em>????</em>, even if they were intentional, because it was assumed that children didn't understand the impact they were having on others.

Next was <em>????</em>, a crime of desperation. If you were starving and broke into someone's house to steal food, or if you were being abused and you killed your abuser, that was <em>????</em>. When a case of <em>????</em> came before Blood court, it was considered a failure <em>by the Blood Temple itself</em>, because the Blood Temple was responsible for making sure no one fell into desperation. It even triggered internal Blood Temple procedures to investigate how their services had failed the violator. That was interesting, but not helpful to me.

Third was <em>chet</em>, a crime of passion. This was the category generally used when an argument between peers turned violent. It also covered giving in to selfish temptations, such as stealing things that were left in public without knowing who the victim was. The Blood Temple's approach to these situations was to talk to the violator, to it encourage them to understand what they did wrong, apologize, and try to make amends. But even if they refused to apologize, the Blood Temple only considered that an unfortunate situation, not something where the Temple needed to intervene further.

And finally… there was <em>lowari</em>.

Blood law defined <em>lowari</em> as violations that <em>put one person above another</em>. That could be interpreted in many different ways. The archetypal example was forcing someone to be obedient to you, or abusing a position of authority to take advantage of someone. But it also covered small things, like publicly showing contempt for someone else's accent. Assaulting someone for your own <em>amusement</em> was generally <em>lowari</em>, because it made someone's figurative blood subordinate to your whims, but assaulting someone out of irrational anger was only <em>chet</em> – unless you were in a position of power over them, in which case it was <em>lowari</em> again. And rape was always <em>lowari</em>, even in the context of marriage – <em>especially</em> in the context of marriage, because intimate relationships were sacred to the Blood God, so coercion within a relationship was seen as violating a sacred space.

But how did the Blood Temple decide what was what? The distinction between <em>chet</em> and <em>lowari</em> often centered around the feelings that motivated the violator, but how could the Temple judge what someone was feeling? According to the Book of Blood, if the parties couldn't come to a resolution between themselves, the victims and the accused would meet in temple and "bare their hearts", and then "the blood of the city" would decide the truth. From what I could tell, this was nothing but a fancy way of saying that one of the Blood Temple's masked judges would question them and then make an arbitrary decision.

Once it was determined that someone had committed <em>lowari</em>, it was time for the revenge. Officially, the revenge was supposed to be carried out by the victim, although in cases that went to court, Blood Temple staff were happy to "assist" with the revenge, and the victim only needed to nod along. But victims of <em>lowari</em> were explicitly permitted to get revenge without ever going to Blood court – even encouraged to. "When you have been wounded, your blood cries out to be avenged!" said the Book of Blood. "Do not rush blindly into judgment, but do not let anyone push you into easy forgiveness. Do not make yourself quiet!" And theoretically, if the original violator tried to take the victim to court for the revenge, the Blood Temple would classify the revenge as <em>not a violation at all</em>. The principle was that when someone committed <em>lowari</em>, they put themselves above someone else, which formed a wound in their social relationships that could not be healed until they were torn down again. So tearing them down wasn't a violation, it was an act of restoring the balance. Of course, if they <em>hadn't</em> committed <em>lowari</em>, then tearing them down <em>was</em> a violation. Some of the most notorious trials of the last century had been conflicts over who was the original victim, so it clearly wasn't a perfect system.

Getting revenge for <em>chet</em> was permitted, but not encouraged. And if you got revenge for <em>????</em> or <em>????</em>, that was not permitted, and you were probably committing <em>chet</em>. Even if the revenge was unjustified, it was still only <em>chet</em> as long as you <em>believed</em> you had been intentionally violated, but it could be <em>lowari</em> if you were using it to control someone, or if you had lied about feeling violated in the first place.

The victim wasn't the only person who was allowed to get revenge. Anyone in a close relationship with the direct victim could get revenge on their behalf. And if a person committed <em>lowari</em> in front of witnesses, it was also considered a violation against the witnesses. The most extreme abuses of authority could even be considered <em>violations against the city</em>, meaning that anyone in the city had standing to get revenge for them. But that was very rare, and in most cases, you weren't allowed to get revenge unless you were close to the victim or had seen the crime yourself.

I set down my books. I had enough background now to start thinking about strategy.

In order to see any of the shoplifters be punished under Blood law, I would need to produce a victim. And either the victim would need to want revenge, or I would need to produce a second person who was allowed to get revenge on their behalf.

Fortunately, we did have witnesses – that was how the perpetrators had been caught in the first place. And among the witnesses, the ones who had chosen to report the crimes to the Stern might also be amenable to seeking revenge under Blood law. The only question was how to interpret the thefts as <em>lowari</em>.

Two of the six shoplifters had stolen food. I immediately discarded those cases as hopeless – no theft of food had <em>ever</em> been labeled as <em>lowari</em>. [????? To prove myself, I would only need one. I selected one that was promising… a few details, then, oh gods, THAT case, jump forward to another memory]

?????

As Yali, I stopped. Before I continued in the memories, there was something I wanted to check. This subsidy from the Waiting Temple… was it part of the Waiting God's plan? I listened for the god, but it was still out of reach. I would have to check again later. Meanwhile, I went back to the memory of the trial…

If only there had <em>been</em> a trial. The judge's order at the pretrial hearing left it indefinitely postponed, and then –

The memory of the pretrial hearing, then.

The Blood Temple didn't have separate courthouses like the Stern. Legal proceedings were conducted in ordinary meeting halls in the same temples that were used for [????? maybe more specific: the rest of Blood Temple business]. On my way to the hearing, I had to walk across a courtyard where children, probably orphans cared for by the Temple, played noisily in the dirt. I gave them a wide berth – it wouldn't do for my pressed suit to have dirt tossed on it by their rowdiness.

I arrived early, of course. The judge – no, the <em>Speaker</em> – was already in the room, standing ominously in the traditional long red robes and mask that completely covered their face. I couldn't even tell if it was a man or a woman. I had to remind myself that this wasn't Stern court. A Speaker, short for <em>Speaker for the blood of the city</em>, had almost arbitrary power to make legal decisions, and was only accountable to the Blood Temple's Circle of Elders. If I wanted to be successful, this was the person I had to convince.

"Speaker," I greeted, slightly bowing my head. From what I had learned, showing any more deference than that would be seen as groveling. The Speaker nodded back.

Soon, the other parties filtered into the makeshift courtroom. The thief girl didn't look quite how I had imagined her. She came in nervously, holding herself upright, wearing a plain, conservative dress. She was almost pretty. But I could see her piercings, and as soon as she spoke, I could hear the vulgar way she talked. She was clearly fifth-layer trash. No doubt this was her <em>only</em> conservative dress, and she paraded around the streets in straps that barely covered up those oversized breasts – not that I paid attention to that. <em>I</em> was a professional, after all. When she entered, I shook her hand firmly, looking her steadily in the eye while <em>she</em> shied away, and gave a polite –

I pulled myself out of the memory. I didn't care about this hearing – no, I did care about it, but I needed a break from this man. It wasn't even the sexual thoughts that bothered me. I had gotten used to the memories thinking sexual thoughts at inappropriate times, since it was common across almost all the Farseers, including myself. But ????lawyer's hypocrisy – thinking degrading things, then congratulating himself for being a better person – it was getting into my head in a way I didn't like at all. I could get back to this hearing <em>later</em>. Maybe it would be easier if I viewed ????'s memories in short bursts.

On the other hand, since I'd pulled myself out so suddenly, I wasn't organized on what else to do. I didn't want to feel like I was wasting time. I needed to keep going – no, there was something else I could do. I still had another Farseer to investigate – ????name, the one who'd been a Blood Temple caretaker.

What did he know that I was looking for?

????Caretaker's memories were organized much differently. They flowed from thought to thought, rather than being logically organized like ????lawyer. I knew he knew <em>some</em> things about how the Blood Temple fell, but it was hard to make them come to mind when they hadn't already come to mind. And I was tired of fighting with the memories. To give myself a break, I decided to just let them flow. To see where they would go when I thought back to the Blood Temple in general.

<bigbreak>

Apparently, time has seen me become "the cool substitute teacher". I have always been told I have a way with children, and it would have made me happy if my stories of the old Blood Temple were what earned me that title. Happier still if it were the way I patiently listened to <em>their</em> stories of their lives. But it was something much simpler than that. It made me sad. In all their other classes, these kids were being told to keep their heads down and study. All I had to do to be "cool" was to give them a break from that, a chance to relax and move their bodies.

I was in the middle school today, covering for a math class. I had let the kids rearrange the desks, and a bunch of them had made a circle to play a game with each other. The others had found their own little pursuits. Noki, who'd just turned fourteen, was sitting on the windowsill and staring out the window – it was a beautiful day outside. No kind of day to keep these kids indoors studying math.

Principal Cossaman would have wanted me to keep them "on task", but it never seemed right to enforce the Stern rules on these kids. Nowadays, half of their parents were away in the factories from dawn to dusk, and came home too tired to spend time with their children. Who could blame them for wanting more space, more affection?

The Stern tell us that things are better than ever, because of all this "progress". Because the parents are away building all the newest computers and automobiles and whatever great inventions the Seeking have dreamed up. When I was young, a car was a luxury for the rich, and now they are everywhere. I remember when Noki confided in me that his family didn't always have food on the table, and also mentioned his family's car like it was the most normal thing in the world. But are they happy? Are people happier now? I can't help but wonder if we could have gone a different way. If we could have had all this marvelous technology, but also had our children be happy.

"Mister!" one of them piped up. "Mister, are you listening?"

I blinked, bringing myself back to the present, where a few of the kids were gathered around me, eagerly asking me questions. "Ah, did I doze off there?"

One of them leaned forward. "Is it true that Blood temples had giant orgies every year?"

I smiled wistfully. Nowadays, kids only wanted to hear the gory details, about the orgies, the floggings. I suppose that kids have always asked about these things, because kids always do what kids do best, hunting after the highs and lows of life until they find their place in the world. But it used to be that there were another kind of questions, too. Ten years ago, there were kids who asked questions like "why aren't we allowed to say the Blood prayers anymore?" and "my granddad says the [????? something about how an older family member is affected socially/economically]". But for kids growing up today, the Blood Temple was just a part of history.

And what did I tell them? Yes, there were holy days when we hosted orgies. Yes, criminals who severely exploited people were sometimes stripped naked and flogged in the public square. But that wasn't what the Blood Temple was really about. And no, I couldn't tell them any stories about that, because Blood tradition forbade gossiping about someone's past punishment. No, I wouldn't disregard Blood tradition just because the Blood Temple was gone now. There were reasons for how we did things. After someone was punished, they needed to be given the chance to return to equal status in society. If you treated their humiliation as a funny thing to gossip about, you were stepping on them for your own amusement. That was <em>lowari</em>.

No… none of that was what the Blood Temple was really about.

What a pity that most of these kids would have to grow much older before they would appreciate my fond memories of the hard work, the satisfying work of Blood. As I often did, I made a compromise, telling the hectic story of our work during the relief effort for Hurricane Fjarl –

No… as Yali, I didn't have to compromise with what those kids from the past were interested in. Now that I had touched the thought of <em>what the Blood Temple was really about</em> within ?????caretaker's memories, I could skip straight there. It would be perfect – if I understood the true purpose of the Blood Temple, that would be something I could use against the Waiting God.

It was a time of peace, a slow autumn when the days were warm and the temple well-stocked, years before the hurricane put us in the middle of recovery again. It had been a good year for the eastern farmland, and ?????

[????? Brief descriptions of reading from the book of blood to the children – an audience ranging from the smallest children to the elderly, because everyone needs it in their own way – including a bit of information about the Temple social structures – lovingly thumbing through the worn pages, "the book of blood was the only holy book that gets updated" "each one of you has a fire inside you" "no person can be above or below another"]

[????? In a time like that, the things we were doing were ones that we could afford to put off if something else came up. That's what happened. I was doing a thing when the boy approached me sick, and I decided that I could afford to let it go for that evening to take care of them]

?????

[????? Narrated memory of caretaker comforting a sick boy all night; entertaining him with a radio show he liked; maybe there's relevant politics about radio shows? Actually, let's change all the references to "radio" to something magical instead to justify the range not covering the whole city, and this is a good time to set up the details of it. Also establish the range of ages of children, Temple caretaking arrangements – perhaps "I loved all the children here, from the youngest to the oldest who were becoming more independent". But I especially loved the ones who were struggling, the ones who were clumsy and sad and didn't know how to ?????] Of course, I didn't love them <em>every</em> day. It's hard to love anyone when you've been awake for twenty hours cleaning up after the incredible variety of messes they know how to make. But caretaking isn't a feeling – it's a habit.

?????

I pulled myself out of the memory. I had thought this would be something important, but the more I looked, the more it seemed like it was just feel-good stuff. It was just ????caretaker looking back on something with rose-colored glasses. And it wasn't even a good decision! If you weren't having a crisis, that didn't mean you could afford to idle around, it meant you could afford to prepare for the next crisis before it happened.

In hindsight, it hasn't been very likely that what <em>he</em> thought was the most important would be the same thing <em>I</em> thought was the most important. I would have to hunt through the memories myself, like I always did. Maybe the right idea was to go over the story of Hurricane Fjarl after all. That would tell me how the Blood Temple handled a crisis [?????, which was much more important than this everyday stuff].

By the whim of the Seeking, the main temple didn't get the worst of the storm. The power was out all across the city, and we got a lot of rain, but that was all. But a lot of our smaller temples had been hit hard, a lot harder than we had prepared for, and they needed immediate help so they could keep serving their people.

We called in all the temple's part-time workers, and had a big planning meeting in the main hall. People kept rushing in and out, and everyone wanted to talk at once, and we had a big map of the city on the wall where we put a red mark for every place that needed more workers or food or supplies, and from the back of the room they blended together into a giant red scrape across half the city. In the first hour of the meeting we agreed to send everyone we could possibly spare to help our other temples. By the time the meeting ended at sunset, we agreed to send even more, because the others could spare it even less.

I was one of the few who stayed behind. I had always been overwhelmed by new places, so if anyone was going to stay, it might as well have been me. There were only five of us left – me, Civeah, ????h, ????b, and the old priest, Rohin – and overnight, we had to turn the temple into a staging area for all the supplies that were coming through. There was no one left to make the rounds in the neighborhood, to check on the elders and disabled people who lived close to the temple. It was a tragedy, knowing that they might need us now more than ever. But us five had enough work for twenty people in front of us, and it was vital to the lives of so many more.

I called all the children together and told them that today was an important day for all of us, and I needed to trust them to take care of each other while we caretakers worked for the hurricane relief. ????j and ????q volunteered to help us, and I brought them outdoors with me, quickly looking for work that was safe for them to do. I knew that it would take a lot of my attention to manage them, maybe more than the extra pairs of hands would gain us, but we were a community, and a community works together.

We hauled out almost everything from the temple storerooms. Everything that could survive the rain went into stacks in the temple courtyard, to make room for the truckloads of equipment that other workers were bringing from further inland. We were never ready. At one point, there were three trucks waiting to be unloaded at once, at the same time as a local family was trying to give us a cartload of donations and a messenger from the Stern Temple was trying to coordinate with us.

"We can't accept this food! Nonperishables only!" Civeah was yelling, waving her arms to try to get the point across through the noise of the rain.

Rohin briefly looked away from his quiet but heated conversation with the Stern messenger. As he turned, a gust of wind caught the red robe he was wearing, blowing part of the hood into his face. ????b had teased him for still wearing the robes of a priest while it was pouring, but he was proud to be a priest, and he refused to be seen without them. You couldn't take away someone's pride.

Holding his hood open with his hand, Rohin said, "I think, perhaps, we can? We can't send it onwards, but our own larder is nearly emptied. It is, perhaps, the way the least would go to waste –"

That was true. A few years before, we had installed an electric refrigeration unit for the temple larder, which of course wasn't working now. But ????h had had the foresight to keep it stocked with ice anyway, praise the Waiting. So now it was one of the few places that could still keep food cold.

"Who's gonna move it all?" Civeah yelled back, gesturing at the three trucks we still had to unload.

"We'll take care of it," said one of the donors gruffly. "We're all in the same temple."

"Your devotion –" Rohin held onto his hood. "Your devotion sustains us all. ????Caretaker, do you have time to show them –"

As soon as Rohin looked towards me, I knew I'd be stuck with showing them to the larder. Everyone understood that Rohin was in charge around here. That wasn't how the Blood Temple was <em>supposed</em> to work – tradition said that Blood priests should only offer education and advice, and let the listeners make their own decisions. But Rohin had a way of giving advice that didn't really give you a choice. If I didn't do what he suggested, he would keep saying "Ah, but perhaps you haven't considered –" until I gave in. In theory, the Blood Temple had rules that could stop this kind of thing – if someone raised the issue before the Circle of Elders, the elders would investigate, and they would certainly find that he had too much power to be an ordinary priest. Then he would either be ?????disrobed and exiled, or be promoted to a Speaker. Since he was widely respected, he would probably be made a Speaker, which meant he <em>would</em> have official authority, but would have to wear the mask all the time and wouldn't be allowed to give himself an identity separate from the other Speakers. But in practice, none of that would happen – Rohin was likable enough, and no one was angry enough to get the Circle involved, and Rohin was smart enough not to do anything that would change that. Only Civeah still bothered to argue with him, and she usually ended up doing what he said anyway.

So I showed the family to the larder. We had already worked all night, the dim light of morning was rising, and I couldn't wait for my turn to sleep, but I carried on. In minutes, we were a whole train of people carrying food items from the cart to the larder, people of all different sizes, me and ????j and ????q and the whole family who was donating it. I led them down into the cold larder and tried to show them how it was organized, but of course, it was hopeless – everyone stacked what they were carrying on whatever shelves they could reach. It was already so late, I was too sleepy to keep track of them all. Even so, I kept a close eye on where everything was getting put, because Waiting knew someone would be confused later.

While I was watching, I heard ????j scream from outdoors. I ran back up the stairs, almost stumbling from my fatigue. Out in the rain, I found ????j sitting in the dirt, next to a heap of broken glass. She had gotten tired while carrying a heavy juice bottle, and put it down to take a break, but she had put it on a stack of tarps that wasn't stable, and then it had slid off and hit her in the leg before it fell and shattered. She pulled down her pants to show me her bruise.

"That looks painful," I said gently. In my head, I continued, <em>but not bad enough that I can afford to stay away from my other duties</em>. I knelt down next to her, feeling the strain of wanting to help when I knew I had to keep it quick. "Would you like to head inside and rest? Remember, it's always okay to –"

"No!" she said loudly.

Sometimes, kids could be such a headache. If ????j kept working when she was this tired, she was going to hurt herself again. But that was her pride, and it was better to let her get hurt than to ask her to give up her pride. Eventually, she would learn her limits, and until then, it was my job to support her as best I could. "I know you can be strong," I said. "Keep being strong, but remember to be careful –"

"????Caretaker, there you are! We could really use an extra body over here –"

I looked up. Civeah and the others were straining to lift a pallet of portable generators out of a truck. They really did need help. Reluctantly, I started to stand. I patted ????j on the shoulder. "I'm sorry, but it looks like I'm needed. ????j, if you're okay to keep working, I'm appointing you as guardian of this broken glass. Don't touch it, but make sure nobody steps on it until someone can help you clean it up."

????j nodded firmly. I stood and hurried towards the others, fighting the feeling that I was leaving something unfinished. An emergency was a difficult time. If only we lived in a world where there was always enough time to take care of everyone who was hurt. It had almost seemed like we did, back when [????? call back to the memory]

That was… The same memory of the sick boy from earlier. As Yali, something was bothering me. This wasn't <em>just</em> a fond memory of old times. ????Caretaker actually felt like he had accomplished something then, and he was frustrated that it wouldn't get done now. But what was he thinking of? Staying up with the boy all night didn't solve anything! What about the next time the boy was sick, when ????caretaker might not be there? Someday, the boy would have to learn how to handle it on his own, and until then, this was just delaying the inevitable. But ????caretaker felt like this was a beautiful success, a <em>holy</em> thing. What was so successful about it? I couldn't tell. This was frustrating. It was even worse than when I was trying to understand the Waiting God – with the god, I could at least <em>ask</em> what it thought about something, and then I could form new god-thoughts to get my answer. But with the memories, I just had to hope there was already a memory that explained it.

There might be some way I could figure it out, but I wasn't getting anywhere right now. I thought back to the hurricane. The first memory that came up was the beginning again, the big meeting where everyone was arguing about where to send help first. I was about to skip forward to a different memory when I noticed an old man who looked oddly familiar. Not familiar to ????caretaker, but to me, Yali. But how could someone from eighty years ago look familiar? Unless – wait! It was from <em>the Waiting God's memory</em>, not mine. The man was dressed the same way as that group I had seen negotiating with the businesspeople. Who were they? ????Caretaker's memory thought of them as important people who deserved a lot of respect… people you'd see working with the Blood Temple, but not exactly Blood Temple leaders, either. I thought back, trying to find other memories of them.

It was a long time before, when I was just a few years out of school, the year my grandfather passed. I hadn't gotten used to my role at the Blood Temple yet, and I was nervous around all the important priests and community leaders who came by. That was how I met her – I was moving a cart of firewood down the hallway, to restock the beacon fires on the temple towers, when a proud, dignified old woman approached from the other direction. I hurried to move my cart to the wall so she would have plenty of room to pass.

She looked at me sharply. "You there! Young man. Why did you move aside?"

The lines of her face spoke of someone who did not smile easily. I fumbled for my words. "I – you – you're from the neighborhood council in ????, right? You must have important business, I'm nobody important –"

The old woman gestured at my cart. "You are doing the work of the Temple, aren't you? That cart must be very heavy – heavier than me, that's certain. In this hallway, you are the important one." She pointedly moved herself to the opposite wall.

"I – uh, thanks, I'll just –" In hindsight, I appreciated her show of respect. At the time, I shut my mouth and hurried on my way, not sure how to handle the situation.

But in the coming months, she made a point of noticing me, pausing on her way to thank me for my work, asking after how the Blood Temple was treating me. And in return, I heard her own news about her work on the neighborhood council. It sounded like a constant struggle, making sure everyone in ????neighborhood was advocated for, despite their many conflicting needs and perspectives.

"These ????Company hustlers are still trying to get [????? our permission to build a radio tower they control]. We told them that if the towers would be built in the middle of ????neighborhood, and if their broadcasts would become part of the culture of ????neighborhood, then the towers would be owned by the people, and the people would decide what was broadcast. [The businesspeople] laughed at us! When will they give up?"

"I don't understand," I said. "If they laugh at you in your own home, how do they expect to make you agree to anything?"

"They have nothing new to offer. But they are <em>persistent</em>…" she scoffed. "They want us to think of how wonderful it would be that they will bring jobs, that they will hire [????? people from ????neighborhood]. So their offer is that we will do the work for them, then they will own the result? What rubbish! But some of the weaker wits on my council are halfway persuaded by it. Young man, I fear for my grandchildren's generation… Just this morning little ????name asked me, 'why can't we have good radio like the upper layers?' Where did she even hear that the upper layers have good radio? I would hardly call it <em>good</em>, I have heard their programs, they are full of liars trying to sell you things you don't need. I told her, we <em>could</em> have good radio, but those greedy men will not let us have it unless they can use it to control us. We are a proud neighborhood, we will not be turned into working dogs for some distant company!"

I didn't feel like I had a complete grasp of the issue, but she certainly made it sound important. "I'm glad you're out there protecting us," I said.

"For what good it'll do…" she muttered. "No doubt they will find some other neighborhood who will be suckered into believing this… horsecrap. And then [????? everyone will be listening to radios selling them stuff]"

"Surely the Blood Temple would put a stop to that!"

"The Blood Temple is not what it used to be, young man. The Circle have made one too many treaties for my liking, and now they are too wrapped up in their internal politics to see how the world is changing around them. When I was your age, they would have come down hard on something like this, but too many things have changed…" She shook her head. "No, don't let me demoralize you. Maybe the Blood Temple isn't what it used to be, but you are part of its next generation. You can make it whole again."

"Me? I'm just a caretaker…"

She fixed me with a steely glare. "Caretakers are the beating heart of the city, and don't you forget it!"

????Caretaker felt encouraged when he heard that. As Yali, it was bittersweet. Unfortunately, the Blood Temple had fallen before ????caretaker had been able to live a full life as part of it… Unfortunately? When had I started unconsciously taking the side of the Blood Temple? True, that was what I <em>wanted</em> to happen, but I had been expecting to make a conscious choice. Not to just have it… sneak in, without my permission.

I still didn't even know the full story about how the Blood Temple fell. Maybe it was time to go back to ????lawyer. Yes… ????Caretaker had cleared my head, and I could put up with him for a while longer. The case he was on had definitely been related to the fall. I thought back to the pretrial hearing again.
?????

[????? some more of the lawyer; Waiting God comes back somewhere in here?]

[????? The speaker had a woman's voice and I didn't like that; maybe judging her for being businesslike, "she was probably spitefully against me from the start"]

[????? ????Victim described her situation, giving details at the request of the Speaker]

[????? "In this other case, someone who got revenge for an indirect effect without provable causation was pronounced justified. In the same way, ????victim could have reasonably expected that ????Corporation would pay her wages, and ????thief's actions limited how much ????Corporation could carry out their core business"]

"So the accusation before the Temple," intoned the Speaker, "is that ????victim's blood was dependent on ????Corporation, and that thefts have left ????Corporation no choice but to abandon her. Is that correct?"

[????? With distress in hindsight: "That is correct," I said.]

"Where are the decision-makers?" said the Speaker curtly.

"Beg pardon, Speaker?"

"The decision to terminate ????victim's employment was made by human beings. It was one or more human beings who considered ????Corporation's budget and, per the accusation, determined that they had no choice but to abandon the blood of one of their own. Let them come before the Temple and testify."

[????? But that would be important people from Corporation! If they were called to testify in a routine shoplifting case because of me, I'd be a laughingstock!] "Speaker, I appreciate the Temple's interest in [????? having the best possible information, but surely it's not needed so importantly]"

"[????? Not important? Does their blood not twist in their veins, knowing that they were forced to leave another human being to suffer? Would they not be eager to see that injustice resolved?]"

"No one at ????Corporation wants to see anyone suffer, I assure you! But surely you don't expect them to take time out their busy schedules just to –"

?????

"Did you learn Blood law from a book?" the Speaker barked. "[????? Do you never feel justice with your body? I DO expect them to testify – we have heard an accusation, where someone's blood is at stake, and they are involved! Do you think they are so high above ????victim that they ??????"

"Then we withdraw the accusation! Don't we, ????victim –"

"Fool!" the Speaker shrieked. "You cannot quiet her blood! The blood of the city hears your words as an attempt to control her, and by law, the accusation can no longer be withdrawn! [????? It's now clear why you are here. You came in intending to use her suffering as a tool to benefit ????Corporation. But suffering cries out with a voice of its own! If the decision-makers do not care, they may be guilty! Let every pertinent financial record be brought to the temple, and let everyone involved in the decision come to testify! The blood of the city demands it!"

"????Corporation most certainly won't be complying with such a demand! We are established within the jurisdiction of the Stern Temple, and the Blood Temple has no authority to –"

"So you came here with no intention of respecting our decisions? Begone from this temple, scofflaw! Run and tell your <em>masters</em> of our demands, and tell them that we will not be used!"

[????? Bit of conclusion to the scene, maybe I gathered my things and left]

As Yali, I concentrated, trying to sort out my own thoughts. In ????lawyer's memories, the Speaker had felt like an unreasonable person, irrational and shrieking. But when I thought about what she had actually said, it made plenty of sense. It was unsettling to think about. But looking back and forth in the memories, it was obvious what had happened. ????Lawyer had taken the Speaker seriously until he knew she was a woman. It wasn't too surprising – I had seen the same kind of thing from some of the other male Farseers. Whenever a woman was criticizing him, even the physical sound of her voice was recorded differently. It came out as something much more unpleasant than the way it would be recorded in my memories, or ????caretaker's, or most of the other Farseers'.

The contrast didn't feel so unsettling now that I knew it was just ????lawyer's sexism. I returned to the memories.

I never liked to think back to the time right after the hearing. When ????boss fired me, he scheduled a full hour just to yell at me for bringing the Blood Temple's attention against us. Did he ever apologize for ordering me to do it in the first place? Did I ever get an apology from ????Corporation after it ultimately worked out in their favor? Of course not.

But I did watch the news like a hawk. I had expected the case to fade into obscurity after ????Corporation rejected the Blood Temple's demands, but only the Waiting knows the end. The Blood Temple had no authority to compel testimony from ????Corporation executives, but they did have authority over the fifth layer, where ????Corporation had two storefronts. And they must have been waiting for an excuse to act, because they <em>banned</em> ????Corporation from the fifth layer and seized the two storefronts. ????Corporation appealed to the Stern to protect their assets. And that was where things got complicated.

Back then, it was unprecedented for the Stern police to enter the fifth layer. But the ????Treaty had changed things, creating a special arrangement to allow corporations to do business across layer boundaries. No doubt, when the Blood Temple signed the treaty, none of them believed they were giving permission for the Stern to enter their territory. But in a beautiful legal argument, the Stern Temple stated that the Blood Temple's seizure of ????Corporation assets was a <em>violation</em> of the ????treaty, and claimed the right to a "minimal enforcement action" to protect the assets.

By the time the issue reached the Concord courts, Blood warriors and Stern police were already fighting each other in the streets of the fifth layer.



[????? "After the hearing…" Lawyer summary of how things went down after the order; see notes below. Maybe leading into caretaker memory about internal Blood politics during the fall. Or maybe into the Waiting God's perspective, the Waiting God didn't plan this SPECIFICALLY, but it was one of the many ways things could have gone. Somewhat messy, but it was always likely to be messy, and in the end, it would be cleared up. Yali tries to argue against that but ends up frustrated, and reaches for the caretaker's thoughts again]

[????? Transition: Blood wasn't supposed to be about all this politics, it was supposed to be about caretaking, like that time]

There was the memory of the sick boy again. The same fond memory of staying up all night just to comfort him.

I hesitated. If ????Caretaker kept coming back to this memory, maybe there was something important in at after all. He was a thoughtful person, and even a bit of a cynic. He liked feel-good things, but not <em>this</em> much. So what was it?

This was unsettling. To <em>him</em>, it was so <em>obvious</em> why this would be a good formative experience for the boy.

[????? Yali hunts for the answer; it's basically "so that he grows up knowing that we care for each other and can rely on each other". Probably by visiting the memories of teaching children the blood principles?]

In this world, you couldn't rely on anyone. You had to know how to take care of your own needs. I could feel an emptiness inside me, the sickness, the guilt, of every time I had been been hurt because I carelessly expected someone else to do what I needed without me checking it. Every time I had hesitated because some useless adult had told me things would be taken care of. Teaching kids that they could rely on anyone was just going to get them hurt! They would blunder into danger again and again and again until they were burned enough times to learn not to trust anyone else with their safety! And if the Blood God thought this was holy, the Blood God was letting it happen! It would be responsible for their suffering, for <em>my</em> suffering! I could feel anger building inside me, anger at this man who would try to soothe away the core of what made me strong, what made me <em>Yali Seti</em>. I could just imagine him softly telling me it was okay to let down my guard. I could never let down my guard! If I did, I would be weak and helpless and pathetic, I would be back with the Dalners, I would be sick and no one would take care of me, I wouldn't get up in the morning. How could this be <em>holy</em>?! I could never accept it! How dare the Blood God try to soothe me! How dare it tell me that all my work was meaningless, that everything I had done to protect myself was meaningless?!

But if the Blood God was bad, then the Waiting God was right. To protect humanity from their foolish vulnerability, it was necessary to carve away the remnants of Blood, to clear humanity of the frivolousness that held them back from doing what needed to be done. [????? Then the world would be whole. The mass of humanity would finally be able to see the way forward. ?????]

No! That was <em>wrong</em>! It was just the Waiting God's thoughts getting in my thoughts again, [????? it was entirely bad and wrong!]. [????? Some of the Waiting God's thoughts were getting in my thoughts again [more or less details depending whether this is the first time that happens]]

[????? I had emotional reasons to want both results. I had to clear them away and seek only the truth] [????? the part of me that saw the Waiting as the only shelter from the chaos of the world, and the part of me that saw the Waiting as an uncaring manipulator] [????? arguing with each other, both afraid that the truth would be against them?] [????? It was hard to think because of the arguing. Slowly, I cleared it away, exposing myself to the painful direct access to the truth without filters]

I was already crying. I hated it. There was much more to do, and I was crying <em>already</em>.

What did I know for sure?

It was a fact that ????caretaker had told that boy he didn't need to worry. It was a fact that ????caretaker believed that that was good, that it was sacred to the Blood God. Was it truly sacred to the Blood God? Every part of me said <em>yes</em>.

It was a fact that <em>I</em> had needed to worry. It was a fact that if I had not worked to protect myself, I would still be with the Dalners.

Was it a fact that ????caretaker would have told <em>me</em> that <em>I</em> didn't need to worry? And if he did, what would the Blood God think?

He clearly <em>sympathized</em> with victims of abuse, but he wouldn't have known I was being abused. He could easily have seen me and believed that nothing was wrong, then tried to reassure me that nothing was wrong. But how could I know for sure? Could I think back to any memories – yes, a memory came to mind surprisingly easily…

I was watering the garden out in front of the temple's living quarters when the woman approached. ?????

"Is my son here? ????Name – He's here, isn't he?"

"If there is a ????name here, if you'll just wait here, I can step inside and tell him that his mother is –"

"What is this? Is he here or not?"

"Just Temple policy, ma'am –"

The woman pushed past and went in through the door. She was dressed like someone from the third layer, so she probably didn't understand the norms around here – even though most of the temple was open to the public, any living space was sacred, and it was a violation to enter one uninvited. I dropped my tools and hurried after her.

[????? Civeah was already tending the children indoors and saw what happened, thank the gods. I didn't know if I would have the guts to stand in someone's way, but Civeah did.]

"Ma'am, you can't come in here, you have to step outside –"

"????Name, come here! I am your mother!"

Civeah seemed to be holding the woman back for now. I knew where I was needed. I hurried past them and knelt down next to ????name, who looked like he was trying to hide his tiny body behind a chair. He was a quiet kid – he looked about nine years old, and he had walked into the temple by himself a few weeks earlier. It was common for kids to move in and out of the temple without much fuss, and it was Blood tradition not to ask about anyone's past unless they volunteered it themselves – what mattered was the care the Temple could give them in the present.

I patted ????name on the shoulder – I was the only person he allowed to touch him, but he seemed to find it reassuring when I did. "It's okay," I whispered. "You don't have to go with her unless you want to. It's your choice."

?????

"How dare you stand in my way?! I birthed him, we have a bond of blood! How can you call yourselves a Blood Temple when –"

"Do my ears deceive me?" came Rohin's voice from the outside. He must have heard the commotion. "Did someone wonder if this is not a Blood Temple?" Rohin never raised his voice, but you could <em>tell</em> when he was scandalized.

[????? It was years before he opened up to me about the abuse. But at the time, I just knew I had to care for the person right in front of me]

?????

<bigbreak>

It was impossible. It was too convenient. Was I supposed to believe that I could have just walked into the Blood Temple and they would have protected me from the Dalners? That they would have fed me, taken care of me, no questions asked? Without needing proof, without me having to ?????? It couldn't be real. That just wasn't how the world worked. [????? No one would fight for you if you didn't force them to]

But I couldn't deny it. I had seen it all in the memories. [????? The caretakers would have covered for my mother's problems, and I could have sheltered in the Temple from the Dalners]

Maybe… maybe it wasn't how the world worked <em>now</em>. How the world worked <em>without the Blood Temple</em>.

My teeth chattered. I felt dizzy and sick. Everything I had done… [????? Every time I forced myself to stay quiet/etc.…] It WOULD all have been meaningless. It SHOULD all have been meaningless. ????? [????? It should have been] A world where I didn't have to work harder than everyone else just to have my basic safety. A world where I could be weak and helpless, where I could <em>afford</em> to be weak and helpless, because ?????.

I wanted to scream. Without thinking, I forced myself to stay quiet. But then I remembered. I screamed, my voice filling my throat with pain, my breath coming back in quick gasps. I screamed again and again, bracing myself against the chair, tears slopping unwanted into my lap. It was worse than anything from before. It was a pain so intense that nobody could face it and stay standing, a pain I had thought I'd grown numb to long ago, suddenly ripped open and made fresh again. There was nothing I could do. The pain was inside of me. I couldn't make it go away. I couldn't even <em>wish</em> for it to go away. I <em>needed</em> this pain. I knew it in the core of my being. ?????


[????? I cried a lot, I didn't know what to do]

[????? Was this what the Waiting God wanted to stop? Yes, the more I put it together, the clearer it was. People being happy and cared for in their existing lives inherently meant that they wouldn't be motivated to accept a new structure. But when I looked at it as Yali, I could tell that the change resulted in isolating and exploiting people. Did the Waiting God want people to be exploited? No, and that was the unsettling part, it generally thought exploiting was bad, but didn't make the connection that that was an inevitable result of what it was doing.

[????? But <em>I</em> knew <em>I</em> believed that caretaker's vision was good. What did the Waiting God think of that vision? It could see the Waiting nature of it. It was struggling against itself, while I was now confident of my beliefs. I was ready to approach the portal.

[????? I began slowly climbing… As I climbed, I looked back on what I had learned, and the more I did, they more confident I felt]

 [????? Notes:
 
 Caretaker details: the Temple will protect children from their parents, reading from the book of blood to the children, "no one can be above or below another", traveling to the homes of the infirm for outreach

important concepts for this chapter: Blood policies have flaws but the capitalist replacement is even more destructive; technology could be used for good if Blood and Waiting worked together

Yali taking notes on her phone (maybe use paragraph I already wrote below)

Maybe main plot thread is caretaker's "maybe there will be a better world someday"? ("I liked teaching children about the Blood ways much better than I liked dealing with Temple politics – it lets me feel like someday people will actually live by these principles")

Yali doesn't want to engage with the caretaker's nice memories because she has anxiety about children being cared for instead of handling things on their own; the memories keep leading back to a nice memory and she's like "what's so important about this?"

Main plot thread is that Yali needs something she's confident in that the Waiting God isn't confident at denying, but she doesn't have something like that; at first Yali can only think of things where she can see both sides and can't 100% say the Blood God's way is right, but finally the caretaker's dream of a world where children are cared for is something she can (with emotional struggle) finally admit is 100% right, but the Waiting God feels contradictory things about

Yali switches lawyer->caretaker when the lawyer is being annoying and irrelevant, caretaker->lawyer because it's harder for Yali to work with the caretaker's memories because he's more Broken and less Stern "well this is nice, let me see where it goes" vs "This Is How Things Are Logically"

so
"I need to find a confident thing" "how did the blood temple fall"
lawyer section
"Ugh, well, the caretaker also remembers the fall", caretaker section where Yali doesn't listen well because she's still thinking about blood temple policy rather than caretaking
...
Yali realizes that caretaking is as important as policy

Waiting God connection restored, bits of its thoughts, some of them contradictory, like approving of the caretaker's dream for a better world

Have to include enough details of the mechanics of the fall of the Blood Temple (via both memories) – "blood Temple banned the company; that arguably violated Concord of Temples rules so the Stern were putatively allowed to protect company operations; Blood higher-ups arrested, some of those that remain jockey for position illegitimately, encouraged by the Stern, and undermine public trust in the blood Temple as a whole; Concord of Temples withdraws recognition and reassigns bottom two layers; Stern Temple seizes, repurposes or demolishes Blood temples, bans Blood worship and burns Blood books

Maybe the caretaker uses "praise the waiting"

]




I decided to investigate the lawyer first. The first thing I felt was his frustration and contempt for the Blood legal system. [????? Shouldn't there be examples of specific memories here?] In Stern court, you only needed to prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that a defendant had violated the law. I – the lawyer – had done that many times. There were many restrictions on the arguments you could make and the evidence you could present, to prevent unjust convictions, but if you studied the law, as I had, you could rely on them to obey consistent rules.

Not so much with Blood court. In Blood court, it wasn't enough for me to prove a violation of the <em>law</em> – I needed a violation of someone's <em>blood</em>. That was irritatingly vague and inconsistent. Obviously, it didn't only mean people's literal blood. Literal blood was the highest standard – any case of assault where the victim was bruised or their skin was broken would automatically count. And property crimes would <em>sometimes</em> count, because it was still considered a <em>violation of blood</em> if the victim experienced fear or insecurity as a result of the crime. But if you tried to get someone convicted for theft or vandalism of a storefront, even if they were the most contemptible repeat offender? Ha! You might as well try to convince a fish that it was wet.

I was sick of being assigned to cases in the fifth layer. Now, I was proud of my work – someone <em>else</em> in my position might give up, but I would never abandon a case that I could still win. Not infrequently, [????? I found a way to argue that part of the crime had happened in the fourth layer, which was officially shared between the Blood and Stern temples.]. If that was so, the case would have to be reviewed by the ????? – the body that governed what to do with crimes that crossed between the jurisdiction of multiple temples.
 ?????
 
I took a lot of notes on my phone, too. [????? I had gone to the trouble of keeping it assimilated in the Stern layer] I wasn't sure if I was going to keep any of the former Farseers' memories after I was brought back to the material world. I would <em>probably</em> still have my own memories of <em>remembering</em> the other memories, but I preferred not to rely on that if I didn't have to.




 ?????

[????? Probably cut: And along with the portal, the others were already there. Alchemist and Morrow.]

[????? For a while I had been slowly climbing what turned out to be a five sided pyramid. I was near the top. I could already see it through the watchful eye. Alchemist and Morrow were camped on the top, but not next to the portal. Heap of mattresses/pillows; Morrow was able to manifest, but mostly wasn't doing it. He was a a bit erratic but mostly depressed, Alchemist was taking care of him, even talking to him a little like Rinn had. The portal couldn't even be seen through the watchful eye]

I would probably have liked Alchemist a lot better if I hadn't had to do so much work to stop them from getting themself killed. And I might have been able to tolerate Morrow if the Seeking God hadn't pointed the worst part of him directly at the one I loved. But the past cannot be changed.

I hesitated. Was it un-Blood for me to think that way? Well, not for Morrow, certainly. Hating someone who abused your loved ones was clearly a Blood thing to do. But Alchemist…

I breathed carefully, keeping myself calm. I cared about <em>Rinn</em>. And <em>Rinn</em> would want me to care about Alchemist. I was allowed to be frustrated with them, but I had a Blood reason to care about them, too.

I didn't like that, but I decided to go along with it. Now I just had to figure out what that would mean in practice.

I listened for the future. I felt myself walk towards the portal. I saw Morrow hurry towards me and speak to me, ask me questions. I felt myself lash out at him. I felt myself hold back. I felt countless fragments of anger and tension. I saw both of them step away from me, huddling quiet and scared at a distance. I saw us keep an uncomfortable truce until the time came to enter the portal.

This was not the future I would choose. I could do better.

I listened for a different future. I felt myself pretending to be calm, answering Morrow's questions so that Alchemist would think we had an understanding. I felt the futures where my frustration built up until I struck him again. I had enjoyed breaking his fingers the first time, and I could enjoy it again. But that wasn't what I was looking for. I listened for a future where I would navigate my feelings, where I could keep the illusion going and maintain the peace between us. I saw the three of us waiting together at the portal. I felt myself staring at the portal, feeling isolated, just concentrating on keeping myself calm while I waited for the end. This was not the future I would choose. I would not be ready to face the Waiting God if those were the feelings in my mind.

I listened for a different future. I knew that both of them were already afraid of me. I felt myself march towards the portal, determined to make them be the ones to suffer instead of me. When Morrow ran to meet me, I shouted him down. I ordered them both to be quiet and speak only to answer my questions. Finally, at the end of everything, I could <em>finally</em> just make them give me the peace and quiet I deserved. No more staying on good terms with Alchemist just in case we needed more potions. No more letting words come out of Morrow's disgusting face. I would finally just get what <em>I</em> wanted. And then I could face the Waiting God with pride. I would be the one who was in control.

As much as part of me liked that future, it was not the one I would choose either. I could still do better.

<bigbreak>

After a dozen more futures, I found the one that satisfied me. I forced myself to my feet, hefted the handle of Rinn's wagon, and headed for the portal.

Morrow approached me, as I had seen. I caught his hand, keeping it close between us, out of Alchemist's view. I looked in his eyes to make sure I could see the fear there. "Don't speak to me," I said quietly.

I let go of Morrow's hand. He backed away from me. This was going well.

I pulled the wagon up on to the highest point, the flat top of the pyramid, and began rolling it across the black and shining floor. This close to the center, the sun beat down hard on my head and shoulders, burning away at my skin, even through my clothes. But this sun was more familiar now, and I could feel a bit of warmth amid the burning.

Ahead of me, in the center of the floor, I could finally see the portal with my own eyes. It was the same substance as the other portals, but it was so much more than anything that had come before it. Once my eyes were on it, it was hard to look away. Instead of being shaped like a doorway, it was like an obelisk pointing upwards, about the same height as I was, joined to the sun by a column of light, glowing black and white and every color of the rainbow at the same time. It felt like its power was spilling across the world, radiating a sense of awe and fear and purpose. No wonder Alchemist and Morrow had kept their distance from it.

Alchemist nervously approached and looked at Rinn's head, the only part of her that was sticking out of the foam. Tears filled their eyes.

"Is, she… You used, the…"

"The second one we made," I said gently. "She was injured in the fight. But she will recover."

"Will she… that one was…"

Alchemist was trying to ask about the side effects of the potion. The sleeping effect was very powerful. If someone already had a weak soul when they drank it, they might never wake up. It was understandable that Alchemist would worry. In the futures, I had tried dozens of responses before I found one that would reassure them. "Examine her soul yourself," I said. "Feel how strong it is. I am completely confident in her."

Alchemist approached and nervously touched Rinn's head. Then they nodded and pulled back again.

Alchemist looked down over the city. I saw their eyes linger over the distant gouges among the buildings, where Justicar had fought us.

"She's not, coming, is she…"

"She's dead," I confirmed. "We couldn't convince her to stop." I waited for Alchemist to glance at Rinn, wondering if Rinn had been the one who killed her. I said the best thing I had found to assuage their worries. "We did it together."

"Oh. I guess, you had to do it…" Tears dripped down their face.

"I wish I could tell you something else."

"I know."

Alchemist turned and looked at the portal.

"I knew…" they said resignedly. "I knew… when we got here, it already had three sides… I only didn't know, who…"

Those words had been confusing when I foresaw them, but now that I was here, I understood what they meant. [????? The pillar was an obelisk with five sides, like the pyramid – but two of them were duller, not quite as brilliantly colored as the other three. There was one side for each of us – each of us who was still alive and still a Raveller.]

"This wasn't right," I said. "None of this should have had to happen. All I can say is… it'll be over soon. We'll all go through that portal. You'll be home again."

"Will we, wait for, Rinn…?"

"No. I'm going to send her through unconscious. Just to be safe."

"Oh…"

[????? I sat down with Alchemist; Morrow sat on the other side, overwhelmed]

?????

"I believe I owe you a great deal," I said. "Your potions have saved Rinn's life more than once now. And possibly my life as well. If there's anything I can do for you in return, I'd like to do that."

"You don't, have, to –"

"It's okay. Just tell me if you think of anything."

[????? Alchemist physicality, short silence]

"There is, maybe, one thing… I know you, don't like, Morrow, but…"

"It's okay. Go on."

"Do you know if he'll…" Alchemist glanced towards the portal. "Since he's not… with the god…"

I concentrated, just like if I was using the Seeing. I already knew what I was going to say, but Alchemist would feel more reassured if it looked like I had checked.

"I believe he'll get back to the material world safely," I said. "Even though he can't be part of the rejuvenation, the process for returning the Ravellers to the material world is separate from that."

"Oh…" [????? Alchemist physicality, curling up/comfortable/with Morrow?]

I let them ?????relax for a little while, then added, "We can also exchange phone numbers, in case you think of anything I can do for you once we're in the material world. I won't have any magical abilities, but… people say I'm very capable." I pulled out my phone.

[????? Alchemist physicality] "I, didn't, have my phone, on me, when…"

In the future, Alchemist had also worried they'd be forgetful. If I just told them my number, they might not remember it. And if <em>they</em> told me <em>their</em> number, they thought they might accidentally give me the wrong number. "Here's what we'll do," I said. "You can manifest a copy of your phone. It will have your phone number in it, so I can copy that number into my real phone. Then I'll call you once we get back to the material world. I won't be able to call right away, because I'll be taking care of Rinn, but I'll try to call within a day or two."

Alchemist nodded. They manifested their phone, and thumbed through it to find where it would show their number. "If I could, also, give this to, Morrow, and, Rinn…"

I carefully copied Alchemist's number. "Morrow and Rinn both lost their real phones in the Stern God's world. But the real phones will still go back to the material world with them. So I can write down Morrow's number now and then text it to you when I'm back, and for Rinn, I can give Rinn <em>your</em> number –"

Alchemist flinched a bit. They had realized, based on what I said, that I wasn't willing to let Morrow know <em>my</em> number. I was trying not to force Alchemist to think about the conflict between us, but it would have been easier if Alchemist wasn't so smart.

Pretending not to notice, I continued, "I could give hers to you, I assume she'd be okay with that, but I just –" I carefully kept any hint of resentment out of my voice. This wasn't about Morrow. "– I just want to make sure to respect everyone's boundaries."

"I, understand."

?????

[????? Yali says they should go, and Morrow freaks out about returning to the material world]

"Morrow," I said levelly.

I had struggled with how to feel about Morrow. I hated him, and part of me felt sorry for him, and I hated him more because I felt sorry for him. And as much as I wanted him to just shut up and stay in a corner, I knew that wasn't how I wanted to leave things right before I went through the portal. It wasn't Blood.

Morrow's eyes were still bugging out. He looked even more terrified than before, despite Alchemist trying to soothe him. Part of me felt a sick satisfaction at that. But that wasn't what I was trying to do. "I'm not going to hurt you," I said. "I just want to say…"

<em>Rinn</em> had forgiven him, even tried to encourage and support him. I could never do that. But the Blood Temple didn't have to be all love and support all the time, just like it wasn't all rage and violence all the time. They understood that there could be serious conflicts between people, and sometimes you needed strong boundaries to keep everyone from getting hurt. And sometimes you needed to fight to protect those boundaries, and sometimes the time for fighting was now, but sometimes, the time for fighting was in the past. I had made Morrow lower than me, and now, it was time to bring him back up to equal.

"I just want to say…" I continued. It was hard to make the words come out, but as I spoke, I felt like a tension was being released from me. "I just want you to know, I hope you can find peace. We can never be friends, but, but… Rinn cares about you. And I… ?????"

I held out my hand. Morrow didn't take it right away, but I kept holding it out, knowing he would ?????. [????? He clasped the hand, crying. I pulled him to his feet and helped him stand steadily, at a little distance from me]

"I'm going to make the world a better place," I said. "I'm going to make it so that the abuse and neglect that were done to you, and the abuse and neglect that were done to me, will never happen again."

Morrow said something in a small voice. Even through the Watchful Eye, I couldn't quite hear it. It might have been, "yeah, right". Or it might have been, "thank you".

I turned and faced the portal.

It was like waves of power were rolling off of it, pushing me back and away. But it wasn't [????? a forbiddance, actually trying to keep me away.] It was a challenge, daring me to push my way against the waves, to assert my right to occupy my space in the world.

I stepped forward, pulling Rinn in the wagon with one hand. Alongside me, Morrow and Alchemist followed, a little more hesitantly. I took another step, and another. The portal loomed ahead of us, black and formidable. ?????.

We fanned out around the obelisk, each looking for the side that called to us the most deeply. It had five sides, evenly spaced around it. One for me and one for Alchemist, the Ravellers who were still conscious. One for Morrow, dull but still waiting to take him home. At my left, one for Justicar, which would remain unvisited and silent. And at my right, one for Rinn, still alive and brimming with energy.

I unmanifested part of the foam holding Rinn in place, just enough for me to move her arm. Solemnly, I cupped her small hand in mine, reverently lifting it and holding it near the portal's surface.

It was time. I could feel it like the sun burning me in the shadows, like thunder shaking me to the bone. Across from me, Alchemist and Morrow felt it too. Moving as one, we took the final step. With one hand, I pressed Rinn's hand into the unearthly blackness. With the other, I touched the side meant for the Farseer.

I felt myself lurch forward, my hand suddenly empty. I looked and saw Rinn's arm passing through mine as if it wasn't there, a translucent echo, our bodies unmoored from the world. A dizziness came over me, darkness closing in all around, the primeval energy of the portal expanding to drown me. The stars were coming. It was realer than real, as if everything we had done was a passing dream. Where was my body? Hadn't we had a body? I was already slipping away. I tried to concentrate, but the mind slid from my grip like nothing. The dizziness rose and rose. Worlds spun past, some made of geometric shapes in perfect balance, some made of foundations set subtly askew, waiting centuries for the right moment to collapse. We expanded into place, a silvery liquid coating a web, soaking each node with the gloss of clarity. Something wavered at the edge of memory, something this one would have called important, something merely human. And then it passed, fading into the innumerable stars.
