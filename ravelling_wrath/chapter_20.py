[????? Probably cut: It was time to move forward with my <em>other</em> plan.]

If I was going to spend time studying the past, I would need to get comfortable. I manifested a familiar reclining chair and sat down. I wasn't comfortable at first. An old wound bothered me. I shifted my position until it was more tolerable. My leg was cramped. I reclined the chair just right to let the leg relax. The skin on both legs itched where they had gotten warm from walking. I concentrated until the itch subsided.

Finally, my body stopped interrupting my thoughts.

The sun was glaring in my eyes. I had chosen an indoor spot to rest, but the sun shone through a window, and the reflection on the far wall was too bright. I manifested a folding divider wall between me and the reflection, but even the ambient light in the room was glaring in my eyes. I manifested a sleep mask to completely shut out the light. Somehow, even that didn't make it better. Belatedly, I realized what was really happening. It wasn't the physical light that was bothering me. It was the Blood God's presence. I wouldn't be able to shut <em>that</em> out. And given what I was about to do, I wouldn't even want to. It would be better if I could be aware of it, even if it was a strain. So I unmanifested the mask and wall. Instead of shutting out the bright light, I stared into it. I waited until every part of me stopped seeing it as a source of pain, and started seeing it as a point of reference.

And then, I began my task. I began to dig up the memories.


If I wanted to know more about the Blood Temple, I would have to search among my memories for what I might know and what I didn't. I stared into the light, searching my mind for any memories related to the Blood Temple. It was like something just on the edge of my mind, something I couldn't quite remember. The only memories that popped into my mind were subtly unrelated. Why couldn't I think of it? Clearly, many of the former Farseers had lived in a time when the Blood Temple was still active. Did I have memories from those years? I did. Did I have memories from Farseers who lived in the fifth layer of the city? I did. The main Blood Temple building would have been at the main square of the fifth layer. I had seen a picture of it, in an old book I had found in a back room of the Stern monastery. Could I picture a memory of that temple?

Slowly, an image formed into place. The wide front gateway, with the Burning Heart emblazoned at the top of its arch. Echoes of the deep pounding of its drums on its festival days. Flickering images of crowds gathered in celebration or rage.

Somehow, the Waiting God was making things more difficult. It wasn't actively resisting me, but perhaps it had modified the structure of these memories before it even gave them to me. Memories of the Blood Temple had not been <em>removed</em> – I could still remember them if I thought of them – but it was harder than usual to think of them. <em>Other</em> memories had a tendency to come to mind whenever they were relevant, like if I thought of something related. But these memories didn't. They only came when I looked for them specifically.

Something about this made me hesitate. If the Waiting God didn't want me to see these memories, why wouldn't it remove them entirely, the way it had entirely left out the two early Farseers who had murdered Blood Children on purpose? But on second thought, it made sense. Its highest priority would have been to keep me from noticing that anything was out of the ordinary. Missing memories could have created inconsistencies that I could notice. But just <em>not thinking of something</em> wouldn't raise any suspicion. And it was just like the Waiting God to do things this way, to use the smallest intervention necessary to accomplish its goals. Guidance rather than force.

I kept searching. It was a good thing that Rinn and I had made that list of all the Farseers, so that I could just go through the list and not worry that I might forget someone. Many of the Farseers had only known of the Blood Temple from a distance. A few were more promising. I recalled passing through this gateway as a childcare worker for the Temple, ?????. I recalled passing through this gateway as a farmer coming to stand in prayer for the health of my livestock. I recalled passing through this gateway as a lawyer, coming to argue a case in Blood court.  [????? Other examples]

Now I had some places to start. Next, I would have to decide who to focus on first. What was I really looking for here? I was looking for the truth about the Blood Temple, but what part of the truth? Was I looking for a Blood priest who knew how I could connect to my emotions? Was that the most important thing I could learn? If I thought about it… the most important thing was… I needed to find points where I fundamentally disagreed with the Waiting God. When part of me would become part of the god, I could not be doubtful. I could not be susceptible to seeing things in the way it did. The most Waiting part of myself would have to be utterly confident in rejecting its plan. And right now, it wasn't. I hated the god and its plan, but I had felt what it felt like to <em>be</em> the god. The god wouldn't take the part of me that hated it. It would take the part of me that saw everything from a distance, the part that coldly picked out the truth without caring how much it hurt. It was a part of me that <em>wouldn't</em> care if I had to suffer and die, and Rinn had to suffer and die, and hundreds of people had to suffer and die, if I had a goal that required it. And if the Waiting saw the destruction of the Blood God as a goal worthy of that… could I truly say that that part of me could never be convinced? I could not. And so I needed an answer on the level of the cold truth. A reason that the Blood God's destruction could never be my goal.

If I was looking for something I would find abhorrent… That gave me an obvious place to look:

<em>How did the Blood Temple fall?</em>

<bigbreak>

It was finally happening. The demolition had begun.

It was hard to see it in the grainy black-and-white of the television. I would have liked to be there to see that wretched structure destroyed with my own eyes. But there was a chance of riots by those Blood worshippers, and it would not do to spoil my retirement by getting caught in the violence. It was enough to know that it was happening.

I lay back in my bed as I watched the gateway crumble, clouds of white dust spreading into the air. Then the camera turned, giving a view of the milling crowd just as a few Blood supporters rushed out towards the police barricade. In moments, they were writhing on the ground – the Stern police had released a sorcery against them. I smiled. I was not a cruel man, but those fools had brought this on themselves.

I should never have taken that wretched case. But at least they were finally getting what they deserved.

This was perfect, ????? from the safety and comfort of my own bed. Even better that Eva was out of town, visiting a friend to "decompress". Probably to vent about me. But, at the very least, it meant that she wasn't here to nag me about wearing shoes in the bed. My shoes were <em>not</em> dirty. She never complained of a dirty bed when she didn't <em>see</em> me wearing them, so it was just another of her irrational –

As Yali, I pulled myself out of the memory. Many of the Farseers were tiresome to work with, and this lawyer was one of them. If I just let his memories go wherever they felt like, I would spend far too much time in his complaints about his wife. There was nothing wrong with his wife. She was an ordinary person with ordinary flaws, and I had no interest in his frustrations with her. But I had to work past them, because he had much more interesting things to remember.

He had thought of a <em>case</em>. A case he had been involved with as a lawyer, one that was related to the Blood Temple.

????? [????? Not sure of ordering:]

"Another six gone to Blood? What do we pay you for?!" he yelled, slamming his hand down on the files, spittle flying from his mouth.

I <em>could</em> have yelled back. But <em>I</em> chose to be professional. "Sir, there was nothing that could be done. [????? The Concord of Temples precedent]

?????

"Sir, I am not an expert in Blood law," I said. That was right, I had <em>told</em> him it wasn't my expertise! I had done <em>my</em> job perfectly, I had warned him, so everything that happened later was <em>his</em> fault for ignoring my advice! I had even said "[????? therefore I can't guarantee results] –"

As Yali, I typed out, <em>?????lawyer didn't understand blood law, <strong>believes</strong> he warned boss</em>. This memory contained the feeling of looking back and feeling justified. But it hadn't originally contained that feeling, and he wasn't still alive to add his own thoughts about it now. So the memory had already been rewritten to add it, while he was still alive. He had probably rewritten this memory many times, to cast himself in the best possible light.

?????

I read from the Book of Blood, of course, but I also had to cross-reference it with other ????? and historical accounts, because the Book of Blood [????? rambled about principles way more than it defined the rules].

But based on everything I read, it would be almost impossible to get these crimes prosecuted in Blood court. First of all, every case had to begin with an accusation of a <em>violation of blood</em>. That typically meant an attack against someone's physical body. There were exceptions, of course. A threat could be a violation of blood. Even an insult could be one, if it was degrading enough. And of particular interest to me, property crimes <em>could</em> be violations of blood [????? example]. You couldn't own an object you had never seen or touched.

But all of the goods that had been stolen were owned by ?????Corporation. And within ?????Corporation, the only people who have handled the goods before they were stolen were local employees. And there was clear precedent in historical negotiations between the temples. A theft couldn't be a violation of blood against the employees unless the employees were owners of the goods under Blood law. And the Blood Temple had agreed that whenever the Stern Temple classified goods as the assets of a corporation, it would <em>not</em> consider the employees their owners. Worse, this rule was a <em>concession</em> to be Stern Temple, because otherwise the employers <em>would</em> become Blood owners by virtue of being the only ones to handle the goods with their bodies, and then the Blood Temple would have to defend the employees' right to simply walk off with the merchandise. So, as a compromise, the Blood Temple considered corporate assets to be <em>unowned</em>. And therefore, stealing them could be prosecuted by the Stern Temple, but it could never be a violation of blood.

At least this kind of nonsense still had clear rules. It wasn't so different from Stern law, full of impossible situations created by historical compromises, from which it was my job to find ways out.

But there was worse. Even once there was a <em>violation of blood</em>, it wasn't necessarily a crime. Or, to be precise, it wasn't necessarily <em>lowari</em>. Blood law described four types of violation, and the Temple would only punish <em>lowari</em>, even though the distinctions between the types were subtle and subjective.

Blood law defined <em>lowari</em> as violations that <em>put one person above another</em>.

?????

But how did the Blood Temple determine what was ?????? According to the Book of Blood, the victims and the accused would meet in temple and "bare their hearts", and then "the blood of the city" would decide the truth. From what I could tell, this was nothing but a fancy way of saying that one of the Blood Temple's masked judges would question them and then make an arbitrary decision.

?????

If only there had <em>been</em> a trial. The judge's order at the pretrial hearing left it indefinitely postponed, and then –

What was this pretrial hearing, then?

[????? Physical descriptions, introduction to hearing]

[????? Lawyer seeing the accused at pretrial hearing, sexist thoughts] –

[????? The accused? The thief girl?] didn't look quite how I had imagined her. She came in nervously, holding herself upright, wearing a plain, conservative dress. She was almost pretty. But I could see her piercings, and as soon as she spoke, I could hear the vulgar way she talked. She was clearly fifth-layer trash. No doubt this was her <em>only</em> conservative dress, and she paraded around the streets in straps that barely covered up those oversized breasts – not that I paid attention to that. <em>I</em> was a professional, after all. When she entered, I shook her hand firmly, looking her steadily in the eye, and gave a polite –

I pulled myself out of the memory. I didn't care about this hearing – no, I did care about it, but I needed a break from this man. It wasn't even the sexual thoughts that bothered me – I had gotten used to the memories thinking sexual thoughts at inappropriate times, since it was common across almost all the Farseers, including myself. But ?????lawyer's hypocrisy – thinking degrading things, then congratulating himself for being a better person – it was getting into my head in a way I didn't like at all. I could get back to this hearing <em>later</em>. Maybe it would be easier if I viewed ?????'s memories in short bursts.

[????? Maybe the caretaker would be good for a break. What did he know that I wanted?]

<bigbreak>

Apparently, time has seen me become "the cool substitute teacher". I have always been told I have a way with children, and it would have made me happy if my stories of the old Blood Temple were what earned me that title. Happier still if it were the way I patiently listened to <em>their</em> stories of their lives. But [????? nowadays it took much less than that to make me "cool". It was because I didn't make them keep their heads down all day and study. So many of their parents are away in the car and computer factories nowadays, and they have cars now, but for what? It never seemed right to enforce the Stern rules on them]

"Mister!" one of them piped up. ?????

?????

Nowadays, kids only wanted to hear the gory details, about the orgies, the floggings. I suppose that kids have always asked about these things, because kids always do what kids do best, hunting after the highs and lows of life until they find their place in the world. But it used to be that there were another kind of questions, too. Ten years ago, there were kids who asked questions like "why aren't we allowed to say the Blood prayers anymore?" and "[????? something about how an older family member is affected socially/economically]". But for kids growing up today, the Blood Temple was just a part of history.

And what did I tell them? Yes, there were holy days when we hosted orgies. Yes, criminals who severely exploited people were sometimes stripped naked and flogged in the public square. But that wasn't what the Blood Temple was really about. And no, I couldn't tell them any stories about that, because Blood tradition forbade gossiping about someone's past punishment. No, I wouldn't violate Blood tradition just because the Blood Temple was gone now. There were reasons for how we did things. [????? After someone was punished, they needed to have the opportunity to return to equal. If you continued gossiping long after the event, you were stepping on them for your own amusement. That was <em>lowari</em>.]

No… none of that was what the Blood Temple was really about.

What a pity that most of these kids would have to grow much older before they would appreciate my fond memories of the hard work, the satisfying work of Blood. As I often did, I made a compromise, telling the hectic story of our work during the relief effort for Hurricane Fjarl –

No… as Yali, I didn't care what those kids from the past were interested in.

?????

[????? Narrated memory of caretaker comforting a sick boy all night]

As Yali, I ?????balked. Sure, it was a feel-good thing for him to do, but it didn't solve anything! What about the next time the boy was sick, when ?????caretaker might not be there? Someday, the boy would have to learn how to handle it on his own, and until then, this was just delaying the inevitable. But ?????caretaker felt like this was a beautiful success, a <em>holy</em> thing. What was so successful about it? I couldn't tell. This was frustrating. At least with the Waiting God, when I had trouble understanding it, I could <em>ask</em> what it thought about something, and then I could form new god-thoughts to get my answer. But with the memories, I just had to hope there was already a memory that explained it.

Well, I didn't need to know what <em>?????caretaker</em> thought was the best thing about the Blood Temple. ????? Maybe the right idea was to go over the story of Hurricane Fjarl after all. That would tell me how the Blood Temple handled a crisis [?????, which was much more important than this everyday stuff].

[????? Bunch of hurricane stuff, then some more of the lawyer?]


[????? Yali runs into "The same memory of the sick boy"; what was so important about that memory?]


?????

There was the memory of the sick boy again. The same fond memory of staying up all night just to comfort him.

I hesitated. If ?????Caretaker kept coming back to this memory, maybe there was something important in at after all. He was a thoughtful person, and even a bit of a cynic. He liked feel-good things, but not <em>this</em> much. So what was it?

This was unsettling. To <em>him</em>, it was so <em>obvious</em> why this would be a good formative experience for the boy.

[????? Yali hunts for the answer; it's basically "so that he grows up knowing that we care for each other and can rely on each other"]

In this world, you couldn't rely on anyone. You had to know how to take care of your own needs. I could feel an emptiness inside me, the sickness, the guilt, of every time I had been been hurt because I carelessly expected someone else to do what I needed without me checking it. Teaching kids that they could rely on anyone was just going to get them hurt! They would blunder into danger again and again and again until they were burned enough times to learn not to trust anyone else with their safety! And if the Blood God thought this was holy, the Blood God was letting it happen! It would be responsible for their suffering, for <em>my</em> suffering! [????? I was very angry; if kids didn't have to learn how to take care of themselves, everything I had worked for would be meaningless]

?????

It wasn't the truth about the world. It was the truth about a world <em>without the Blood Temple</em>. [????? The caretakers would have covered for my mother's problems, and I could have sheltered in the Temple from the ?????s]

[????? Everything I had worked for SHOULD have been meaningless]

[????? I cried a lot, I didn't know what to do]

 [????? Notes:
 
 Caretaker details: the Temple will protect children from their parents, reading from the book of blood to the children, "no one can be above or below another", traveling to the homes of the infirm for outreach

important concepts for this chapter: Blood policies have flaws but the capitalist replacement is even more destructive; technology could be used for good if Blood and Waiting worked together

Yali taking notes on her phone (maybe use paragraph I already wrote below)

Maybe main plot thread is caretaker's "maybe there will be a better world someday"? ("I liked teaching children about the Blood ways much better than I liked dealing with Temple politics – it lets me feel like someday people will actually live by these principles")

Yali doesn't want to engage with the caretaker's nice memories because she has anxiety about children being cared for instead of handling things on their own; the memories keep leading back to a nice memory and she's like "what's so important about this?"

Main plot thread is that Yali needs something she's confident in that the Waiting God isn't confident at denying, but she doesn't have something like that; at first Yali can only think of things where she can see both sides and can't 100% say the Blood God's way is right, but finally the caretaker's dream of a world where children are cared for is something she can (with emotional struggle) finally admit is 100% right, but the Waiting God feels contradictory things about

Yali switches lawyer->caretaker when the lawyer is being annoying and irrelevant, caretaker->lawyer because it's harder for Yali to work with the caretaker's memories because he's more Broken and less Stern "well this is nice, let me see where it goes" vs "This Is How Things Are Logically"

so
"I need to find a confident thing" "how did the blood temple fall"
lawyer section
"Ugh, well, the caretaker also remembers the fall", caretaker section where Yali doesn't listen well because she's still thinking about blood temple policy rather than caretaking
...
Yali realizes that caretaking is as important as policy

Waiting God connection restored, bits of its thoughts, some of them contradictory, like approving of the caretaker's dream for a better world

Have to include enough details of the mechanics of the fall of the Blood Temple (via both memories) – "blood Temple banned the company; that arguably violated Concord of Temples rules so the Stern were putatively allowed to protect company operations; Blood higher-ups arrested, some of those that remain jockey for position illegitimately, encouraged by the Stern, and undermine public trust in the blood Temple as a whole; Concord of Temples withdraws recognition and reassigns bottom two layers; Stern Temple seizes, repurposes or demolishes Blood temples, bans Blood worship and burns Blood books

Maybe the caretaker uses "praise the waiting"

]




I decided to investigate the lawyer first. The first thing I felt was his frustration and contempt for the Blood legal system. [????? Shouldn't there be examples of specific memories here?] In Stern court, you only needed to prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that a defendant had violated the law. I – the lawyer – had done that many times. There were many restrictions on the arguments you could make and the evidence you could present, to prevent unjust convictions, but if you studied the law, as I had, you could rely on them to obey consistent rules.

Not so much with Blood court. In Blood court, it wasn't enough for me to prove a violation of the <em>law</em> – I needed a violation of someone's <em>blood</em>. That was irritatingly vague and inconsistent. Obviously, it didn't only mean people's literal blood. Literal blood was the highest standard – any case of assault where the victim was bruised or their skin was broken would automatically count. And property crimes would <em>sometimes</em> count, because it was still considered a <em>violation of blood</em> if the victim experienced fear or insecurity as a result of the crime. But if you tried to get someone convicted for theft or vandalism of a storefront, even if they were the most contemptible repeat offender? Ha! You might as well try to convince a fish that it was wet.

I was sick of being assigned to cases in the fifth layer. Now, I was proud of my work – someone <em>else</em> in my position might give up, but I would never abandon a case that I could still win. Not infrequently, [????? I found a way to argue that part of the crime had happened in the fourth layer, which was officially shared between the Blood and Stern temples.]. If that was so, the case would have to be reviewed by the ????? – the body that governed what to do with crimes that crossed between the jurisdiction of multiple temples.
 ?????
 
I took a lot of notes on my phone, too. [????? I had gone to the trouble of keeping it assimilated in the Stern layer] I wasn't sure if I was going to keep any of the former Farseers' memories after I was brought back to the material world. I would <em>probably</em> still have my own memories of <em>remembering</em> the other memories, but I preferred not to rely on that if I didn't have to.




 ?????

And along with the portal, the others were already there. Alchemist and Morrow.

I would probably have liked Alchemist a lot better if I hadn't had to do so much work to stop them from getting themself killed. And I would have been able to tolerate Morrow a lot better if the Seeking God hadn't pointed the worst part of him directly at the one I loved. But the past cannot be changed.

I hesitated. Was it un-Blood for me to think that way? Well, not for Morrow, certainly. Hating someone who abused your loved ones was clearly a Blood thing to do. But Alchemist…

I breathed carefully, keeping myself calm. I cared about <em>Rinn</em>. And <em>Rinn</em> would want me to care about Alchemist. I was allowed to be frustrated with them, but I had a Blood reason to care about them, too.

I didn't like that, but I decided to go along with it. Now I just had to figure out what that would mean in practice.

I listened for the future. I felt myself walk towards the portal. I saw Morrow hurry towards me and speak to me, ask me questions. I felt myself lash out at him. I felt myself hold back. I felt countless fragments of anger and tension. I saw both of them step away from me, huddling quiet and scared at a distance. I saw us keep an uncomfortable truce until the time came to enter the portal.

This was not the future I would choose. I could do better.

I listened for a different future. I felt myself pretending to be calm, answering Morrow's questions so that Alchemist would think we had an understanding. I felt the futures where my frustration built up until I struck him again. I had enjoyed breaking his fingers the first time, and I could enjoy it again. But that wasn't what I was looking for. I listened for a future where I would navigate my feelings, where I could keep the illusion going and maintain the peace between us. I saw the three of us waiting together at the portal. I felt myself staring at the portal, feeling isolated, just concentrating on keeping myself calm while I waited for the end. This was not the future I would choose. I would not be ready to face the Waiting God if those were the feelings in my mind.

I listened for a different future. I knew that both of them were already afraid of me. I felt myself march towards the portal, determined to make them be the ones to suffer instead of me. When Morrow ran to meet me, I shouted him down. I ordered them both to be quiet and speak only to answer my questions. Finally, at the end of everything, I could <em>finally</em> just make them give me the peace and quiet I deserved. No more staying on good terms with Alchemist just in case we needed more potions. No more letting words come out of Morrow's disgusting face. I would finally just get what <em>I</em> wanted. And then I could face the Waiting God with pride. I would be the one who was in control.

As much as part of me liked that future, it was not the one I would choose either. I could still do better.

<bigbreak>

After a dozen more futures, I found the one that satisfied me. I forced myself to my feet, hefted the handle of Rinn's wagon, and headed for the portal.

Morrow approached me, as I had seen. I caught his hand, keeping it close between us, out of Alchemist's view. I looked in his eyes to make sure I could see the fear there. "Don't speak to me," I said quietly.

I let go of Morrow's hand. He backed away from me. This was going well.

I rolled the wagon close to the portal, where Alchemist was waiting. Alchemist nervously approached and looked at Rinn's head, the only part of her that was sticking out of the foam. Tears filled their eyes.

"Is, she… You used, the…"

"The second one we made," I said gently. "She was injured in the fight. But she will recover."

"Will she… that one was…"

Alchemist was trying to ask about the side effects of the potion. The sleeping effect was very powerful. If someone already had a weak soul when they drank it, they might never wake up. It was understandable that Alchemist would worry. In the futures, I had tried dozens of responses before I found one that would reassure them. "Examine her soul yourself," I said. "Feel how strong it is. I am completely confident in her."

Alchemist approached and nervously touched Rinn's head. Then they nodded and pulled back again.

Alchemist looked down over the city. I saw their eyes linger over the distant gouges among the buildings, where Justicar had fought us.

"She's not, coming, is she…"

"She's dead," I confirmed. "We couldn't convince her to stop." I waited for Alchemist to glance at Rinn, wondering if Rinn had been the one who killed her. I said the best thing I had found to assuage their worries. "We did it together."

"Oh. I guess, you had to do it…" Tears dripped down their face.

"I wish I could tell you something else."

"I know."

?????

"I believe I owe you a great deal," I said. "Your potions have saved Rinn's life more than once now. And possibly my life as well. If there's anything I can do for you in return, I'd like to do that."

"You don't, have, to –"

"It's okay. Just tell me if you think of anything."

[????? Alchemist physicality, short silence]

"There is, maybe, one thing… I know you, don't like, Morrow, but…"

"It's okay. Go on."

"Do you know if he'll…" Alchemist glanced towards the portal. "Since he's not… with the god…"

I concentrated, just like if I was using the Seeing. I already knew what I was going to say, but Alchemist would feel more reassured if it looked like I had checked.

"I believe he'll get back to the material world safely," I said. "Even though he can't be part of the rejuvenation, the process for returning the Ravellers to the material world is separate from that."

"Oh…" [????? Alchemist physicality, curling up/comfortable/with Morrow?]

I let them ?????relax for a little while, then added, "We can also exchange phone numbers, in case you think of anything I can do for you once we're in the material world. I won't have any magical abilities, but… people say I'm very capable." I pulled out my phone.

[????? Alchemist physicality] "I, didn't, have my phone, on me, when…"

In the future, Alchemist had also worried they'd be forgetful. If I just told them my number, they might not remember it. And if <em>they</em> told me <em>their</em> number, they might accidentally give me the wrong number. "Here's what we'll do," I said. "You can manifest a copy of your phone. It will have your phone number in it, so I can copy that number into my real phone. Then I'll call you once we get back to the material world. I won't be able to call right away, because I'll be taking care of Rinn, but I'll try to call within a day or two."

Alchemist nodded. They manifested their phone, and thumbed through it to find where it would show their number. "If I could, also, give this to, Morrow, and, Rinn…"

I carefully copied Alchemist's number. "Morrow and Rinn both lost their real phones in the Stern God's world. But the real phones will still go back to the material world with them. So I can write down Morrow's number and then text it to you, and for Rinn, I can –"

Alchemist flinched a bit. They had realized, based on what I said, that I wasn't willing to let Morrow know <em>my</em> number. I was trying not to force Alchemist to think about the conflict between us, but it would have been easier if Alchemist wasn't so smart.

"– For Rinn, I can give Rinn <em>your</em> number. I could give hers to you, I assume she'd be okay with that, but I just –" I carefully kept any hint of resentment out of my voice. This wasn't about Morrow. "– I just want to make sure to respect everyone's boundaries."

"I, understand."
