"Oh, uh, hi, Alchemist," I said awkwardly.

Alchemist kept clinging to the other side of the ladder. It was as if they thought they could hide from me, even though I could obviously see them right through it.

"It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you! It's the Seeking God! It just – it absolutely fucked me over!" I raged. Alchemist seemed to shrink even further away from me, if that were possible. Right, Alchemist was really sensitive. I couldn't just <em>tell</em> them I wasn't mad at them, I had to <em>act</em> in a gentler way too. It was grating to have to do that right after what the gGod just did to me. But I really didn't want to hurt Alchemist, and as far as the "finding Yali" thing went, I was basically fucked either way.

Belatedly, I turned my bleeding blade back into a regular arm. I had just been waving it in Alchemist's general direction, hadn't I. Stern take it all.

"I'm really not mad at you," I said, forcing myself to sound calmer. I opened my arms, making sure they both had regular human hands on them. "It's okay. You can come out now."

Alchemist didn't come out from behind the ladder.

"Okay, fine, I'll just, uh, wait over here until you're ready," I said. I sat down on a rock a fair distance away and started idly kicking at the sand with my foot.

[????? Description of this physical environment?]

"You're – you're definitely not going to hurt me?" said Alchemist tentatively, poking their head out from around the ladder.

"Of course not! I'd never hurt <em>you</em>, you're – you're adorable!"

Alchemist giggled a little.

?????

"So, what <em>is</em> this place?" I asked. "It doesn't look like the rest of the Endless Maze." Most of this world had been made out of tiny rooms and twisty passageways, with puzzles hidden behind every corner. But right now, we were in the middle of a big landscape, stretching out in all directions. If it wasn't for the ladders sticking up everywhere, it would look completely normal.

"It doesn't…?"

"Yeah, this just doesn't seem like the Seeking God at all. It's more like…" I looked around at the endless sand and stones. There was kind of a sense of emptiness here, like an incomplete world. "…more like the Broken? Wait, did <em>you</em> do something to this part of the world?"

"I… maybe?" said Alchemist doubtfully.

"Or, wait, what if the <em>Seeking</em> makes different puzzles for each of us? Justicar's puzzles had rigid rules, too. I mean, the rules were a trick, but it was still <em>based on</em> rules ?????

?????

[????? Rinn climbs a ladder]

From the top of the ladder, I took a good look around. I couldn't see <em>that</em> far, though. There was a sort of gray fog keeping me from seeing too far in any direction. I strained my eyes, but it was no use. So I looked back down at the stuff around us.

Below me, Alchemist picked up a smooth rock the size of their hand, rubbed it a little, then put it back down in a different place. Then they did the same thing with another rock. Satisfied, they stepped back to look at their work. It looked like they were arranging the rocks in a pretty pattern, with lots of curves and spirals. Looking further, I could see that there was a long stretch of rocks that were arranged in the same pattern, going off into the fog in one direction. Maybe Alchemist had been coming from that direction when I showed up.

I jumped down from the ladder. "Why are you putting the rocks like that? I mean, it looks nice, but is there a reason for it?"

"I… don't know? It just, felt, like, something."

"Well, it's cool that you're doing it!" Why was I saying that? I looked down at the pattern. [????? Alchemist was barefoot, wearing clothes that looked loose and comfy] I kicked off my own shoes – well, technically, I swung my leg while unmanifesting my shoes – and walked barefoot on the land. The sand felt [????? good] between my toes. Even the stones were mostly smooth enough to be comfortable to walk on. It felt like they were giving a firm massage to the soles of my feet.

I cheerfully jumped down into a sitting position next to Alchemist. "So, how do you come up with these designs?" I said, picking up one of the stones to look at it. Alchemist flinched. "Oh, uh, was I not supposed to touch that? Let me just put it back." Luckily, I remembered where to put it back. I tried to make more conversation with Alchemist, but they seemed reluctant. "I could give you some space! I mean, if that's what you'd like –"

"I… maybe?" I could tell they were uncomfortable, but I couldn't tell whether they were uncomfortable about saying no or uncomfortable about saying yes, Stern take it. Whatever. I wanted to check this place out anyway, see if there was any more interesting landmarks behind the fog.

"I'll be back soon." I manifested the map. "If I get lost in the fog, I'll just go towards the Cloven Earth." That was the Broken God's symbol, indicating where Alchemist was. "I mean, unless the Seeking God messes with me. But apparently, the Seeking God can mess with me whenever the fuck it wants, so it doesn't make a difference, does it," I said irritably. "So yeah, uh… see you soon."

I walked off into the fog, my bare feet rubbing over the sand and stones. The further I walked, the more the cool, damp mist settled on my skin. I kept heading straight in one direction for a while, hoping to find something different. But there was just more sand and stones and ladders. Every so often, I paused to climb up one of the ladders. Climbing up and down was a satisfying workout, but it was still no different than before.

Before long, I was bored. I headed back towards Alchemist. I was half expecting to get lost in a magical fog maze, but it just worked normally. Soon, the dark shape of Alchemist loomed out of the gray mist.

"Hey Alchemist, where's the puzzle? I mean, this is the Endless Maze, there's gotta be a puzzle somewhere in here, right –"

Alchemist startled and dropped the rock they were holding.

?????

"It's, okay? We can, talk, I guess?"

We sat down next to each other on a big rock. Alchemist reached out hesitantly and held my hand, weaving their fingers in between mine. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but their hand was warm and soft, so that much was pleasant. But I felt like there was still a big tension between us. I wanted to say something nice, but I couldn't think of what to say. What was Alchemist even interested in? "Uh… so, what are you interested in?" I said.

"I don't know…"

"What do you do in your spare time?"

"I… maybe… I used to feed… pigeons? Before…" Alchemist shrugged. Well, at least I could tell what that shrug meant. It meant <em>before I got yanked out of my life by the god</em>.

"I'm sorry. It must be hard for you, having the gods pull you out of your life all of a sudden." Alchemist stiffened. "

?????

"Look," I said, "I can tell you're not comfortable around me."

Alchemist cringed.

"No, it's okay. I get it, I haven't exactly been, like, a really nice person. I've swung swords around and shit, I totally understand it if that makes you, like, nervous or anything. I just, like, want to get it out in the open, you know? I just can't stand leaving things like this, with us just dancing around it."

"Well – um –"

"Go on, do your worst."

Alchemist leaned into my shoulder. Hesitantly, they said, "I, maybe, Justicar said you're dangerous…"

"Oh for fuck's sake –" I began. Then I caught myself and make sure to settle down a bit before I said anything stupid. "Look, she's got her, like, <em>opinions</em> about stuff. But I'm really not going to hurt you. And if she was going on about the whole Blood Child and Farseer thing, there is no <em>fucking way</em> – er, there is no way I'm going to hurt Yali either. I'm really not."

"Oh…" said Alchemist. They sounded pretty disappointed. I was starting to get the idea that when Alchemist said "oh" like that, it didn't really mean they understood something. It meant they just didn't feel like pushing anymore.

"Look, it's okay. If you've got a problem with me, I want to hear about it. Just spit it out, don't leave me hanging."

Alchemist swallowed. They wobbled back and forth, trying to psych themselves up. Finally, they spoke.

"Are… you… going to hurt Morrow?"

Well, fuck.

"He's not here right now, is he?" Ugh, that was a stupid thing to say. Alchemist obviously meant in general, not right now. "I mean, I don't <em>want</em> to hurt anybody! I'm not going to hurt him if he doesn't hurt anybody else!" I said defensively.

"I… saw…" Alchemist moved the hand that wasn't holding mine, and ran their fingers wavily through the sand. Around the fingers, the sand formed into a picture – Morrow's face, with a hand print on it where I'd slapped him. "It was smaller than his hand… so it must have been you…" Alchemist said mournfully.

"Right, you would've seen that…" I said awkwardly. "So, what happened is, we tried trading phones when he was, <em>you know</em>, but then he freaked out and smashed mine. So, I was mad. But it was only for a moment! And it's not like I injured him or anything –" Ugh, I could already feel I was doing a bad job of this. If I wanted to reassure <em>Alchemist</em>, I'd have to come up with something better than saying <em>it could have been worse</em>. "I promise not to hurt him if he doesn't hurt anyone else."

"He might…" said Alchemist sadly. "He might hurt… somebody else. Will you hurt him then?"

"You're wiser than I thought," I said. Alchemist seemed not to like thinking about painful things, so I had kind of expected that they would just avoid bringing it up. But, fuck, they sure knew how to ask the hard questions. I sighed. "I, like, I can't promise it'll <em>never</em> happen, but, I guess… Even if he's hurting someone, I promise I'll try everything else I can think of first. Like, I'll, I don't know, just try to block him, or whatever. I promise."

"Thanks…" Alchemist clearly wasn't <em>completely</em> satisfied, but they sounded sincere. Tentatively, they put their arms around me. Their hug was warm and gentle, lumpy in some places and bony in others. I hugged them back. And then, abruptly, they went limp, collapsing half their weight onto my shoulders.

I quickly adjusted so I could hold them up. "Woah, are you okay there?!"

Alchemist had tears streaming down their face. "Mama, Papa, Bubele, Niemah…" they sobbed. They kept crying and saying more names, probably all the people they had left behind on Earth.

"Hey, hey, it's okay. We'll get you back to everyone safe and sound." I squeezed them tight.

"But I'm so… I'm so…"

"Sad?"

Alchemist nodded. "And…"

"Scared?"

They nodded again. "And…"

"Lonely?"

Another nod.

"Well, I'm here!" I said cheerfully. Alchemist giggled despite themself.


?????

Traveling with Alchemist was oddly comforting.

After a while, it had finally sunk in that I was never going to find Yali anytime soon. I had felt defeated, bitter, like there was a yawning hole in me, an empty space where ????? should have been. But then Alchemist came and… <em>filled</em> some of that space. I didn't understand how, but somehow, it was easier to just focus on what I was doing with Alchemist than to worry about the gods. The gentle resonance of their voice was almost enough to distract me.

The weirdest thing was the world around us.

"Seriously, what's up with there not being any puzzles here?" I said one day. We had been wandering aimlessly through foggy landscapes for ages, only pausing occasionally to manifest a place to rest. It didn't seem like the rest of the Endless Maze at all.

"I think, maybe, there are? If you just, wait, and, let them come to you?"

"What the – I mean, what do you mean by that?"

"One time, I, was lying down, and I saw, a shape? In the ladders, the light shining through the ladders. And then I made the shape, with the stones. And then, it gave me another shape…"

"Did that lead to something?"

"I forgot one of the shapes…"

"Oh."

"It's okay. Maybe it'll come back later."

?????
I sat up in bed. Near me, Alchemist ?????

"I heard Morrow call you Raylie earlier, is that your name?"

"It's, uh, short for Raline," said Alchemist awkwardly.

"Should I call you that? I mean, calling you Alchemist all the time just feels so… cold and formal," I said.

Alchemist shrugged. "You can call me whatever you like."

"Okay, uh…" They'd technically given me permission, but calling them Raline just didn't feel right. They hadn't told me that name willingly, and they didn't really seem enthusiastic about it now. For all I knew, they didn't even want <em>Morrow</em> to know that name! Morrow could have just read it out of their mind somehow, and started using it without asking. Or with asking. I got the impression that Alchemist wasn't very comfortable saying no to things. "Look, you're allowed to say no to me if you don't want me to. I won't bite."

That made Alchemist look even more uncomfortable, Stern take it.

"So, uh, you know how Morrow can read your mind all the time?"

Alchemist smiled involuntarily.

"Hang on, is he reading your mind right now?!"

"No… We're too far away, he can only smell and, touch, my feelings, from here…" they said sadly.

"So… are you, like, okay with that? With him reading your mind?"

"It's <em>wonderful</em>." Alchemist's face lit right up, and their voice turned all relaxed and dreamy. "He always knows what I want. I never have to figure it out myself when he's around. He makes me so <em>happy</em>." Alchemist giggled a little. It was so cute.

"Hang on, you normally have to figure out what you want? How do you not know what you want?"

"I, just, don't know? I, how do other people know what they want?"

"I mean, I just want things. What does it mean to want something without knowing what it is?"

"Oh…" sighed Alchemist disappointedly. They had such an expressive, emotional face. When they were happy, they looked totally blissful, and when they were sad, they looked like just the saddest thing <em>ever</em>. I just wanted to hug them forever.

"Do you want a hug?" I said.

We both moved in for a hug awkwardly, bumping our arms into each other.

Alchemist  [????? More description]

When we pulled away, 

?????

[????? More time passing]

[????? Rinn cuddling with Alchemist]

Ugh, why did the Seeking have to stick me with Alchemist? I felt like I was having to suppress my feelings all the time. And sure, I had to suppress some of my feelings with Yali, too, but at least Yali let me <em>be</em> angry, just as long as it wasn't at <em>her</em>.

That was the problem – I liked Alchemist, but they just… <em>weren't Yali</em>. Even right now, I was comfortable enough here cuddling with Alchemist in the soft cushions I'd made, but it just wasn't the same. If only I had Yali here [????? physical fantasies].

I drifted out my daydream to find that I was nuzzling up beside Alchemist's head, practically brushing my lips against their neck. I pulled back sharply. "I'm not – I didn't mean –"

Alchemist sleepily laid an arm over my shoulders and tugged me back towards them.

"I didn't mean to be so – intimate – I'm with Yali! I mean – we're poly, I guess –" Heat rose in my cheeks. Alchemist's big eyes drifted close to my face. "I mean, I don't like you in <em>that way</em> –" I gently pulled away again. Alchemist looked [????? sad about that, slightly reluctant to let me go]. "Wait – do <em>you</em> – how do you, uh, feel about me?"

"I don't, know?"

Uncertainly, I allowed Alchemist to pull me closer to them again. They laid their head beside mine, rubbing our cheeks together.

<em>Fuck.</em>

I <em>did</em> like Alchemist in <em>that way</em>.

My feelings were a huge mess. It wasn't supposed to be Alchemist here, it was supposed to be Yali! But the gentle pressure on my cheek told a different story. My heart wanted to sink into Alchemist, to leave the rest of my worries behind. I wasn't even sure if I liked them for themselves or if I was just trying to pretend they were Yali. And I didn't know which was worse. If I just used them as a temporary substitute for Yali, that would make me an asshole! But if I pulled away, then… I'd be… so alone…

Tears came into my eyes. I clung to Alchemist, clutching at the soft back of their [????? top] helplessly.

?????

[????? Rinn still tearful:] "What will Morrow think? About us, uh, being like this?"

"Morrow won't mind."

I was surprised by how confident Alchemist sounded. I had pretty much been expecting that they would just say <em>I don't know</em> again. "Are you really sure about that?"

"I can feel, what, Morrow wants? He likes it when I'm, happy. Like this." Alchemist smiled involuntarily.

"Woah, so, you're actually happy?"

"I, I guess I am?" said Alchemist happily.

"Well, uh –" I said uncomfortably. I really didn't want to lead Alchemist into expecting something that wasn't going to happen. "So, you know, right, just so you know, when I'm back with Yali, I don't know if I'll want to keep, you know…"

"I know," said Alchemist.

?????

[????? The Blood God being impatient, making Rinn impatient with Alchemist]

[????? we came to a gorge]

[????? More impatience spilling out]

"I didn't mean that," I said through gritted teeth. "Look, I'm going to, uh, <em>go</em>. Like, for a walk."

It hurt me to leave Alchemist on that sour note, but with all the thundering impatience in my head, I couldn't get myself to say anything nicer either. I stood up and stomped off before I could make things worse.

Not sure where to go, I picked out one of the roads that went down the side of the gorge. As I walked through the cold, damp air, it took me zigzagging back and forth, down and down into the gorge, until the fog was too thick to see my way back up.

As I walked, I thought about ?????

?????. If only I didn't have the Blood God looking over my shoulder all the time.

"You are <em>not me</em>," I shouted into the void. "I don't care what you want! I don't care about your fucking murder quest! And I'm sick of you trying to take away my chance to enjoy being with Alchemist when there's nothing we can even do anyway! And so, I am going to go back up there, and be everything Alchemist wants me to be! I will treat them like an absolute princess! I mean, a… whatever the non-binary equivalent of princess is! A prince… uh… whatever, actually even if they were a dude I'd still say I was going to treat them like a princess! So that's what I'm going to do! You hear me?!"

?????

– there she was!

Two tides of feeling surged within me. Finally, <em>finally</em>, after so many days, she was here again! Inside me, there was a struggle for control, between the part that wanted to run and hug her and the part that wanted to charge and rip her to pieces. But I knew which part was me and which wasn't. I bore down on the second part with all my will, and it wavered. Grinning triumphantly, I stomped it down. <em>Stay in your corner, Blood God,</em> I thought loudly. <em>I am going to love Yali, and cherish her, and give her all the care and respect she deserves, no matter what you make me feel. And if you think you can make me lift a finger to hurt her, you're stupider than I thought.</em>

I felt the rage inside me subside. It was like the Blood God had given up and decided to sulk instead. <em>Yeah, that's what I thought.</em>

?????

Yali looked at me seriously. "You've gotten the Blood God's attention."

I smirked. "?????"

"No, that's very bad. I had hoped that we could get through the whole Ravelling without the Blood God being aware of how actively you were resisting it. But now… I can feel it. Things are shifting. I think it's going to try something. And the other gods are starting to notice a change, too."

?????

"So, uh… me and Alchemist… we kinda –"

"I know."

"You do?"

"Future, remember?" She smirked a little. She looked around to make sure the others weren't paying attention, then muttered, "I even did a future where I told you and them to kiss in front of me. It was, was, kinda hot."

"WHAAAAAAAAT???"
