"Oh, uh, hi, Alchemist," I said awkwardly.

Alchemist kept clinging to the other side of the ladder. It was as if they thought they could hide from me, even though I could obviously see them right through it.

"It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you! It's the Seeking God! It just – it absolutely fucked me over!" I raged. Alchemist seemed to shrink even further away from me, if that were possible. Right, Alchemist was really sensitive. ?????

Belatedly, I turned my bleeding blade back into a regular arm.

?????

"You're – you're definitely not going to hurt me?" said Alchemist tentatively, poking their head out from around the ladder.

"Of course not! I'd never hurt <em>you</em>, you're – you're adorable!"

Alchemist giggled a little.

?????

"Look," I said, "I can tell there's something [????? you're not comfortable with about me]."

Alchemist cringed.

"No, it's okay. I totally understand it if ?????. ?????. I just, like, want to get it out in the open, you know? I just can't stand leaving things like this, with us dancing around it all the time."

"Well – er –"

"Go on, do your worst."

"I, maybe, Justicar said you're dangerous…" they said hesitantly.

"Oh for fuck's sake –" I began. Then I caught myself and make sure to settle down a bit before I put my foot in it again. "Look, she's got her, like, <em>opinions</em> about stuff. But I'm really not going to hurt you. And if she was going on about the whole Blood Child and Farseer thing, there is no <em>fucking way</em> – er, there is no way I'm going to hurt Yali either. I'm really not."

"Oh…" said Alchemist. They sounded pretty disappointed. I was starting to get the idea that when Alchemist said "oh" like that, it didn't really mean they understood something. It meant they just didn't feel like pushing anymore.

"Look, it's okay. If you've got a problem with me, I want to hear about it. Just spit it out, don't leave me hanging."

Alchemist swallowed. They shifted back and forth, trying to psych themselves up. Finally, they spoke.

"Are… you… going to hurt Morrow?"

Well, fuck.

"He's not here right now, is he?" Ugh, that was a stupid thing to say. Alchemist obviously meant in general, not right now. "I mean, I don't <em>want</em> to hurt anybody! I'm not going to hurt him if he doesn't hurt anybody else!" I said defensively.

"I… saw…" Alchemist ran their fingers wavily through the sand. [????? Set up whether they are sitting or standing?] Around the fingers, the sand formed into a picture – Morrow's face, with a hand print on it where I'd slapped him. "It was smaller than his hand… So it must have been you…" they said sadly.

"Right, you would've seen that…" I said awkwardly. "So, what happened is, we tried trading phones when he was, you know, but then he freaked out and smashed mine. So, I was mad. But it was only for a moment! And it's not like I injured him or anything –" Ugh, I could already feel I was doing a bad job of this. If I wanted to reassure <em>Alchemist</em>, I'd have to come up with something better than saying "it could have been worse". ????? "I promise not to hurt him if he doesn't hurt anyone else."

"He might…" said Alchemist sadly. "He might hurt… somebody else. Will you hurt him then?"

"You're wiser than I thought," I said. I had kind of been assuming that [????? they would just avoid thinking about anything that hurt]. But, fuck, they sure knew how to ask the hard questions. I sighed. "I, like, I can't promise it'll <em>never</em> happen, but, I guess… Even if he's hurting someone, I promise I'll try everything else I can think of ?????"

"Thanks…" Alchemist clearly wasn't <em>completely</em> satisfied, but ?????

?????

"So, what <em>is</em> this place?" I asked. "It doesn't look like the rest of the Endless Maze."[????? Description? The only weird thing was the ladders]

?????


"I heard Morrow call you Raylie earlier, is that your name?"

"It's, uh, short for Raline," said Alchemist awkwardly.

"Should I call you that? I mean, calling you Alchemist all the time just feels so… cold and formal," I said.

Alchemist shrugged. "You can call me whatever you like."

"Okay, uh…" They'd technically given me permission, but calling them Raline just didn't feel right. They hadn't told me that name willingly, and they didn't really seem enthusiastic about it now. For all I knew, they didn't even want <em>Morrow</em> to know that name! Morrow could have just read it out of their mind somehow, and started using it without asking. Or with asking. I got the impression that Alchemist wasn't very comfortable saying no to things. "Look, you're allowed to say no to me if you don't want me to. I won't bite."

That made Alchemist look even more uncomfortable, Stern take it.

"So, uh, you know how Morrow can read your mind all the time?"

Alchemist smiled involuntarily.

"Hang on, is he reading your mind right now?!"

"No… We're too far away, he can only smell and, touch, my feelings, from here…" they said sadly.

"So… are you, like, okay with that? With him reading your mind?"

"It's <em>wonderful</em>." Alchemist's face lit right up, and their voice turned all relaxed and dreamy. "He always knows what I want. I never have to figure it out myself when he's around. He makes me so <em>happy</em>." Alchemist giggled a little. It was so cute.

"Hang on, you normally have to figure out what you want? How do you not know what you want?"

"I, just, don't know? I, how do other people know what they want?"

"I mean, I just want things. What does it mean to want something without knowing what it is?"

"Oh…" sighed Alchemist disappointedly. They had such an expressive, emotional face. When they were happy, they looked totally blissful, and when they were sad, they looked like just the saddest thing <em>ever</em>. I just wanted to hug them forever.

"Do you want a hug?" I said.

We both moved in for a hug awkwardly, bumping our arms into each other.

Alchemist was warm and gentle, lumpy in some places and bony in others. [????? More description]

When we pulled away, Alchemist had tears streaming down their face. "Mama, Papa, Bubele, Niemah…" they sobbed. They kept crying and saying more names, probably all the people they had left behind on Earth.

"Hey, hey, it's okay. We'll get you back to everyone safe and sound." I hugged them again.
