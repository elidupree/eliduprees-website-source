"I heard Morrow call you Raylie earlier, is that your name?"

"It's, uh, short for Raline," said Alchemist awkwardly.

"Should I call you that? I mean, calling you Alchemist all the time just feels so… cold and formal," I said.

Alchemist shrugged. "You can call me whatever you like."

"Okay, uh…" They'd technically given me permission, but calling them Raline just didn't feel right. They hadn't told me that name willingly, and they didn't really seem enthusiastic about it now. For all I knew, they didn't even want <em>Morrow</em> to know that name! Morrow could have just read it out of their mind somehow, and started using it without asking. Or with asking. I got the impression that Alchemist wasn't very comfortable saying no to things. "Look, you're allowed to say no to me if you don't want me to. I won't bite."

That made Alchemist look even more uncomfortable, Stern take it.

"So, uh, you know how Morrow can read your mind all the time?"

Alchemist smiled involuntarily.

"Hang on, is he reading your mind right now?!"

"No… We're too far away, he can only smell and, touch, my feelings, from here…" they said sadly.

"So… are you, like, okay with that? With him reading your mind?"

"It's <em>wonderful</em>." Alchemist's face lit right up, and their voice turned all relaxed and dreamy. "He always knows what I want. I never have to figure it out myself when he's around. He makes me so <em>happy</em>." Alchemist giggled a little. It was so cute.

"Hang on, you normally have to figure out what you want? How do you not know what you want?"

"I, just, don't know? I, how do other people know what they want?"

"I mean, I just want things. What does it mean to want something without knowing what it is?"

"Oh…" sighed Alchemist disappointedly. They had such an expressive, emotional face. When they were happy, they looked totally blissful, and when they were sad, they looked like just the saddest thing <em>ever</em>. I just wanted to hug them forever.

"Do you want a hug?" I said.

We both moved in for a hug awkwardly, bumping our arms into each other.

Alchemist was warm and gentle, lumpy in some places and bony in others. [????? More description]

When we pulled away, Alchemist had tears streaming down their face. "Mama, Papa, Bubele, Neemah…" they sobbed. They kept crying and saying more names, probably all the people they had left behind on Earth.

"Hey, hey, it's okay. We'll get you back to everyone safe and sound." I hugged them again.
