"Oh, uh, hi, Alchemist," I said awkwardly.

Alchemist kept clinging to the other side of the ladder. It was as if they thought they could hide from me, even though I could obviously see them right through it.

"It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you! It's the Seeking God! It just – it absolutely fucked me over!" I raged. Alchemist seemed to shrink even further away from me, if that were possible. Right, Alchemist was really sensitive. I couldn't just <em>tell</em> them I wasn't mad at them, I had to <em>act</em> in a gentler way too. It was grating to have to do that right after what the god just did to me. But I really didn't want to hurt Alchemist, and as far as the "finding Yali" thing went, I was basically fucked either way.

Belatedly, I turned my bleeding blade back into a regular arm. I had just been waving it in Alchemist's general direction, hadn't I. Stern take it all.

"I'm really not mad at you," I said, forcing myself to sound calmer. I opened my arms, making sure they both had regular human hands on them. "It's okay. You can come out now."

Alchemist didn't come out from behind the ladder.

"Okay, fine, I'll just, uh, wait over here until you're ready," I said. I sat down on a big rock a fair distance away and started irritably kicking at the sand with my foot.

It really <em>was</em> just sand and rocks around us. The rocks came in all sizes – there was everything from tiny pebbles to huge round balls of rock, half-sunk into the sand but still as tall as we were. And scattered randomly among the rocks, there was the occasional ladder – all looking like some sort of cheap, translucent plastic, and all sticking up straight out of the ground into the air.

"You're – you're definitely not going to hurt me?" said Alchemist tentatively, poking their head out from around their ladder.

"Of course not! I'd never hurt <em>you</em>, you're – you're adorable!"

Alchemist giggled a little. A little at a time, they moved out from behind the ladder. Their mouth moved slightly, as if they were trying to say something, but eventually they stopped and we just stood there awkwardly.

I tried to make conversation. "So, what <em>is</em> this place?" I asked. "It doesn't look like the rest of the Endless Maze." Most of this world had been made out of tiny rooms and twisty passageways, with puzzles hidden behind every corner. But right now, we were in the middle of a big landscape, stretching out in all directions. If it wasn't for the ladders sticking up everywhere, it would look completely normal.

"It doesn't…?"

"Yeah, this just doesn't seem like the Seeking God at all. It's more like…" I looked around at the endless sand and stones. There was kind of a sense of emptiness here, like an incomplete world. "…more like the Broken? Wait, did <em>you</em> do something to this part of the world?"

"I… maybe?" said Alchemist doubtfully.

"Or, wait, what if the <em>Seeking</em> makes different puzzles for each of us? Justicar's puzzles had rigid rules, too. I mean, the rules were a trick, but it was still <em>based on</em> rules, it was, like, built for someone who liked the <em>idea</em> of rules…" Ugh, thinking back to that was going to make me mad. I needed something to do to keep me busy, and Alchemist wasn't really helping with that.

I climbed one of the ladders. It was about twice as tall as I was. I sprang upwards. When I got to the top, I straddled the top rung and wove my legs in between the other rungs for balance.

From the top of the ladder, I took a good look around. I couldn't see <em>that</em> far, though. There was a sort of gray fog keeping me from seeing too far in any direction. I strained my eyes, but it was no use. So I looked back down at the stuff around us.

Below me, Alchemist picked up a smooth rock the size of their hand, rubbed it a little, then put it back down in a different place. Then they did the same thing with another rock. Satisfied, they stepped back to look at their work. It looked like they were arranging the rocks in a pretty pattern, with lots of curves and spirals. Looking further, I could see that there was a long stretch of rocks that were arranged in the same pattern, going off into the fog in one direction. Maybe Alchemist had been coming from that direction when I showed up.

I jumped down from the ladder. "Why are you putting the rocks like that? I mean, it looks nice, but is there a reason for it?"

"I… don't know? It just, felt, like, something."

"Well, it's cool that you're doing it!" Why was I saying that? I looked down at the pattern. Then I promptly got distracted by noticing Alchemist's feet. Alchemist was barefoot on the fine sand, wearing a loose robe that came down to their ankles. It looked soft and warm and comfy. I kicked off my own shoes – well, technically, I swung my leg while unmanifesting my shoes – and walked barefoot on the land. The sand felt good between my toes. Even the stones were mostly smooth enough to be comfortable to walk on. It felt like they were giving a firm massage to the soles of my feet.

I cheerfully jumped down into a sitting position next to Alchemist. "So, how do you come up with these designs?" I said, picking up one of the stones to look at it. Alchemist flinched. "Oh, uh, was I not supposed to touch that? Let me just put it back." Luckily, I remembered where to put it back. I tried to make more conversation with Alchemist, but they seemed reluctant. "I could give you some space! I mean, if that's what you'd like –"

"I… maybe?" I could tell they were uncomfortable, but I couldn't tell whether they were uncomfortable about saying no or uncomfortable about saying yes, Stern take it. Whatever. I wanted to check this place out anyway, to see if there was anything behind the fog that would get us back closer to the others.

"I'll be back soon." I summoned the map. "If I get lost in the fog, I'll just go towards the Cloven Earth." That was the Broken God's symbol, indicating where Alchemist was. "I mean, unless the Seeking God messes with me. But apparently, the Seeking God can mess with me whenever the fuck it wants, so it doesn't make a difference, does it." I scowled. "So yeah, uh… see you soon."

I walked off into the fog, my bare feet rubbing over the sand and stones. The further I walked, the more the cool, damp mist settled on my skin. I kept heading straight in one direction for a while, hoping to find something different. But there was just more sand and stones and ladders. Every so often, I paused to climb up one of the ladders. Climbing up and down was a satisfying workout, but it was still no different than before.

Before long, I was bored. I headed back towards Alchemist. I was half expecting to get lost in a magical fog maze, but it just worked normally. Soon, the dark shape of Alchemist loomed out of the gray mist.

"Hey Alchemist, where's the puzzle? I mean, this is the Endless Maze, there's gotta be a puzzle somewhere in here, right –"

Alchemist startled and dropped the rock they were holding.

"Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to disturb you, I just thought, we could talk about, uh…" I stood there stupidly.

"It's, okay? We can, talk, I guess?"

We sat down next to each other on a big rock. Alchemist reached out hesitantly and held my hand, weaving their fingers in between mine. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but their hand was warm and soft, so that much was pleasant. But I felt like there was still a big tension between us. I wanted to say something nice, but I couldn't think of what to say. What was Alchemist even interested in? "Uh… so, what are you interested in?" I said.

"I don't know…"

"What do you do in your spare time?"

"I… maybe… I used to feed… pigeons? Before…" Alchemist shrugged. Well, at least I could tell what that shrug meant. It meant <em>before I got yanked out of my life by the god</em>.

"I'm sorry. It must be hard for you, having the gods pull you out of your life all of a sudden." Alchemist stiffened. "Sorry! I didn't mean to make you remember anything traumatic!"

[????? "If, you, want, to, talk, about, –"]



?????

"It's, okay, –"

"Look," I said, "I can tell you're not comfortable around me."

Alchemist cringed.

"No, it's okay. I get it, I haven't exactly been, like, a really nice person. I've swung swords around and shit, I totally understand it if that makes you, like, nervous or anything. I just, like, want to get it out in the open, you know? I just can't stand leaving things like this, with us just dancing around it."

"Well – um –"

"Go on, do your worst."

Alchemist leaned into my shoulder. Hesitantly, they said, "I, maybe, Justicar said you're dangerous…"

"Oh for fuck's sake –" I began. Then I caught myself and make sure to settle down a bit before I said anything stupid. "Look, she's got her, like, <em>opinions</em> about stuff. But I'm really not going to hurt you. And if she was going on about the whole Blood Child and Farseer thing, there is no <em>fucking way</em> – er, there is no way I'm going to hurt Yali either. I'm really not."

"Oh…" said Alchemist. They sounded pretty disappointed. I was starting to get the idea that when Alchemist said "oh" like that, it didn't really mean they understood something. It meant they just didn't feel like pushing anymore.

"Look, it's okay. If you've got a problem with me, I want to hear about it. Just spit it out, don't leave me hanging."

Alchemist swallowed. They wobbled back and forth, trying to psych themselves up. Finally, they spoke.

"Are… you… going to hurt Morrow?"

Well, fuck.

"He's not here right now, is he?" Ugh, that was a stupid thing to say. Alchemist obviously meant in general, not right now. "I mean, I don't <em>want</em> to hurt anybody! I'm not going to hurt him if he doesn't hurt anybody else!" I said defensively.

"I… saw…" Alchemist moved the hand that wasn't holding mine, and ran their fingers wavily through the sand. Around the fingers, the sand formed into a picture – Morrow's face, with a hand print on it where I'd slapped him. "It was smaller than his hand… so it must have been you…" Alchemist said mournfully.

"Right, you would've seen that…" I said awkwardly. "So, what happened is, we tried trading phones when he was, <em>you know</em>, but then he freaked out and smashed mine. So, I was mad. But it was only for a moment! And it's not like I injured him or anything –" Ugh, I could already feel I was doing a bad job of this. If I wanted to reassure <em>Alchemist</em>, I'd have to come up with something better than saying <em>it could have been worse</em>. "I promise not to hurt him if he doesn't hurt anyone else."

"He might…" said Alchemist sadly. "He might hurt… somebody else. Will you hurt him then?"

"You're wiser than I thought," I said. Alchemist seemed not to like thinking about painful things, so I had kind of expected that they would just avoid bringing it up. But, fuck, they sure knew how to ask the hard questions. I sighed. "I, like, I can't promise it'll <em>never</em> happen, but, I guess… Even if he's hurting someone, I promise I'll try everything else I can think of first. Like, I'll, I don't know, just try to block him, or whatever. I promise."

"Thanks…" Alchemist clearly wasn't <em>completely</em> satisfied, but they sounded sincere. Tentatively, they put their arms around me. Their hug was warm and gentle, lumpy in some places and bony in others. I hugged them back. And then, abruptly, they went limp, collapsing half their weight onto my shoulders.

I quickly adjusted so I could hold them up. "Woah, are you okay there?!"

Alchemist had tears streaming down their face. "Mama, Papa, Bubele, Niemah…" they sobbed. They kept crying and saying more names, probably all the people they had left behind on Earth.

"Hey, hey, it's okay. We'll get you back to everyone safe and sound." I squeezed them tight.

"But I'm so… I'm so…"

"Sad?"

Alchemist nodded. "And…"

"Scared?"

They nodded again. "And…"

"Lonely?"

Another nod.

"Well, I'm here!" I said cheerfully. Alchemist giggled despite themself.

<bigbreak>

Traveling with Alchemist was oddly comforting.

After a while, it had finally sunk in that I was never going to find Yali anytime soon. I had felt defeated, bitter, like there was a yawning hole in me, an empty space where my mission should have been. But then Alchemist came and… <em>filled</em> some of that space. I didn't understand how, but somehow, it was easier to just focus on what I was doing with Alchemist than to worry about the gods. The gentle resonance of their voice was almost enough to distract me.

Bit by bit, they started to share more details about their life before the Ravelling. Their family life sounded really boisterous. They had five brothers and three sisters, and a bunch of aunts and uncles who lived with the family most of the year as well. Before the Ravelling, I'd always been like, "siblings, who needs 'em", but the way Alchemist described it, it sounded wonderful. They kept telling me about different little traditions and habits everyone had. Alchemist obviously loved all of their siblings deeply, it was really sweet. Of course, it was also sad. Sometimes, they just talked about everyone happily, lost in the fond memories. Other times, they barely got started before their eyes got all teary. But that made sense to me now. Having random, different feelings about the same thing, depending on which thought happened first, was kind of what I'd been living with for a while.

The weirdest thing was the world around us.

"Seriously, what's up with there not being any puzzles here?" I said one day. We had been wandering aimlessly through foggy landscapes for ages, only pausing occasionally to manifest a place to rest. It didn't seem like the rest of the Endless Maze at all.

"I think, maybe, there are? If you just, wait, and, let them come to you?"

"What the – I mean, what do you mean by that?"

"One time, I, was lying down, and I saw, a shape? On the, rocks, there was a, shadow, the light between the different rocks. It made a shape. And then I made the shape, with the stones. And then, it gave me another shape… There was a sequence…"

"Did it lead to something?"

"I forgot one of the shapes…"

"Oh."

"It's okay. Maybe it'll come back later."

I was kinda tired from walking, so I manifested one of my giant fluffy couches and flopped down in it. Alchemist joined me, and we leaned together, shoulder to shoulder.

I idly pulled out my broken phone and fidgeted with it in my hand. Twirling it around to catch the light, idly poking at the buttons as if it would turn on again.

Alchemist leaned in to take a closer look. "Is that, the one that, broke?"

"Yeah…" I muttered.

"It's, still, broken?"

"Phones don't unbreak by themselves!" I said irritably. Alchemist flinched. Oh right, they were pretty sensitive, I shouldn't be snapping at them like that.

"Maybe, if, you…?"

"If I what, manifested it back together?" I held the phone at arm's length, as if I was trying to find an angle to fix it from. "I wish. But Yali said we probably can't manifest on our phones because we don't know how they work – wait, no, she said we couldn't <em>recharge</em> them because we don't really know how to do anything but put them <em>completely</em> back to how they were before – wait, that's it!" I wished I had Yali here to tell me whether it would actually work. But it wasn't like my phone could get <em>more</em> broken. I focused my mind at the phone, willing it to change back to how it had been right before it broke. Right away, the cracks disappeared and the screen lit up.

I threw my arms around Alchemist and hugged them tight. "That's amazing! You're amazing, Alchemist!"

Alchemist smiled happily.

Now that we were this comfortable together, it felt a little weird that I was still calling them by their title. "I, uh, I heard Morrow call you Raylie earlier, is that your name?"

"It's, uh, short for Raline," said Alchemist awkwardly.

"Should I call you that? I mean, calling you Alchemist all the time just feels kinda… cold and formal," I said.

Alchemist shrugged. "You can call me whatever you like."

"Okay, uh…" They'd technically given me permission, but calling them Raline just didn't feel right. They hadn't told me that name willingly, and they didn't really seem enthusiastic about it now. For all I knew, they didn't even want <em>Morrow</em> to know that name! Morrow could have just read it out of their mind somehow, and started using it without asking. Or with asking. I got the impression that Alchemist wasn't very comfortable saying no to things. "Look, you're allowed to say no to me if you don't want me to. I won't bite."

That made Alchemist look even more uncomfortable, Stern take it.

"So, uh, you know how Morrow can read your mind all the time?"

Alchemist smiled involuntarily.

"Hang on, is he reading your mind right now?!"

"No… We're too far away, he can only smell and, touch, my feelings, from here…" they said sadly.

"So… are you, like, okay with that? With him reading your mind?"

"It's <em>wonderful</em>." Alchemist's face lit right up, and their voice turned all relaxed and dreamy. "He always knows what I want. I never have to figure it out myself when he's around. He makes me so <em>happy</em>." Alchemist giggled a little. It was so cute.

"Hang on, you normally have to figure out what you want? How do you not know what you want?"

"I, just, don't know? I, how do other people know what they want?"

"I mean, I just want things. What does it mean to want something without knowing what it is?"

"Oh…" sighed Alchemist disappointedly. They had such an expressive, emotional face. When they were happy, they looked totally blissful, and when they were sad, they looked like just the saddest thing <em>ever</em>. I just wanted to hug them forever.

"Do you want a hug?" I said.

We both moved in for a hug awkwardly, bumping our arms into each other.

Alchemist  [????? More description]

When we pulled away, 

?????

<bigbreak>

The more time I spent among the rocks here, the more they seemed… just not quite right. For one thing, rocks were supposed to have rough edges. But all the rocks here were smooth and blobby, almost… organic. And the world was almost completely repetitive, it was like we kept walking past the same rock over and over again. But it was never <em>exactly</em> the same. Seeing them <em>almost</em> settle into a pattern, then be <em>slightly</em> off the pattern, was downright eerie.

But none of that was the <em>really</em> weird thing about them. The <em>really</em> weird thing about them was…

I had no idea.

It was driving me crazy. I felt trapped in this place. Even if I wasn't going to get to Yali, it was so stupid to not even TRY to get closer to her! So I had started checking the map obsessively, measuring out from my position to the nearest landmarks, to make sure I was actually getting somewhere and the Seeking God wasn't somehow cheating me out of my progress. But it <em>was</em>! My location on the map didn't stay consistent at all, it just sort of randomly moved around, independent of the direction we were going.

Right now, I was tired, slouching on a couch I made, cuddling with Alchemist. At least <em>this</em> part was comfortable.

"This fucking map!" I complained. "We go one direction, and it says we're going the other! And not even consistently! This whole place…"

Alchemist rubbed my shoulder gently, not saying anything. It was nice and all, but it wasn't really what I cared about right now.

"Alchemist, what do you think? How do we get out of here?"

"I, don't, know?"

"Come on, work with me here. You've gotta have <em>some</em> idea."

"Well, maybe, I, wonder, if,…"

"Go on, spit it out."

"I, maybe, see you trying so hard, and nothing changing. I wonder if, maybe, that's why?"

"That's why what?"

"I saw, more things change, in the stones, before you, were here. It was easier, without, trying to make it happen. I wonder if, because you're trying so hard, that's why, it doesn't…"

"What, so I'm not supposed to <em>try –</em>?!" <em>Fuck that! Fuck this whole place!!</em> I yelled inside my head. But of course, I didn't yell it out loud, because it was fucking <em>Alchemist</em>. I just gritted my teeth in frustration.

Ugh, why did the Seeking have to stick me with Alchemist? I felt like I was having to suppress my feelings all the time. And sure, I had to suppress some of my feelings with Yali, too, but at least Yali let me <em>be</em> angry, just as long as it wasn't at <em>her</em>.

That was the problem – I liked Alchemist, but they just… <em>weren't Yali</em>. Even right now, I was comfortable enough here cuddling with Alchemist in the soft cushions I'd made, but it just wasn't the same. I missed Yali's big strong arms around me… Her lips, her wide soft cheeks…

The fucking gods. It was bad enough that the Blood God was trying to make me kill her. Now the Seeking God wouldn't even let me be <em>close</em> to her?! For gods-knew-what mysterious scheme? All I wanted to do was <em>touch</em> her. If only I had her here right now, she could ruffle my hair, squish me under her weight… I imagined her squishing me, pressing into me like she had when we wrestled on that one day before the Ravelling. That was how life should be. Why wouldn't they let us have that?

I drifted out my daydream to find that I was nuzzling up beside Alchemist's head, practically brushing my lips against their neck. I pulled back sharply. "I'm not – I didn't mean –"

Alchemist sleepily laid an arm over my shoulders and tugged me back towards them.

"I didn't mean to be so – intimate – I'm with Yali! I mean – we're poly, I guess –" Heat rose in my cheeks. Alchemist's big eyes drifted close to my face. "I mean, I don't like you in <em>that way</em> –" I gently pulled away again. Alchemist's arm stayed around me, not quite limp, reluctant but allowing me to go. But before I pulled all the way, a heavy hesitation settled over me. I couldn't bear to do it. All of a sudden, Alchemist looked so sad and lonely… "Wait –" I said. "Do <em>you</em> – how do you, uh, feel about me?"

"I don't, know?"

Uncertainly, I allowed Alchemist to pull me closer to them again. They laid their head beside mine, rubbing our cheeks together.

<em>Fuck.</em>

I <em>did</em> like Alchemist in <em>that way</em>.

My feelings were a huge mess. It wasn't supposed to be Alchemist here, it was supposed to be Yali! But the gentle pressure on my cheek told a different story. My heart wanted to sink into Alchemist, to leave the rest of my worries behind. I wasn't even sure if I liked them for themselves or if I was just trying to pretend they were Yali. And I didn't know which was worse. If I just used them as a temporary substitute for Yali, that would make me an asshole! But if I pulled away, then… I'd be… so alone…

Tears came into my eyes. I clung to Alchemist, clutching at the soft back of their robe helplessly. Alchemist held me gently, rocking back and forth and slowly rubbing my back. I couldn't help relaxing into it. I needed this. I needed someone to hold me.

Alchemist let me slowly cry on them for a while. They just kept holding me and humming their aimless tune. I just buried my face in their robe. There were at least three parts of me that were uneasy about this, but they weren't strong enough to do anything. They were practically getting washed away in the feeling of release.

I wiped my tears away on Alchemist's robe. Not that it was really help, since there would be more soon enough. "What will Morrow think?" I mumbled. "About us, uh, being like this?"

"Morrow won't mind."

I was surprised by how confident Alchemist sounded. I had pretty much been expecting that they would just say <em>I don't know</em> again. "Are you really sure about that?"

"I can feel, what, Morrow wants? He likes it when I'm, happy. Like this." Alchemist smiled involuntarily.

"Woah, so, you're actually happy?"

"I, I guess I am?" said Alchemist happily.

"Well, uh –" I said uncomfortably. I really didn't want to lead Alchemist into expecting something that wasn't going to happen. "So, you know, right, just so you know, when I'm back with Yali, I don't know if I'll want to keep, you know…"

"I know," said Alchemist.

<bigbreak>

Being intimate with Alchemist was like having one injury healed and another injury ripped back open. We spent hours lying together, nestled in each other's arms, rubbing our faces together and exchanging soft kisses from time to time. It filled me up with such warmth, such wholesomeness, I felt like I could just float in that feeling forever. But at the same time, the more we touched, the more I couldn't stop thinking about Yali, too. With Alchemist, I had such a deep, emotional closeness, but… I just wasn't that attracted to them physically. Even when we touched, my skin was craving something else. Something big and squishy and strong and luscious and <em>Yali</em>. ????

Well, at least I was having the <em>good</em> obsession with Yali instead of the <em>bad</em> obsession with Yali. Any time I fantasized about getting in her pants instead of killing her to death, that was a win in my book.

How many days had it been now? Somehow, the time just melted away when I was with Alchemist. And even when the Blood God popped up, its fury was also doubtful, mixed with something bittersweet. Nothing was <em>quite</em> how it should be, but still, somehow, every part of me had agreed to let this happen. Just for a while, to forget the mission, forget the puzzles, and just lean into the warmth.

And that's when I first began to notice… <em>it</em>.

We were lying in one of the many beds we'd left littered across the sand. As I stuck my head out to adjust the blankets, I thought I saw a peephole through the rock. When I looked, there wasn't actually a hole in any individual rock. It was just, when my eye was in <em>exactly</em> the right place, a bunch of totally separate rocks combined to look like a narrow hole. But when I looked down the "hole", I could see a long way, going straight past the fog.

I jumped up. "It's like it's showing me something!" Before Alchemist could say anything, I took off running in the direction it had pointed.

Unfortunately, before long, I lost my sense of direction. I wasn't sure I was still going along the same line I had seen. I tried to line up my eye with the rocks I'seen before, but I couldn't find the spot.

"Argh! I lost it! I've got to find it again –"

Alchemist padded up behind me. "I don't think, trying to force it, will –"

"Come on! This could be our chance to GET somewhere!!" I kept frantically searching for the line of sight.

But of course, it didn't work. Alchemist was right. Pissed off and dejected, I wandered back and let Alchemist fold me into their arms.

"I thought I <em>had</em> something," I muttered irritably.

Alchemist just pulled me gently closer. Not knowing what else to do, I leaned into them and brushed my lips against theirs. But I still just felt stupid. Why was I wasting my time kissing someone irrelevant like Alchemist when I had more important things to do?!

A few hours later, just when I had almost forgotten about it, I randomly saw the peephole again. Or maybe a different peephole, I couldn't really tell. This time, I wasn't going to mess it up. I slowly worked my way in the direction it was pointing, methodically lining up my eye with each rock in the sequence to make sure I still had it. Alchemist followed along, sometimes pausing to look down the peephole for a while.

It went on for a long time. I didn't see anything new, though. Finally, I got tired and sat down with Alchemist again.

"It's <em>teasing</em> me," I complained. "Making me think I have a choice. But it's just going to keep doing this to me forever."

"It's, okay –"

"No it's not," I snapped. I didn't want to be snapping at Alchemist, but it came out before I could think. Dejectedly, I looked again in the direction we were going. I wasn't expecting her to be anything there. There was just more fog. Except… "Wait. Is that –" I jumped up and ran a few steps forward, peering into the fog.

Sure enough, there was something there. Not far in front of us, the ground ended. A cliff dropped away downwards. "Hey! Check this out!" I yelled.

"Rinn –" began Alchemist sadly.

"Come on, I really found something this time!"

"Hey! Check this out!" my voice came echoing back to me. So this wasn't just a cliff, it was an enormous gorge.

I stepped right up to the edge. Alchemist followed a few steps back. The wall of the gorge went down further than I could see through the fog, and there was a strong breeze blowing up from the depths. Along the wall, there were long ramps zigzagging back and forth, offering paths to walk downwards.

"Maybe it wasn't a trick after all! Let's see what's down there!" I headed for one of the ramps.

Alchemist's hand tugged me back.

"What are we waiting for?! This is the first new thing we've seen in days! This could be our way out of this desert!!"

"When you're, looking for a way out, it doesn't make you feel good…"

"I'm not TRYING to feel good, I'm trying to get OUT of here!!" I yanked my hand away from Alchemist. "You can stay back here and keep wasting your time if you want to! I'm going to DO something!"

Alchemist's mouth opened and closed a little. They stared back at me, distraught.

In my frustration, I didn't <em>want</em> to care how Alchemist felt, but it still hit me like a stab in the gut. "I, uh, I didn't mean that," I said through gritted teeth. "Look, I'm going to, uh, <em>go</em>. Like, for a walk."

It hurt me to leave Alchemist on that sour note, but with all the thundering impatience in my head, I couldn't get myself to say anything nicer either. I stood up and stomped off before I could make things worse.

Not sure where to go, I picked out one of the ramps into the gorge. At least that way there'd be more new stuff to distract me. As I walked through the cold, damp air, it took me zigzagging back and forth, down and down into the gorge, until the fog was too thick to see my way back up.

As I walked, I thought about ?????. Alchemist was right, it wasn't making me feel good. And what was I even getting out of it? The Seeking God was going to mess with me either way. Worse, every time I played along with its tricks, I was basically handing it more power over me.

????? [Unless I could beat the Seeking God/there was no way I could beat a god that could transport me through space whenever I wanted. What was a "me" thing that I could do now?]

I wanted Alchemist to be happy.

But thinking about that made the rage flare up inside me. <em>This is no time to just sit around doing nice things for Alchemist!</em>

"What the fuck <em>is</em> it time to do, then?!" I yelled.

<em>I have to do SOMETHING! This isn't right! This isn't enough!</em> I was getting sick of these thoughts. If only I didn't have the Blood God looking over my shoulder all the time.

"You are <em>not me</em>," I shouted into the void. "I don't care what you want! I don't care about your fucking murder quest! And I'm sick of you trying to take away my chance to enjoy being with Alchemist when there's nothing we can even do anyway! And so, I am going to go back up there, and be everything Alchemist wants me to be! I will treat them like an absolute princess! I mean, a… whatever the non-binary equivalent of princess is! A princ… uh… whatever, actually even if they were a dude I'd still say I was going to treat them like a princess! So that's what I'm going to do! You hear me?!"

The wind howled through the gorge in front of me. From the part of me that was the Blood God, I felt… Pain. Despair. Empathy. Anger tearing in more than one direction. It was hard to tell what it was really feeling. But with the way it was fighting with itself, it definitely wasn't united against me. <em>I</em> was the strong part. <em>I</em> was the one who knew what I wanted.

[????? Maybe another, conclusive, statement directed at the Blood God?]

[????? Satisfiedly climbing back up the canyon]

When I got up to the edge, I walked over to Alchemist. "Hey," I said softly. I gave them a gentle hug. "I got some things figured out about myself. I'm sorry about earlier. Let's do things your way."

<bigbreak>

?????

[????? making progress by not trying; resentment because this was technically a lesson, but the Seeking God had no right to force lessons on me at a time like this]

[????? Alchemist took a walk and then didn't come back and then I went and found them crying]

"If you need some space away from me, I can –"

"It's not, that…"

"Okay, then, what is it? Come on, talk to me."

"This doesn't… feel right." Alchemist went quiet for a while. I stayed quiet to let them continue. "I can tell, you, have been trying, so hard, to, care for me. And Morrow, told me, how, you, maybe, fought so hard, to, keep him safe, when he was, hurting himself. Having you work so hard, for us… it just, doesn't feel right."

"But… I care about you! Why shouldn't I work hard for you?!" I couldn't stop a note of desperation from creeping into my voice. I had poured myself into Alchemist in these last days, and now it felt like they were tugging it away from me.

"But you're so young. Me and Morrow…"

"Don't turn all Stern on me! I can make my own decisions!" I snapped. "How the fuck old are you, anyway?"

"I'm twenty…" I had already assumed Alchemist was older than me, so that wasn't too surprising. "Morrow's twenty-five."

I stared, open-mouthed. "You kidding me?! No way! He doesn't <em>look</em> twenty-five. He doesn't <em>act</em> twenty-five. And how the fuck did you even get him to tell you how old he was? <em>I</em> couldn't get him to!"

"I, didn't? He, didn't, tell me. It was… little things. There were some shows he referred to, and, things from the news, that he might not know, if he was just my age. He was… so… upset, when I realized. He made me promise not to tell anyone…" Alchemist cringed. "Oh… I forgot…"

"Don't worry, he won't hear about it from me." Alchemist stared at me. "Wait, shit." Morrow was going to read Alchemist's mind, and then he'd find out that Alchemist had told me. And then he'd <em>also</em> find out that I'd tried to cover it up! "I mean, just don't think about it when he's around!"

"Oh…"

<em>Yeah, great job, Rinn. Great advice.</em>



?????

"You know… this has been nice. And at least the god is showing us more interesting stuff now, even if it's not really giving us a way out of this –"

The sand disappeared under me.

<bigbreak>

With a surge of adrenaline, I braced myself in the air and landed on my feet. Beside me, Alchemist wasn't so lucky.

We were in some sort of big unfinished construction area. Concrete floor, piles of bricks everywhere, surrounded by a square of half-finished brick walls. And above the walls, there was just white emptiness, as if someone had started painting this room on a canvas but then got bored halfway through. But one of the walls was different. Instead of bricks like the others, it was a wall of shimmering black, just like the portal from the last layer. I didn't see five separate portals, so maybe there was just a big one for all of us?

"Wait, is that the portal?" I said. "Are we done? That was anticlimactic."

I helped Alchemist up, then kept looking around. Over in the other corner, there were another three people. There was Morrow and Justicar, who were currently handcuffed together and fighting with each other as they tried to stand up. And – there she was!

Two tides of feeling surged within me. Finally, <em>finally</em>, after so many days, she was here again! Inside me, there was a struggle for control, between the part that wanted to run and hug her and the part that wanted to charge and rip her to pieces. But I knew which part was me and which wasn't. I bore down on the second part with all my will, and it wavered. Grinning triumphantly, I stomped it down. <em>Stay in your corner, Blood God,</em> I thought loudly. <em>I am going to love Yali, and cherish her, and give her all the care and respect she deserves, no matter what you make me feel. And if you think you can make me lift a finger to hurt her, you're stupider than I thought.</em>

I felt the rage inside me subside. It was like the Blood God had given up and decided to sulk instead. <em>Yeah, that's what I thought.</em>

Confidently, I strode across the room, walked up to Yali, and clasped her in a firm embrace.

Yali hugged me back. But after a moment, she stopped and looked at me seriously. "You've gotten the Blood God's attention."

I smirked. "Haha, guess it finally got the idea I won't let it push me around!"

"I know it feels that way, but this isn't just something to be happy about. It could be a great danger. I had hoped that we could get through the whole Ravelling without the Blood God being aware of how actively you were resisting it. But now… I can feel it. Things are shifting. I think it's going to try something, when we enter the next layer. And the other gods are starting to notice a change, too."

I gaped at her. "I thought I was doing a good job!! Does <em>everything</em> I do actually suck?!"

"I'm not, I'm not, not saying you did anything wrong –"

Meanwhile, Alchemist and Morrow were having a moment, too. Once someone had unmanifested the handcuffs, they had run up to each other and started making out. But then Alchemist started to look a little worried, and Morrow started panicking. "It's okay it's okay!!" said Morrow frantically. "It's no big deal if everyone knows –" Morrow jumped and waved for everybody's attention "– if everyone knows I'm twenty-five, that's right, I'm twenty-five years old, everybody! See, it's no big deal!"

Justicar raised an eyebrow slightly. "What prompted <em>this</em> outburst?"

"Don't worry about it," I said.

"I doubt that we should believe he is twenty-five," Justicar told me. "Come to think of it, we are an unusual combination of ages for Ravellers, are we not?"

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"She's right," said Yali. "It's not that rare to have a twenty-five-year-old Imminent, but it's a little unusual that we're <em>all</em> young adults –"

I squinted. "You'd call Justicar a <em>young</em> adult?"

"I see you have not learned <em>tact</em> since our last meeting," said Justicar.

"Whatever. How old are you, anyway?"

"If you must know, I am twenty-eight."

Yali continued, "A lot of Imminents are children, like, preteens. Alchemists can be any age. And I'm the rarest one. Most Farseers are at least middle-aged, if not elderly. There have been a few children, but never a teenager –"

"There was a fifteen-year-old Farseer in [????? year]," Justicar interrupted.

"Never in the last seventy years, at least."

"I suppose that's true –"

"What about me?" I said.

Yali answered, "Blood Children are usually teenagers. Sometimes younger, as the name implies, but –"

"I hate being the normal one!"

"It's okay. Justicar is normal, too."

Justicar and I glared at each other.

Suddenly, there was a crash of falling bricks. Morrow had knocked a hole in one of the walls, and now he was sticking his arm through into the white space beyond. Justicar rushed over to stop him.

I just watched her go. This was just some regular Morrow stuff, I didn't have to pay attention to it. Plus, the place I really wanted to be was with Yali.

I grabbed onto Yali and kissed her sloppily. Then I kissed her again. "Oh gods, Yali, I've missed you so much."

Yali smiled. "It's nice to see you alive."

"Oh gods, was I gonna die?!"

"No, no… it's just, the Seeking God, since the beginning of this layer, it's been showing me these, these, moral dilemmas. And a lot of them have been like, 'if Rinn was dying, would you cut off your right arm to save her?'. And it didn't, like, ask that in words, it showed me a vision and had me act out what I would do. So it's just –"

"What did you do?"

"In that one? I mean, I cut my arm off –"

I looked up into her eyes. "You'd actually cut your arm off to save me?! Oh my gods oh my gods oh my gods –"

"That was one of the easier choices, actually, I mean, when you think about it, my life wouldn't be <em>that</em> much different without my arm, it would just take a while to get used to –"

"You're crazy!" I hugged her tight.

"There were a lot of ones that were harder. But I learned a lot about myself, about what I would and wouldn't do. And it turned out that there's almost nothing I wouldn't do to keep us both alive. But the really hard questions were things related to… to… oh, never mind. The Seeking God just made me think about this for weeks, I'm allowed to stop thinking about it for now." She kissed me back.

"Yeah, fuck the Seeking," I said halfheartedly. Yali was here now, I couldn't be mad. I buried myself in her big, warm, squishy body. She was my everything, my one love – well, maybe not <em>one</em> love now – ugh, yeah, even right now, my feelings for Alchemist were running strong when I thought about them.

"So, uh… me and Alchemist…" I began. "We kinda –"

"I know."

"You do?"

"Future, remember?" She smirked a little. She looked around to make sure the others weren't paying attention, then muttered, "I even did a future where I asked you two to make out with each other in front of me. It was, was, kinda hot."

"WHAAAAAAAAT???" Oh gods, I had forgotten how hardcore Yali was. Suddenly it came rushing back – all my feelings of how much she blew me away. I had, like, NOTHING to worry about as far as forgetting her for Alchemist, haha.

Something felt unsteady under my feet. I shifted and looked around. Something was off, and in a moment, I realized what it was. The whole room was slowly tilting. It was going to dump us into the portal!

"What?" I yelled at by god. "You're done with us, so now you're just going to dump us out? Or –" I hung onto Yali nervously "– is that really the portal? It's just so anticlimactic, I'm thinking maybe it's a trick by the god, or something –"

Yali took a good look at it. "No, that's definitely the portal. We all have to go into it."

"It's just, it doesn't feel like we finished anything!"

"It wouldn't. The Seeking God isn't really about, about… <em>conclusions</em>."

"Fuck! I can't believe it only just let me see you and now we're getting dumped out again! And we're going to be in the Stern God's world next, too, this is gonna suck!" The floor was definitely tilting more and more. "Hey, Alchemist! Get over here! And the rest of you too –"

We all gathered in a little cluster. I tried to pull everyone into a group hug, which almost worked. "Okay, everyone," I growled, "the Seeking God is about to dump us unceremoniously into that portal. But <em>we're</em> gonna do it our <em>own</em> way. Let's all line up and step through the portal together!" I grabbed Yali's hand in one hand, and Alchemist's hand in the other. Morrow caught on right away and attached himself to Alchemist, leaving only Justicar standing by herself.

"You can go on the end with Morrow," I said, just as Justicar stepped towards the end with Yali. But she stopped and did what I said, reluctantly taking Morrow's hand. Morrow tried to prank her by yanking his hand away, but she was too quick for him, and she caught his hand in a viselike grip.

"Alright, let's –" I began.

Yali squeezed my hand hard. "<em>Remember,</em>" she whispered, "the Blood God is going to try something. Don't let it succeed. I'm trusting you."

Oblivious to Yali, Morrow shouted, "Yeeeaaahh, let's do this thing!!" He rushed forward into the portal, dragging the rest of us with him. As Alchemist's hand dragged me forward, I frantically looked back at Yali, and the last thing I saw was her eyes looking intently back at me as my body slipped into the well of magic.
