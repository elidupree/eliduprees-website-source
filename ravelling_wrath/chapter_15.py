The Broken God was a god of pleasure and pain, life and death.

According to legend, in the beginning, there were five gods â€“ the Stern God, the Blood God, the Seeking God, the Waiting God, and the <em>Great God</em>.

First, the Great God made earth and sky, sea and stone. It shaped the arch of the heavens, set the golden sun up above, and laid down generous swaths of sand and clay below.

Then it rested, and left to the other gods to play among its creations. The Stern God divided land from sea, mountain from valley. The Waiting God created the cycles of the tides, the rain, and the lumbering movements of the earth below. The Seeking God whipped up storms to tear at the land and wash it away to wherever it would go. The Blood God carved great ravines to make its mark upon the world. 

But the Great God was not done. It rose from its rest to create <em>life</em>. Trees drilled their roots into the soil, holding fast against the storm. [????? more details of more life]

The other gods loved these new beings. The Waiting God taught spiders to build great webs and beavers to block up the rivers for their own advantage. The Seeking God entered dolphins and cats, making them play for the sake of playing, and it made the forests burn one year and thrive the next. The Stern God set out how the animals would mark their territory against each other. And the Blood God reveled in their ?????.

But the Great God was not done. It rose from his rest to create <em>humankind</em>.

The other gods recoiled as their forests were cut down, their beloved animals slaughtered for humanity's comfort. But they soon forgot their worries, for within humanity there was a potential greater than everything that came before. The gods set about creating cultures and traditions, laws and morals. The Stern God made them build walls and temples, perform worship and sacrifice. The Waiting God showed them how to remember their ancestors and dream for the generations yet to come. The Seeking God gave them the ingenuity to create things that even the gods had not dreamed of. And the Blood God filled them all with a passion for life, bringing meaning to their brief and chaotic existences.

But the Great God was not done. It began to dream of its next creation, which would overturn even humanity.

But this time, the other gods were not content. They had poured their souls into humanity, and they refused to see their accomplishments torn apart because of the Great God's whim. So together, they fought back. The Seeking God found the Great God's secret weakness. The Waiting God orchestrated the plan to strike before it would eat aware of the danger. The Stern and Blood became the sword and flame that would seal the Great God's downfall.

Together, they <em>broke</em> the Great God.

The Blood God tore out the core of its soul, the rope of fibers that kept its will coherent against the chaos of arbitrary thought. The Stern God sliced apart the woven fabric of its design for the universe. The Seeking God ripped off the glowing tendrils that gave it the spark of intention. And the Waiting God traced the remaining threads to every knotted clump of desire, and scattered them, so that it could never again act to achieve any chosen outcome.

Purposeless, intentionless, the Broken God drifted in the world.

But though it was broken, it was still the god of ?????,. Where its drifting threads touched the world, new life sprang forth, and what was already living died meaningless deaths in equal measure. The fragments of its will continued, simply with no central purpose to guide them. [???? It did one thing and also another.] It filled some humans with feelings that overwhelmed thought, and emptied others. ?????

So, even today, the four gods wage a constant struggle, to maintain their vision for humanity against the tidal wave of the Broken.

Nowadays, we know that the legend isn't entirely true. After all, there are other cities with other gods. ?????



[????? Not sure if this chapter or the next two: Justicar avoided having the confrontation in this world because the Broken God complicates her desired confrontation; Yali also finds this world uncomfortable, while Rinn enjoys it]
