The Broken God was a god of pleasure and pain, life and death.

According to legend, in the beginning, there were five gods – the Stern God, the Blood God, the Seeking God, the Waiting God, and the <em>Great God</em>.

First, the Great God made earth and sky, sea and stone. It shaped the arch of the heavens, set the golden sun up above, and laid down generous swaths of sand and clay below.

Then it rested, and left to the other gods to play among its creations. The Stern God divided land from sea, mountain from valley. The Waiting God created the cycles of the tides, the rain, and the lumbering movements of the earth below. The Seeking God whipped up storms to tear at the land and wash it away to wherever it would go. The Blood God carved great ravines to make its mark upon the world. 

But the Great God was not done. It rose from its rest to create <em>life</em>. Trees drilled their roots into the soil, holding fast against the storm. [????? more details of more life]

The other gods loved these new beings. The Waiting God taught spiders to build great webs and beavers to block up the rivers for their own advantage. The Seeking God entered dolphins and cats, making them play for the sake of playing, and it made the forests burn one year and thrive the next. The Stern God set out how the animals would mark their territory against each other. And the Blood God reveled in their ?????.

But the Great God was not done. It rose from his rest to create <em>humankind</em>.

The other gods recoiled as their forests were cut down, their beloved animals slaughtered for humanity's comfort. But they soon forgot their worries, for within humanity there was a potential greater than everything that came before. The gods set about creating cultures and traditions, laws and morals. The Stern God made them build walls and temples, perform worship and sacrifice. The Waiting God showed them how to remember their ancestors and dream for the generations yet to come. The Seeking God gave them the ingenuity to create things that even the gods had not dreamed of. And the Blood God filled them all with a passion for life, bringing meaning to their brief and chaotic existences.

But the Great God was not done. It began to dream of its next creation, which would overturn even humanity.

But this time, the other gods were not content. They had poured their souls into humanity, and they refused to see their accomplishments torn apart because of the Great God's whim. So together, they fought back. The Seeking God found the Great God's secret weakness. The Waiting God orchestrated the plan to strike before it would eat aware of the danger. The Stern and Blood became the sword and flame that would seal the Great God's downfall.

Together, they <em>broke</em> the Great God.

The Blood God tore out the core of its soul, the rope of fibers that kept its will coherent against the chaos of arbitrary thought. The Stern God sliced apart the woven fabric of its design for the universe. The Seeking God ripped off the glowing tendrils that gave it the spark of intention. And the Waiting God traced the remaining threads to every knotted clump of desire, and scattered them, so that it could never again act to achieve any chosen outcome.

Purposeless, intentionless, the Broken God drifted in the world.

But though it was broken, it was still the god of ?????,. Where its drifting threads touched the world, new life sprang forth, and what was already living died meaningless deaths in equal measure. The fragments of its will continued, simply with no central purpose to guide them. [???? It did one thing and also another.] It filled some humans with feelings that overwhelmed thought, and emptied others. ?????

So, even today, the four gods wage a constant struggle, to maintain their vision for humanity against the tidal wave of the Broken.

Nowadays, we know that the legend isn't entirely true. After all, there are other cities with other gods. ?????

The first thing I heard was the rustle of leaves in the wind. The first thing I smelled was the soft odor of the rotten treetrunk nearby. I looked around, and saw grass and trees, mushrooms and mold. <em>Life</em>.

In all of the Otherworld so far, there hadn't been a single living thing besides us Ravellers. I hadn't thought about it too much at the time, but now that I was here, I couldn't wait to take it all in. I shamelessly hugged one of the trees, scraping my face on the hard bark and laughing.

The next thing I did was I got rid of the uniform the Stern God made me wear. I stepped out into the open and manifested blades from every pore of my skin, shredding the stiff cloth into a zillion little scraps. I shook them off into a little pile, and peeled away the last few bits that had stuck to my sweat. Then, standing naked in the wilderness, I manifested a ball of fire in my hand and threw it on the pile, burning the hateful uniform into ash. And good riddance.

Then I threw myself into the grass.

My skin drank up the cool morning dew like a ?????. Every part of me was [????? happy], from the tall grasses tickling my neck all the way down to my toes digging into the soft earth. I rolled over and over, reveling in my freedom to throw all worries to the wind and relax.

Haha, Yali could see me right now, couldn't she. This wasn't <em>quite</em> how I'd been expecting for Yali to see me naked for the first time. I smirked. If she didn't like it, she'd just have to deal with it. I stretched out luxuriantly, ?????

?????

[????? After I was done lying around], I got up and started walking. It didn't really matter which <em>way</em> I walked – I had no idea where anyone was anyway, and Yali could see exactly where <em>I</em> was, so she was going to come find me regardless. But something had just made me feel like exploring.

?????

Yali began to cry.

I had always assumed that if I ever saw Yali cry, it would be dignified, like in a movie where someone sheds a single tear while staring mournfully into the distance. But it wasn't like that at all. Her face sort of scrunched up ????? [????? If Yali was crying, that meant something really bad , I was scared because , what could it even be?]

Not thinking of anything else to do, I turned to Alchemist. "Alchemist, what happened? Is she –"

Alchemist's face looked like [????? nothing I'd seen before]. They ?????. I could see fear and anger wrestling inside them.

?????, anger won.

"<em>What happened</em>," Alchemist exploded, "is that <em>your girlfriend</em> beat Morrow half to death!"

<bigbreak>

" Yali thundered, yelling in Alchemist's face.

"Hey, go easy on them!" I said.


[????? Alchemist and Yali argue about what to do with Morrow]

"We have to do <em>something</em>," I interrupted. "Otherwise, Justicar is going to kill him."

"Well maybe he SHOULD be killed!" Yali snapped back.

"No fucking way! Look, if you'd killed him when he was, uh, assaulting me, I guess, I'd understand that. But there is no FUCKING way I'm going to let JUSTICAR be the one to kill him. I'd rather –" I was about to say <em>I'd rather kill him myself</em>, but I didn't really want to say that in front of Alchemist.

?????

"He… he… never went to school? No, they sent him to school once, but the, the teachers yelled at him, called him a freak, sent him home, because, because, he, touched other children sexually. But…" [????? Yali voice/feelings] "that's a textbook sign of sexual abuse! Every Stern teacher is supposed to be trained to recognize the signs of abuse, they're supposed to –"

"You think the Stern give a shit about us?" I said hotly.

Yali looked dismayed. "I, I know people don't always do what they're supposed to, but, they, they just didn't care! At all! They saw how he was acting, they even saw his bruises! And they just sent him right back home to be beaten again! How could they just <em>not care?</em>"

"Yeah, well, maybe they care about you if you're a <em>Seti</em>."

The words hung in the air between us.

[????? Not sure if this chapter or the next two: Justicar avoided having the confrontation in this world because the Broken God complicates her desired confrontation; Yali also finds this world uncomfortable, while Rinn enjoys it]


[????? when revealing Morrow's backstory: remember to emphasize his inherent curiousity]
