[????? early in this chapter: Justicar predicts that they will not find Yali, reasoning about Yali being too willing to give answers]

"I do not expect that we will," said Justicar.

"You kidding me? Let me guess, it's because I'd like that, and nothing I like is allowed to happen."

"The law of the Seeking is to challenge us with riddles. What do you think would happen if your Farseer were here? Although she –"

"She's not 'my Farseer', she's my girlfriend!"

"– Although she is wise for her years, she is still young. She has not fully realized that the virtue of restraint – to ?????, not to use the Waiting God's knowledge for every idle pursuit. So if she were with us –"

"You're saying she'd give us the answers too easily."

"Yes. It would contradict the will of the Seeking, so the Seeking will not allow it. If it has shown her location to us, it must have a different reason. We <em>may</em> reach her in a physical sense, but even if we do, it will be another layer of the Seeking God's game, not the happy reunion you are imagining."

"Well fuck you too. <em>I</em> say after I do these puzzles, the Seeking will reward me by letting me get – letting me see my fucking girlfriend. Rewards are part of a puzzle too, you know!"

"You can believe what you like."

[????? Somewhere in this chapter: noticing that the type of puzzles is dependent on who is running into them]

[????? Somewhere in this chapter: Justicar saying that her understanding of "the laws by which each god/world functions" gives her an advantage]

[????? somewhere in this chapter: Justicar's parents and the big decision]


Up ahead of us was a big room where the floor was divided into a square grid, with each square about a meter wide. A lot of the squares had glass walls rising up from them, forming smaller rooms and hallways within the big gid. Other squares were missing, leaving pits going down into the floor. Still other squares had doors, buttons, levers, and other devices I didn't recognize.

?????

"The walls are made of glass so that we can see the whole puzzle at once."

?????

"Holy shit, that was badass!" I said.

"Please move," said Justicar tightly, the flames still rolling off of her.

"Uh, right," I said shakily. I moved back. Justicar stepped out of the flames. She concentrated, and the remaining smoke blew away from her armor, leaving it shining as bright as new.

"So is that armor, like, fireproof? Or, wait, did you just manifest the fire away from you? But the god doesn't let us manifest on parts of the puzzle –" Even just standing <em>near</em> the flames felt really hot, and trying to manifest my skin to be cooler didn't help at all.

"The Stern God's will protects me from all forms of physical harm. This armor is only a physical representation of that will." She looked at the puzzle ahead of us. "It appears that there are more corridors blocked off by the flames. So that is the first rule of this puzzle: Only the Justicar can stand safely in the flames. For us both to get past those corridors, I will have to block the flames while you run past."

"Yeah, okay," I said.

"The question is, how will we get past the dead end directly in front of us?"

Sure enough,

?????

[Probably down time where Rinn starts engaging Justicar about Justicar's beliefs]

[Maybe Justicar believes that Rinn is going down the wrong path because Rinn's parents haven't been good Stern role models, so Justicar should try to be that]

"I was not so different from you once. I [????? thought the world belonged to me? Multiple examples]."


?????

"parties with underage drinking"

"Sure, I've been to some of those. Only we didn't call them 'parties with underage drinking', we called them 'parties'." I manifested a glass of beer and whooped. I was mostly just messing with her, though. [????? Oops, this has to be past tense narration?: "The truth is, I hardly ever drink alcohol. Look at me – I'm tiny. I go from zero to wasted in, like, ONE beer."] The first time I had ever gotten drunk, I had tried to kiss an older girl – and <em>missed</em>, and smashed my face into the table next to her. At least, that's what I heard from the other girls who had to take care of me and drive me home, while I kept hitting on them even though I couldn't sit up straight and had a huge bruise on my face. So a couple weeks later I went back to the next party with the same crowd, and that time I stayed completely sober while I went up to the same girl and started making out with her in front of everyone. And then she had taken me up to her room, and… haha, good times.
?????

"I had sex with many different men."

"Haha, that's where you went wrong. Shoulda had sex with girls instead."

Justicar looked a little frustrated.

"You got a problem with that? With me liking girls?"

Justicar sighed. "I won't rise to your provocation."

"So you <em>do</em> have a problem with it!" I said triumphantly.

"I am not homophobic!" said Justicar angrily. She struggled to find the right words. "It didn't matter <em>who</em> I was having sex with! I –"

"Also, you say you 'had sex' with these men when you were [????? very drunk]. Isn't that… rape?"

"I put myself in that situation willingly."

"What, like you got [????? very drunk] specifically to have sex with some dude?"

"No, but it doesn't matter if –"

"Then I don't see how it was consensual," I ?????.

Justicar glared at me. "Are you so eager to avoid taking responsibility for your actions that you must see victimhood everywhere, even when I tell you myself that I was not a victim?"

"What the fuck! Of course I take responsibility for my actions! When I hurt someone else, that's my responsibility. When someone else hurts me, that's their responsibility. It's not that complicated!"

"So, according to you, any time you have sex with a drunk person, that's rape?"

"Uh, generally," I said. I felt like she was trying to pin me down with some sort of clever logic. And I wasn't sure all of the girls <em>I'd</em> been with had been totally sober at the time, so that was a little uncomfortable.

"Then you could just as well say that <em>I</em> raped some of those <em>men</em>."

"Haha, maybe you did! Did you check in with them afterwards or anything? It's not like they'd come up to you the next day and be like, 'By the way, Justicar,' or whatever your real name is, 'you actually traumatized me last night, just so you know'!"

Justicar was smiling – the smile of someone who's being patient with a little kid who's talking nonsense. Stern take it, if I wanted to get through to her, I couldn't just keep saying the first thing that came into my head, even if it wasn't wrong. "So, what, do you think drunk girls are just asking for it?!" I snapped.

"If you would give me a chance to explain the actual principles I follow, you would know I do not believe anything like that. It is always wrong to force yourself on someone else. But no one forced themselves on me. It was my own choice to devalue my body like that. I <em>chose</em> to fill my nights with sexual indiscretions, to distract myself from how I was squandering the true worth of my life. I had no self-respect."

Up to this point, I had mostly just been messing with her. But [????? this was serious. I got all charged up.] "That's your <em>real</em> problem," I said coldly. "But –" I made a fist in front of my heart "– <em>I've</em> got <em>loads</em> of self-respect. If anyone doesn't treat me right, they can fuck right off. ?????"

"When I was your age, I too believed that I was being assertive and empowered."

"Yeah, so, maybe I'm in denial. Or maybe you're just wrong. You ever think about that??"

"You can believe what you like," she said.

?????

"?????? Of course I'm never going to do ?????! That shit fucks you up! I mean, not that you're fucked up because you did ?????. <em>You're</em> fucked up for completely unrelated reasons," I said, jabbing my finger into the chest plate of her armor. "Ow, that hurts."

"Please stop being drunk," said Justicar wearily.

?????

"So," I said, summing things up, "what I'm hearing is, first, your life sucked. And then you found the Stern. And now, your life still sucks. When was the last time you enjoyed yourself?"

"It is not important whether I enjoy myself. What is important is whether I stay true to my principles."






?????

[????? Rinn assumes that Justicar would approve of anything done in the name of the Stern, and Justicar reveals that she was a police officer]

"You assume, simply because a thing was done in the name of the Stern, that I would approve of it. But not all who claim to follow the Stern truly uphold its principles. Even the highest ranks of the Stern Temple are full of – have their share of hypocrites


?????


"So, when you were a cop, how many people did you put in prison?"

"Police officers do not 'put people in prison'. It is judges and juries who determine sentencing."

I was about to complain ????? when another, much more serious thought shot through me. "<em>Now</em> who's not taking responsibility for their actions?!" I demanded.

"We each do our own part in the system, and only our own part. If a conviction is unjust, that cannot be laid at the feet of officers who were only carrying out their duties."

"Are you kidding me!! If I throw someone in a pit full of vipers, do you think I get to say, 'oh, it's not my fault, I'M not the one who put those vipers in that pit'!?! Or do you want to lay the blame where it fucking belongs?"

????? [????? The person who went to prison for shoplifting]

"Very well." Justicar opened her arms. "If you want to hold me individually responsible for every violent act ever performed in the name of the Stern, perhaps <em>I</em> should hold <em>you</em> responsible for the damage caused by <em>your</em> ideology."

"And what's that?"

"The collapse of society. Mass starvation. Gangs slaughtering each other in the streets."

"Oh yeah? When did that happen?"

"The only reason it has not happened is the fact that <em>the Stern are still in control</em>. What would happen if we put a child like yourself in charge of society? You claim to value people's lives above order [????? set that up], but that is a contradiction, because order is the way that people's lives are preserved. If the laws against shoplifting cannot be enforced, then shoplifting will run rampant. If people can steal things as easily as buy them, how will stores make money? If stores cannot make money, who will be incentivized to import goods into the city? Food?"

"I mean, if I'm in charge, I can just tell someone to import food into the city."

"Because you have seen how a tower is shaped, you imagine that you could tear one down and build another from the ruins without any tools.

?????

"The lower gods act without thinking. The upper gods tarry in thought without taking meaningful action. Only the Stern, which stands in the middle, has the [????? balance necessary to run a society]. That is why the Stern Temple officially controls three fifths of the city, and why the Stern God ?????, despite what it lacks in raw power."

"Lacks in raw power? I thought all the gods were equally powerful."

"No. For one, the Broken God's power vastly exceeds that of all the others. Among the others, the Waiting God has the most, but rarely uses it. Then comes the Blood God – or <em>would</em> come, had it not [????? been deprived of rejuvenation; but phrase it in a way that sounds approving]. The Stern God is second to last, and last is the Seeking, which spends its power frivolously." Justicar waved an arm, indicating the elaborate puzzles all around us.

"How come you and Yali get to know all kinds of stuff about the gods? The Blood God never told <em>me</em> anything cool."

"This knowledge does not come from the Stern God directly. I simply paid attention in divinity class, [????? after I changed]."

"Fuck you."

?????

[????? The final puzzle where Justicar has to admit the first rule was wrong]

"What I <em>really</em> don't get is this extra flamethrower over here on my side," I said. "It doesn't <em>do</em> anything. It's literally just down a dead end, not blocking off anything!"

"In that case, it is irrelevant to the puzzle. It may be intended as a distraction."

"It's out of place, though. There haven't been distractions like this before…"

?????

"I can't believe I went this whole way [????? acting like I was against the rules, but the very first time you stated a rule, I believed it]"

?????


"Where are you going?" said Justicar.

"The tunnel's bending back! We're getting farther away from Yali this way!"

"You see? I told you the Seeking God would never allow us to reach the Farseer this way."

I kept looking at the map in my hand. Going too far in one direction took me further away from her. Going too far in the other direction also took me further away from her. I found the closest point, and glared at the wall there. On the map, the little Burning Heart and the little Watchful Eye were so close they were almost touching.

"She's right on the other side of this wall!!" I yelled. "I will <em>not</em> be denied <em>again!</em>" I snatched a Blood Blade out of thin air and swung it against the wall.

The blade glanced off the wall's infinite smoothness. But I wasn't done. With my next heartbeat, another blade pulsed into my other hand. I whirled around, slashing both my blades against the wall, but every time they slid away.

"You can't ignore me forever!!" I yelled at the wall.

"Tell me when you are done trying to intimidate a god," said Justicar tiredly.

There was much more I could do than just smacking it with a couple of sticks. With each heartbeat, I allowed more power to pulse into me. The Blood Blades merged into my arms – there was no longer just a hand gripping a handle, but a single, long, bladed arm, glowing red with heat. I whipped them against the wall, not trying to cut so much as to splatter and bludgeon. With each swing, extra droplets of blood sprayed in every direction around me, and pooled, sizzling, like an acid trying to eat away at the walls and floor.

A short distance away, Justicar manifested a glass barrier to keep herself clean. My blood burned through it like it was tissue paper.

But the wall was still utterly smooth, impervious to everything I was throwing at it. I couldn't just keep beating on at aimlessly. I needed <em>leverage</em>. What could I push off of? If I wanted to hit the wall harder, I'd have to brace myself against something in the other direction, and the only thing in the other direction was –

The opposite wall of the tunnel.

I called the power into myself again. I turned my body into one long, lean, mass of muscle. My legs stretched out, growing into powerful hindclaws. More blades sprouted from my back, forming jagged ridges like shredded wings. With every new blade that grew out of me, I braced myself more and more against the opposite wall.

And then, I made my weapon. I focused a Blood Blade down to a single point, a vividly sharp, hard, exacting spike. I gripped a long handle in both hands, aiming it straight-on into the wall. I heaved my full strength into it with no worry that it could slip left or right.

My spike bit into the wall.

It felt like a distant scream. A wave of energy passed over me, an aching splash of color at the edges of my vision. Near me, I saw Justicar raise a hand in front of her face, as if protecting herself from an unseen force.

"What are you doing?!" Justicar yelled.

I grinned savagely. If the Seeking God was in pain, that meant I was winning. I heaved again, flexing and straining with every muscle along the length of my body. The screaming exploded into my ears, like a jackhammer, and gong, and a crying baby rolled into one. Reality flickered around me, becoming a mass of discordant color and stench.

"That's enough!" shouted Justicar. "Stop this immediately!" She stepped forward, her sword bouncing at her side as she summoned a shard of white light in her hands. I could <em>feel</em> her light as a blank spot in my thunderhead of rage. If that light touched me, it would scrub away my strength, erase everything I was fighting for.

Before she could get to me, I heaved a final time.

The world shattered.

<bigbreak>

I stumbled and landed on my hands and knees.

What had just happened? I looked around. It looked like a pretty normal place, as much as any part of the Seeking God's world was normal. [????? Medium length description of a weird room/landscape]

I summoned the map in my hand. With a sinking feeling [????? can it be the feeling where you're desperately looking for some information while you expect that the information will be something that hurts you?], [????? I zeroed in on the Watchful Eye. It was very far away].

"I'LL KILL YOU!!!" I snatched up one of the rocks in my hand, and, imagining that it was the Seeking God, I smashed it to pieces. Then I sprouted a Blood Blade from my heel and stomped on the broken rock, slicing it into smaller and smaller slivers. "YOU THINK YOU CAN JERK ME AROUND, LIKE THIS IS ALL A BIG GAME?! I AM BLEEDING ON THE FLOOR, AND YOU STILL USE MY HEART AS A PLAYTHING?! I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A GOD! I WILL TEAR YOU TO PIECES!" I whirled around, my arm whipping into a long blade with a bleeding edge, my eyes trying to zero in on whatever looked most like the heart of the god.

But when my eyes began to make sense of what I saw, it was only [????? a bunch of stuff]. And among the [????? stuff], the frozen, terrified face of the Alchemist.
