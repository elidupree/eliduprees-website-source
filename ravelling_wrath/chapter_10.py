Up ahead of us was a big room where the floor was divided into a square grid, with each square about a meter wide. A lot of the squares had glass walls rising up from them, forming smaller rooms and hallways within the big gid. Other squares were missing, leaving pits going down into the floor. Still other squares had doors, buttons, levers, and other devices I didn't recognize.

?????

"The walls are made of glass so that we can see the whole puzzle at once."

?????

"Holy shit, that was badass!" I said.

"Please move," said Justicar tightly, the flames still rolling off of her.

"Uh, right," I said shakily. I moved back. Justicar stepped out of the flames. She concentrated, and the remaining smoke blew away from her armor, leaving it shining as bright as new.

"So are you, like, immune to fire? Or, wait, did you just manifest it away from you? But the god doesn't let us manifest on parts of the puzzle –"

"The Stern God's will protects me from all forms of physical harm. This armor is only a physical representation of that will." She looked at the puzzle ahead of us. "It appears that there are more corridors blocked off by the flames. So that is the first rule of this puzzle: Only the Justicar can stand safely in the flames. For us both to get past those corridors, I will have to block the flames while you run past."

"Yeah, okay," I said.

"The question is, how will we get past the dead end directly in front of us?"

Sure enough,
 
?????


"The lower gods act without thinking. The upper gods tarry in thought without taking meaningful action. Only the Stern, which stands in the middle, has the [????? balance necessary to run a society]. That is why the Stern Temple controls three fifths of the city, and why the Stern God ?????, despite what it lacks in raw power."

"Lacks in raw power? I thought all the gods were equally powerful."

"No. For one, the Broken God's power vastly exceeds that of all the others. Among the others, the Waiting God has the most, but rarely uses it. Then comes the Blood God – or <em>would</em> come, had it not [????? been deprived of rejuvenation; but phrase it in a way that sounds approving]. The Stern God is second to last, and last is the Seeking, which spends its power frivolously." Justicar waved an arm, indicating the elaborate puzzles all around us.

"How come you and Yali get to know all kinds of stuff about the gods? The Blood God never told <em>me</em> anything cool."

"This knowledge does not come from the Stern God directly. I simply paid attention in divinity class, [????? after I changed]."

"Fuck you."
