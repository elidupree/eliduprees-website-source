  [????? what chapter?: about Justicar, "just because you're right sometimes about telling other people not to do stuff, doesn't mean the REST of your opinions are right". Also, "hey! <em>Yali</em>'s responsible too! I've got nothing against responsible people telling me what to do, [it's just you in particular]!"]
  
[????? early in this chapter: Justicar predicts that they will not find Yali, reasoning about Yali being too willing to give answers]

"I do not expect that we will," said Justicar.

"You kidding me? Let me guess, it's because I'd like that, and nothing I like is allowed to happen."

"The law of the Seeking is to challenge us with riddles. What do you think would happen if your Farseer were here? Although she –"

"She's not 'my Farseer', she's my girlfriend!"

"– Although she is wise for her years, she is still young. She has not fully realized that the virtue of restraint – to ?????, not to use the Waiting God's knowledge for every idle pursuit. So if she were with us –"

"You're saying she'd give us the answers too easily."

"Yes. It would contradict the will of the Seeking, so the Seeking will not allow it. If it has shown her location to us, it must have a different reason. We <em>may</em> reach her in a physical sense, but even if we do, it will be another layer of the Seeking God's game, not the happy reunion you are imagining."

"Well fuck you too. <em>I</em> say after I do these puzzles, the Seeking will reward me by letting me get – letting me see my fucking girlfriend. Rewards are part of a puzzle too, you know!"

"You can believe what you like."

[????? Somewhere in this chapter: noticing that the type of puzzles is dependent on who is running into them]

[????? Somewhere in this chapter: Justicar saying that her understanding of "the laws by which each god/world functions" gives her an advantage]


[????? Where: "The Stern God asks that I consider the Farseer's guidance, but not become dependent on it."]

[????? somewhere in this chapter: Justicar's parents and the big decision]


Up ahead of us was a big room where the floor was divided into a square grid, with each square about a meter wide. A lot of the squares had glass walls rising up from them, forming smaller rooms and hallways within the big grid. Other squares were missing, leaving pits going down into the floor. Still other squares had doors, buttons, levers, and other devices I didn't recognize.

I pressed my face to one of the glass walls. "I feel like I'm in an aquarium," I said. "Gotta say, the Seeking God's got style."

"Style, perhaps, but it also serves a function. I expect that the walls are made of glass so that we can see the whole puzzle at once. It allows us to examine the puzzle before jumping into anything –"

Well, if she was going to say <em>that</em>, I knew what I had to do. "Alright, time to jump into things!!" I said cheerfully. I danced out onto the floor of the main puzzle area. I was planning to mess with one of the levers, but the glass walls were actually blocking off most of them. "Wonder what those are?" I said, waving my arm at a nozzle sticking out of one of the walls.

Just then, the room roared to life. ????? ?????verbed and jets of flame spouted out of the nozzles on the walls. One of the jets was zooming right towards me. I was too startled to react.

Justicar was quicker. Right away, she leapt in between me and the source of the flames. The flames deflected off of her armor, shooting off at wide angles and dispersing into the air.

"Holy shit, that was badass!" I said.

"Please move," said Justicar tightly, the flames still rolling off of her.

"Uh, right," I said shakily. I moved back out of range. Justicar stepped out of the flames. She concentrated, and the remaining smoke blew away from her armor, leaving it shining as bright as new.

"So is that armor, like, fireproof? Or, wait, did you just manifest the fire away from you? But the god doesn't let us manifest on parts of the puzzle –" Even just standing <em>near</em> the flames felt really hot, and trying to manifest my skin to be cooler didn't help at all. It just made me feel cold <em>and</em> hot.

"The Stern God's will protects me from all forms of physical harm. This armor is only a physical representation of that will." She looked at the puzzle ahead of us. "It appears that there are more corridors blocked off by the flames. So that is the first rule of this puzzle: Only the Justicar can stand safely in the flames. For us both to get past those corridors, I will have to block the flames while you run past."

"Yeah, okay," I said.

"The question is, how will we get past the dead end directly in front of us? That lever must open a new passage, but how –"

Ahead of us, the glass walls funneled us into a short hallway, and at the end of the hallway, there was a lever. But before the lever, there was a giant hole in the floor, cutting completely across the hall.

I sized up the hole. "I could jump that, easy."

"Maybe, but the puzzle might –"

I took off running and jumped clean over the hole. I grabbed the lever and gave it a good heave, smirking. Then I jumped back over the hole as a wall slid open somewhere. "That was easy," I said. "You could probably jump it, too. Even with that armor, it's not –"

"I sincerely doubt that my <em>physical</em> abilities are what matters here. But I will try it, if only to illustrate." Justicar geared up to make a big jump, sprang upwards, and… barely got off the ground. "As I thought. The pit would have no reason to be there if it functions no differently than an empty floor. So that is the second rule of the puzzle: only the Blood Child can cross gaps."

?????


[????? While I was waiting for Justicar to finish her side, I] idly manifested a brick wall to block the fire in front of me. I knew it wasn't going to <em>work</em>, I was just curious to see what would happen. Sure enough, the flames shot right through it. It didn't even burn – it just didn't block the flames at all.

Justicar spotted what I was doing. "I told you," she said patiently, "the Seeking God has set its rules for these puzzles. There will not be a clever trick to bypass them."

"I thought the Seeking God was the <em>god</em> of clever tricks," I muttered.

"And thus, it is within the Seeking God's authority to determine <em>which</em> puzzles may be answered with clever tricks, and which may not."

"Hmph."

?????

[Probably down time where Rinn starts engaging Justicar about Justicar's beliefs]

"[????? Any of you Stern hypocrites]. I've had enough of that back on Earth. Mom and Dad thinking they can control me, teachers acting like they know shit about what's good for me…"

"Even if they are truly hypocrites – which perhaps they are! – you should not be so quick to discard the wisdom of the Stern simply because of their human failings. In truth, very few who claim to follow the Stern truly uphold its ideals."

"I bet <em>you</em> do, though," I said sarcastically.

"It would be arrogance for me to claim that I am certain of my own virtue –"

"Oh, quit being humble and tell the truth. You think you're hot shit. You're some kind of perfect Stern stick-in-the-mud –"

"I am far from perfect," said Justicar severely.

[Maybe Justicar believes that Rinn is going down the wrong path because Rinn's parents haven't been good Stern role models, so Justicar should try to be that]

"I was not so different from you once. I [????? thought the world belonged to me? Multiple examples]."

"parties with underage drinking"

"Sure, I've been to some of those. Only we didn't call them 'parties with underage drinking', we called them 'parties'." I manifested a glass of beer and whooped. I was mostly just messing with her. Normally, getting drunk just made me feel bad. But now… I felt plenty shitty already. I was stuck between Justicar's preaching on one side and the Blood God's grinding impatience on the other. I felt like my head was full of voices yelling at me from all sides. Maybe the alcohol would make them all just <em>shut up</em> for once. I downed my beer angrily, then followed it up with another. As I filled the glass a third time, Justicar put her hand on my wrist and stopped me.

The beer sat uncomfortably in my belly. Stern take it, I should have thought about the fact that I was technically drinking on an empty stomach. And I couldn't stand how Justicar was looking at me. As much as I had gotten a kick out of making her think I was a heavy drinker, I was kind of regretting it now. "I, uh, I don't usually do this," I said awkwardly. "The truth is, I hardly ever actually drink. Look at me – I'm tiny. I go from zero to wasted in, like, ONE beer." The first time I had ever gotten drunk, I had tried to kiss an older girl – and <em>missed</em>, and smashed my face into the table next to her. At least, that's what I heard from the other girls who had to take care of me and drive me home, while I kept hitting on them even though I couldn't sit up straight and had a huge bruise on my face. So a couple weeks later I went back to the next party with the same crowd, and that time I stayed completely sober while I went up to the same girl and started making out with her in front of everyone. And then she had taken me up to her room, and… haha, good times.

"You can use manifesting to stop being drunk," said Justicar.

"Well, I've come this far. Let's, uh, get this party started." I manifested some big speakers and a new copy of my phone, plugged them together, and started blasting some upbeat party music. I picked a song with a strong beat and a sexy voice. As soon as it came on, I wanted to jump up and start dancing, even though it was just me and Justicar here. So I did. I grabbed Justicar's wrist and tried to pull her up with me, but she wouldn't budge.

"Fiiiiine, be that way," I said. I happily started bobbing my head up and down to the beat. Pretty soon, the music started glitching in and out. Right, the speakers I'd manifested were some old ones my dad had from, like, last century. They were flaky as shit. I was about to give them a good kick when I noticed Justicar glancing at them and twitching. Well, if <em>she</em> was annoyed –

Before long, Justicar manifested a different pair of speakers and re-plugged them. The music sounded fine now. Well, worked for me.

I strutted and spun across the floor, my body pumping with the pulse of the music. "Don't tell me you don't know how to enjoy yourself," I laughed in Justicar's direction.

"Is that all you see in a party like this one you are mimicking? A harmless way to enjoy yourself?"

Why did she have to make everything into some sort of serious issue? "Like <em>you'd</em> know anything about it," I snapped.

"On the contrary, I know far too much. When I was your age, I went to parties like this nearly every weekend. I constantly lied to my parents about where I had been and how late I had stayed out."

"You're bullshitting me."

Justicar sighed. "I am a Justicar. I cannot lie. I cannot speak any statement I do not believe to be true. [????? So you can be certain it's true when I say this: I did not respect myself.] I was a heavy drinker. I literally cannot count the times that I drank until I was blacked out or vomiting on the floor. My friends tried to stop me, but I persisted, even knowing that I was making them clean up after me. I ruined my relationships with them, one by one."

I swayed. How could that be the same person as Justicar? I almost wondered if she had lied about not being able to lie. But it didn't <em>feel</em> like a lie. What was I supposed to think? The beer was starting to kick in, it was hard to get my thoughts in order.

Justicar went on. "But even as my life fell apart, I refused to understand that it was myself who had made that happen. I had been a star student, working hard and earning top marks, but I took it for granted. I always wanted more. To fill that void, I reached out in every direction except the one that would actually restore me. I reached for every kind of drug I could get my hands on, I had sex with many different men –"

Well <em>that</em> I knew how to respond to. "Haha, that's where you went wrong. Shoulda had sex with girls instead."

Justicar looked a little frustrated.

"You got a problem with that? With me liking girls?"

Justicar sighed. "I won't rise to your provocation."

"So you <em>do</em> have a problem with it!" I said triumphantly.

"I am not homophobic!" said Justicar angrily. She struggled to find the right words. "It didn't matter <em>who</em> I was having sex with! I –"

"And, liiiiike, you say you 'had sex' with these men when you were totally wasted. Isn't that, like, rape?"

"I put myself in that situation willingly."

"What, like you got wasted specifically to have sex with some dude?"

"No, but it doesn't matter if –"

"Then I don't see how it was consensual," I concluded.

Justicar glared at me. "Are you so eager to avoid taking responsibility for your actions that you must see victimhood everywhere, even when I tell you myself that I was not a victim?"

"What the fuck! Of course I take responsibility for my actions! When I hurt someone else, that's my responsibility. When someone else hurts me, that's their responsibility. It's not that complicated!"

"So, according to you, any time you have sex with a drunk person, that's rape?"

"Uh, generally," I said. I felt like she was trying to pin me down with some sort of clever logic. And I wasn't sure all of the girls <em>I'd</em> been with had been totally sober at the time, so that was a little uncomfortable.

"Then you could just as well say that <em>I</em> raped some of those <em>men</em>."

"Haha, maybe you did! Did you check in with them afterwards or anything? It's not like they'd come up to you the next day and be like, 'By the way, Justicar,' or whatever your real name is, 'you actually traumatized me last night, just so you know'!"

Justicar was smiling – the smile of someone who's being patient with a little kid who's talking nonsense. Stern take it, if I wanted to get through to her, I couldn't just keep saying the first thing that came into my head, even if it wasn't wrong. "So, what, do you think drunk girls are just asking for it?!" I snapped.

"If you would give me a chance to explain the actual principles I follow, you would know I do not believe anything like that. It is always wrong to force yourself on someone else. But no one forced themselves on me. It was my own choice to devalue my body like that. I <em>chose</em> to fill my nights with sexual indiscretions, to distract myself from how I was squandering the true worth of my life. I had no self-respect."

Up to this point, I had mostly just been messing with her. But now… a terrible ache pulled at my heart. This was deadly serious. Her words were a violation, a gaping wound, trying to twist my blood out of its course. Coldly, I stated, "That's your <em>real</em> problem. It's not the sex. It's not the drinking. It's the self-respect. But –" I made a fist in front of my heart "– <em>I've</em> got <em>loads</em> of self-respect. If anyone doesn't treat me right, they can fuck right off. And if they don't fuck right off, I <em>make</em> them. I'm nothing like you."

Justicar raised an eyebrow. "When I was your age, I too believed that I was being assertive and empowered."

Ugh, what was even the point of being serious with her? She was just going to keep saying fucked-up stuff either way. "Yeah, so, maybe I'm in denial. Or maybe you're just wrong. You ever think about that??"

"You can believe what you like," she said.

?????

"?????? Of course I'm never going to do ?????! That shit fucks you up! I mean, not that you're fucked up because you did ?????. <em>You're</em> fucked up for completely unrelated reasons," I said, jabbing my finger into the chest plate of her armor. "Ow, that hurts."

"Please stop being drunk," said Justicar wearily.

"Yeah, orrrrrrrr, <em>you</em> could <em>start</em> being drunk," I said. I manifested a wine glass and pressed it to her lips.

Justicar's hand struck the glass violently, shattering it to pieces.

"Woah…" Fuck, I was really drunk now. Belatedly, I pulled my hand away. It was bleeding from the broken glass, but I didn't really feel it. Languidly, I looked up at Justicar, and saw her shaking with anger. "What's the matter?" I mumbled.

"You will not take away the life I have taken back!" she shouted. A bright white light blazed from her in all directions, stabbing at my eyes and feeling like it was shining right through my chest. My drunkenness was stripped away from me, my mind forced to clear again. "Now heal your hand and stop this foolishness!" she ordered.

"Fine!" I made my cuts close. "But seriously, what is your problem? Why'd you have to –"

"You have no idea how much I have had to sacrifice to get away from that life! You treat this as a game – just as I did! You have no idea of the depths to which one can sink!

????? I woke up in the hospital after an overdose. Even then, I refused to believe it was over. Not until my parents walked in. They did not listen to my excuses. They simply <em>told</em> me that I would be going to the Borson School from then on –"

"Isn't that that place that was in the news for abusing all those kids??"

"You are thinking of Bolsard Academy, in ?????. They are unrelated institutions."

"Er… oh."

"As I was saying, they simply told me of their decision. They did not give me a choice that I could ?????mismake. And for once, I did not try to fight it. On some level, I was aware of how badly my actions were destroying my life. I would never have been able to make that decision myself.

"By the time I was able to leave the hospital, my bags were already packed. They drove me directly to the new school. We did not stop at my home. I was not even allowed a moment with my phone to say goodbye to the few friends who would still talk to me –"

"That's horrible," I breathed.

"It was exactly what I needed. A clean break from the world of the self-destructive habits I had developed."

"But–! You… Argh!"

"At the Borson School, nothing was done for us. We students had to do our own laundry, to clean our own dormitories.

?????

"So," I said, summing things up, "what I'm hearing is, first, your life sucked. And then you 'found the Stern'. And now, your life still sucks. When was the last time you enjoyed yourself?"

"It is not important whether I enjoy myself. What is important is whether I stay true to my principles."

Another puzzle


?????

[????? Rinn assumes that Justicar would approve of anything done in the name of the Stern, and Justicar reveals that she was a police officer]

"You assume, simply because a thing was done in the name of the Stern, that I would approve of it. But as I said, not all who claim to follow the Stern truly uphold its principles. Even the highest ranks of the Stern Temple are full of – have their share of hypocrites ?????

"After I graduated from the Borson School, I was given a second chance at life – a privilege that not everyone receives. I wanted to make the most of what I had been given. I wanted to give back to society. I began training to enter the Stern police force."

?????

"I was a star student once again. [????? authority figures] praised my hard work and sense of duty. Hypocrites, all of them.

proud to serve in an organization dedicated to upholding the will of the Stern. How foolish I was, assuming that the humans who worked for the Stern Temple would respect to the will of the Stern as I did.	I was asked to overlook bias and petty corruption. [????? Bias in favor of rich people] simply because they could create trouble for us. Did we not follow the Stern? Did we not have a duty to enforce the law impartially, regardless of any risk it might bring upon us? ?????

"Or, as I prefer to see it, I was dismissed from the police force <em>for enforcing the law</em>." She smiled grimly. "And now it seems that the god itself has vindicated me."

?????

I had an idea. I waited for Justicar to [????? do something with the puzzle]…

"Hey, Havi!"

"Yes?" said Justicar. Then she whirled around angrily. "How did you know my name?!"

"This was a few years ago, right? You had a whole post about it! You were all like 'The so-called Stern Temple are a DEN OF HYPOCRITES!' and 'They will remember the name of Havi ????? until –'"

"Please don't remind me."

"I remember because Dehel kept reposting it from a meme page. He always reposted it with just a whole bunch of thinking face emoji. Haha, I think it was actually called <em>The Blood God's Dank Meme Stash –</em> man, that was so three years ago." I sensed that Justicar was trying not to listen. "Wait a minute, why don't you want to be reminded about this?! You were kickass!"

"I gave in to my selfish resentment. It was not the appropriate way for me to air my grievances with the Stern Temple."

"Ugh, you're so Stern that even when you hate the Stern you have to be more Stern than they are??"

[????? how can the law be pure when it's also made by humans?]

[????? Finishing up the puzzle]
?????
<bigbreak>

We were in the elevator again, taking a brief rest as we got close to the end of a long chain of puzzles. How many days had we been at this now?

Justicar was sitting straight-backed as usual, staring straight ahead, while I slouched against the wall of the elevator. I was seriously sick of being stuck with her. She never just talked about shit like my real friends did. I felt isolated, craving any sort of connection. But all I had was her. And the more I learned about her, the less I liked. She had been a <em>cop</em>! An actual <em>cop</em>!

But even though I had my phone back, I was long since bored of all the games I had on it. Messing with Justicar was the only entertainment I still had.

"So…" I said, trying to sound sly but probably just sounding like an asshole, "when you were a cop, how many people did you put in prison?" I couldn't resist asking her that. I just <em>knew</em> she was going to come up with some reason not to answer.

Sure enough, she completely avoided it. "Police officers do not 'put people in prison'. It is judges and juries who determine sentencing."

This was gonna be good. I quickly tried to plan out all the ways I could keep messing with her. But then, another thought shot through me, a much more serious thought. "<em>Now</em> who's not taking responsibility for their actions?!" I demanded. "You arrest people, then they go to prison. And somehow that doesn't count??"

"We each do our own part in the system, and only our own part. If a conviction is unjust, that cannot be laid at the feet of officers who were only carrying out their duties."

"Are you kidding me!! If I throw someone in a pit full of vipers, do you think I get to say, 'oh, it's not my fault, I'M not the one who put those vipers in that pit'!?! Or do you want to lay the blame where it fucking belongs?"

????? [????? "or maybe I don't care about order as much as I care about people's lives!"] [

"Very well." Justicar opened her arms. "If you want to hold me individually responsible for every violent act ever performed in the name of the Stern, perhaps <em>I</em> should hold <em>you</em> responsible for the damage caused by <em>your</em> ideology."

"And what's that?"

"The collapse of society. Mass starvation. Gangs slaughtering each other in the streets."

"Oh yeah? When did that happen?"

"The only reason it has not happened is the fact that <em>the Stern are still in control</em>. What would happen if we put a child like yourself in charge of society? You claim to value people's lives above order [????? set that up], but that is a contradiction, because order is the way that people's lives are preserved. If the laws against shoplifting cannot be enforced, then shoplifting will run rampant. If people can steal things as easily as buy them, how will stores make money? If stores cannot make money, who will be incentivized to import goods into the city? Food?"

"I mean, if I'm in charge, I can just tell someone to import food into the city."

"Because you have seen how a tower is shaped, you imagine that you could tear one down and build another from the ruins without any tools.

?????

"You're good at making yourself sound smart, but you're not," I said aggressively. "It's all just a bunch of fancy words to try and justify what you Stern do to people. Why don't you just be honest and beat us up like the others?!"

"That is not –"

"I grew up down the street from that kid!" I shouted over her. ?????, but a righteous rage was building in my chest. "[????? Name]! He went to prison for stealing a $50 pair of headphones! He was sixteen, just like I am now! No corrupt cop beat him up! It was legal! Everything they did to him was legal! They gave him twelve months in jail! A year of his life, GONE! For a $50 pair of headphones!!" My face was hot, tears springing to my eyes. What was I feeling? I had never really cared about ????? Name before – in fact, I'd always thought he was kind of a dumbass. But it was like I had suddenly woken up to how <em>wrong</em> it was. All the pain, the humiliation of being trapped by a system that never cared for him. It had opened the lid to a bottomless well of pain and rage. I couldn't stop ripping into Justicar with my words, straining my throat just to spit out the barest shadow of what it would take to set things right. "He got out last year, and he just hasn't been the same! He doesn't want to talk about it, he just clams up! You think maybe he was traumatized there, just a little?!"

"If he was abused in prison, that is <em>not</em> the will of the Stern! You cannot blame –"

"Prison IS abuse, Justicar! You think you're innocent?! A year of life! That's what your Temple took away! Was that a worthy sacrifice for your order?! Your precious <em>principles</em> destroy people's LIVES, Justicar! Don't you dare call me the evil one!"

Justicar sighed.

"Just the manifesto I would expect from a Blood Child," she said. "Full of passion and fury, lacking in consideration and foresight."

Rage surged up in me. I wanted to punch the smug indifference right off her face. But my heart was weighed down with a heavy thought: <em>this is not my true enemy</em>. That was <em>definitely</em> the Blood God again, not me. Why was it thinking <em>that</em>? Whatever. I settled with just yelling again. "Did you listen to a word I just said?!" I demanded.

"The law is not naive," said Justicar, oblivious to the struggle inside me. "Judges can, and do, let common thieves go without prison time, when the circumstances allow. If your friend was given twelve months, he may have been a repeat offender, or –"

"Like that changes anything! If he stole a few more times! He could have stolen a $50 pair of headphones <em>every day for the enire year</em> and it still wouldn't be worth as much as what you sacrificed!"

"And still your solution is to erase the law and justice system that we have. How very like the Blood God."

"Ya know, I wasn't a fan of the Blood God before, but the more you talk, the more I think maybe it's got some good ideas."

"You will not find your enlightenment down that road," said Justicar. She continued, speaking like she was reciting a practiced statement. "The lower gods act without thinking. The upper gods tarry in thought, rarely taking meaningful action. Only the Stern, which stands in the middle, has the balance necessary to administrate a society. That is why the Stern Temple officially controls three fifths of the city, and why –"

"Wait a minute. Three fifths?"

"The Waiting Temple has formal authority over the first layer. The Seeking Temple, the second. And the Stern Temple is based in the third layer, but also has authority over the fourth and the fifth –"

"– the fifth layer, which <em>should</em> go with the Blood Temple," I finished instinctively.

"Which <em>did</em> belong to the Blood Temple before its collapse and dissolution." Something about that description felt completely unfair. But I couldn't figure out how to express it, so I just glared at her while she continued. "But the Blood Temple was disorganized and corrupt. As I was saying, only the Stern is capable of the organization the city needs. That is why the Stern Temple was given the lower layers, and why the Stern God maintains equal influence in the Ravelling, despite what it lacks in raw power."

"Lacks in…? I thought all the gods were equally powerful!"

"No. For one, the Broken God's power vastly exceeds that of all the others." That <em>did</em> sound sort of familiar. "Among the others, the Waiting God has the most, but rarely uses it. Then comes the Blood God – or <em>would</em> come, had it not [????? been deprived of rejuvenation; but phrase it in a way that sounds approving]. The Stern God is second to last, and last is the Seeking, which spends its power frivolously." Justicar waved an arm, indicating the elaborate puzzles all around us.

"How come you and Yali get to know all kinds of stuff about the gods? The Blood God never told <em>me</em> anything cool."

"This knowledge does not come from the Stern God. At least, not directly. Once I found the Stern… I simply learned to pay attention in Divinity class."

"Fuck you too."

We were interrupted by the elevator coming to a stop.

<bigbreak>

The great doors slid open, revealing the final puzzle.

The room in front of us much smaller than the others. I checked the map. "This has got to be the last puzzle before we get to Yali!!" I said excitedly, trying to just be happy about that and forget my raw conflict with Justicar. I could practically <em>feel</em> her being skeptical behind me. Well, screw her anyway.

The puzzle in front of us looked really simple. Justicar and I were forced into separate corridors – there was one that you could only enter if you jumped, and one that you could only enter if you walked through fire. On my side, there was a closed door, then a room full of perpetually roaring flames. On Justicar's side, there was also a closed door, but in front of it, there was a button. There was also a place on my side where the corridor branched off, but it just led to a dead end with another flamethrower in it. Why?

"Guess you've got to stand on that button," I said. "I'm literally looking at a closed door here. I can't do anything. "

"Understood." Justicar stood on the button. The door on <em>my</em> side slid open, and the flames disappeared from the room beyond. Continuing the routine, she stepped off again to see whether it would stay that way, but it didn't – the doorway closed again and the flames came back. Then she stepped back on, switching them again.

"Ooooo-kay…" I said. "I guess I'm going to walk into the fire room now. You better not step off that button."

"Understood," said Justicar tiredly.

Tentatively, I poked my feet into the room. Now that the flames were gone, I could see what was inside. But it wasn't much. On the far wall, the only exit was another closed door. In the middle of the floor, there was another button. "I guess I'm going to stand on this button," I said. "That's literally the only thing we can do. There's no way the Seeking God we give us an <em>easy</em> puzzle at this point, is there…?"

Not thinking of anything else to do, I stood on the button. The door on Justicar's side slid open.

<bigbreak>

"This is completely useless!" I yelled in frustration. We had been talking about the puzzle for ages, but it still seemed impossible. The <em>only</em> way to open the door on Justicar's side was for me to stand on the button in the fire room. But if Justicar wanted to walk <em>through</em> that door, she'd have to step <em>off</em> the button that was turning the fire off. And then I'd be locked in the room and barbecued. That was probably bad, although it was seeming more tempting by the minute.

"There must be something we've missed…" muttered Justicar.

"Like what, a secret switch that lets us skip the puzzle?"

"No. These puzzles are about applying the established rules in new ways the solver may not think of. The god would not change the rules this late in the sequence."

"Wait, why not? I mean, I was being sarcastic, but maybe we actually <em>should</em> look for –"

"Though it may seem random, the Seeking God does everything with a purpose. If the puzzles have built up to this point, it must have a lesson for us that is more complex than a simple deception. It would waste the potential of the situation."

"Fine, but if you haven't figured out what the lesson <em>is</em>, I'm going to look for a secret switch, just in case."

"Suit yourself."

I searched all up and down the walls. There wasn't much to search. I felt like Morrow from the room with the clock. Eventually, I just started pacing around and staring irritably at the various parts of the puzzle.

?????

"What I <em>really</em> don't get is this extra flamethrower over here on my side," I said. "It doesn't <em>do</em> anything. It's literally just down a dead end, not blocking off anything!"

"In that case, it is irrelevant to the puzzle. It may be intended as a distraction."

"It's out of place, though. There haven't been distractions like this before… It's gotta mean something!"

I walked up close to the spurting flames. I tried to look at them from every angle, hoping I'd notice something new. But it didn't look different than any of the others. Unless there was something different about the nozzle itself – it was kind of hard to see from where I was standing. To get to it, I'd have to walk through the flames, and this one was always on – none of the buttons turned it off. So…

"Wait. I have an idea! Something this flamethrower could be meant for!" A thrill shot through me. I stepped towards the flames.
 
"What are you doing?" said Justicar.

I brought my hand close to the fire. It felt burning hot, as if getting any closer would burn my hand to cinders. But I pressed on, bringing it closer and closer. The fire stayed hot. But it <em>didn't get hotter</em>. Before long, my fingertips were brushing the edge of the flame itself, and I hadn't been burned yet. I turned my hand around, and my fingers looked fine. There wasn't a mark on them – they looked the same color as the rest of my skin.

When I really concentrated, really paid attention to how they felt… they weren't even <em>warm</em>.

"Stop that!" said Justicar. She probably still thought I was playing with <em>real</em> fire.

I smirked. With a flourish, I jumped into the center of the flames. Then I turned around and leaned my back against the spurting source of the fire, stretching and yawning as if I was relaxing in a hot spring or something. It actually hurt a lot, but it was worth it to watch Justicar panic. "I <em>get it now!</em>" I said. "This one was here to <em>teach</em> me! To teach me that none of the flamethrowers ever mattered! I could have walked through them all along!"

And it wasn't even just that I would have to <em>walk</em> into the flames. In this puzzle, <em>I</em> didn't have to do anything except stand in the middle of the fire room helplessly, while <em>Justicar</em> had to turn it on.

Justicar must have realized the same thing, because she immediately tensed up. "That cannot be what we have to do! There must be something else!"

?????

"But if they are only an illusion… if you will not actually be harmed…"

"Actually, it still hurts a lot. I was just pretending earlier."

"Then there must be another way! Even if the flames do not actually injure you, that only means that the Seeking God did not want to injure you simply because you broke the rules. But they still represent an impassable barrier! The puzzle will have a more proper solution –"

I grinned savagely. "No, it won't! You said it yourself! If there was a way to get out of this, it would <em>waste that potential of the situation</em> –"

Justicar glared at me.

"I take back everything bad I ever said about the Seeking God, this is great! You're going to have to admit that you were wrong! You were wrong from the very beginning!"

Justicar sighed. "If it comes to that, do you think I will have difficulty admitting that I was wrong? No one can be correct every time. The Stern asks that we remain humble and admit to our mistakes when they do occur."

"Oh, you're no fun."

<bigbreak>

We didn't find any other solution, of course. Justicar took forever to convince herself, but she finally gave in.

Now, she was standing on her button, and I on the button in the fire room, about to do what we had to.

"You are sure you're ready for this?"

"'course I am."

Justicar closed her eyes. With a strained voice, she recited, "<em>Let me strike when I must strike, even if it costs my life; but let me yield when I must yield, even if it costs my pride.</em>"

"Oh, get on with it," I said. I knew I was safe, but just standing here waiting to be torched was giving me the jitters.

Justicar sprinted towards the open door on her side. I didn't see much after that, because there were flames all around me. Searing pain struck at the entire surface of my skin. It actually felt kind of kickass, standing proudly in the middle of the inferno, tensing my whole body to resist the pain.

Moments later, the flames fizzled away. The door out of the fire room was open in front of me.

"Blood Child, are you all right?" said Justicar anxiously.

I couldn't resist. I hunched over, pretending I was still in horrible pain.

"Tell me you're all right! You can come out of that room now! I've opened the exit! Come on out! Please! Rinn!!"

I straightened up, grinning. "You actually called me by my name!!"

Justicar relaxed immediately. "I should have known…" she muttered. "Just come over here."

I hurried out of the fire room. After the doors we had just gone through, the two sides of the puzzle joined together again, and there was only the final exit door left. It was another huge doorway, leading into a cylindrical tunnel, its walls shiny and black and perfectly smooth. The tunnel looked nothing like the series of puzzles we'd just done.

"Looks like we just finished the last puzzle! High-five!"

To my slight surprise, Justicar actually high-fived me back. "Yes, this is an accomplishment we can be proud of."

I headed for the exit, expecting Justicar to follow me.

"But there is still something I wonder," said Justicar dourly. "These puzzles were constructed for both of us. If you are correct, and the solution we used was the one the Seeking God intended, then I have to admit that it <em>did</em> have… some form of lesson for me. But then, surely, somewhere in this, there must also be a lesson for <em>you</em>?"

I smirked. "Nah, it just means I was right all along! I'm the one who thought, uh…" Actually, when I thought about it, I hadn't really disagreed with Justicar about anything. I had just sort of… gone along with… "Oh. My. GODS!! I can't believe it, I seriously can't believe it! I've gone this entire way, this ENTIRE way, acting like I hate the rules, like I think they're all bullshit! But when you told me what you thought the rules were – the <em>very first time you told me</em> – I BELIEVED you! I could have checked any time I wanted! I could have stuck my hand in the fire whenever I wanted to, and then I could have skipped past all the puzzles! But the Seeking God <em>knew</em> I wouldn't do it! It knew I would just –" the words came reluctantly to my lips "– <em>trust</em> you."

"An interesting thought, but how was that <em>my</em> rule? Anyone could have assumed th–"

I paced back and forth, not even listening to her. I COULDN'T get distracted! Now that I had this insight, I had to keep going, seeing everything it meant before I lost my train of thought! "I've been looking at this all wrong from the beginning! I've been doing all this petty shit just to annoy you – I've been treating you like you're just a <em>fact of life</em> that I'm fed up with! Every part of the Stern – I break the rules, I make fun of the teachers, but at the end of the day I go home and do my homework like it's just how things are! Would you believe that when I heard about ?????, the first thing I thought was 'what an idiot' because he got caught?! How!? How could I have been so – <em>victim-blaming</em>?! How could I have <em>believed in the Stern?!??</em>"

"That is not what 'belief in the Stern' m–"

"I will never believe in the Stern again! By my blood, not a single thing you do is just a <em>fact of life</em>. You're a –"

<em>– a monster who should never have been constructed.</em>

<em>– a poor, vulnerable human clinging to a lie.</em>

<em>– not my true enemy.</em>

"Oh? What am I?"

I clutched my head, trying to calm my warring thoughts. The feeling of insight was gone, leaving my mind in a jumble. Which part was me, and which part was the Blood God? Could they <em>all</em> be the Blood God? For fuck's sake, why wouldn't it just leave me OUT of its family squabbles? And now it was squabbling with <em>itself</em>, too?!

"I don't know. This is stupid. Never mind."

"No, you clearly had something to say. If you start something, you should finish it."

I stared back at her. I almost wanted to say something defensive, but if there was one thing I had just learned, it was that I really <em>didn't</em> have to listen to her. "Let's just go find Yali," I said tiredly.


The exit doorway was right in front of us, leading to a tunnel into the blackness.

?????


"Where are you going?" said Justicar.

"The tunnel's bending back! We're getting farther away from Yali this way!"

"You see? I told you the Seeking God would never allow us to reach the Farseer this way."

I kept looking at the map in my hand. Going too far in one direction took me further away from her. Going too far in the other direction also took me further away from her. I found the closest point, and glared at the wall there. On the map, the little Burning Heart and the little Watchful Eye were so close they were almost touching.

"She's right on the other side of this wall!!" I yelled. "I will <em>not</em> be denied <em>again!</em>" I snatched a Blood Blade out of thin air and swung it against the wall.

The blade glanced off the wall's infinite smoothness. But I wasn't done. With my next heartbeat, another blade pulsed into my other hand. I whirled around, slashing both my blades against the wall, but every time they slid away.

"You can't ignore me forever!!" I yelled at the wall.

"Tell me when you are done trying to intimidate a god," said Justicar tiredly.

There was much more I could do than just smacking it with a couple of sticks. With each heartbeat, I allowed more power to pulse into me. The Blood Blades merged into my arms – there was no longer just a hand gripping a handle, but a single, long, bladed arm, glowing red with heat. I whipped them against the wall, not trying to cut so much as to splatter and bludgeon. With each swing, extra droplets of blood sprayed in every direction around me, and pooled, sizzling, like an acid trying to eat away at the walls and floor.

A short distance away, Justicar manifested a glass barrier to keep herself clean. My blood burned through it like it was tissue paper.

But the wall was still utterly smooth, impervious to everything I was throwing at it. I couldn't just keep beating on at aimlessly. I needed <em>leverage</em>. What could I push off of? If I wanted to hit the wall harder, I'd have to brace myself against something in the other direction, and the only thing in the other direction was –

The opposite wall of the tunnel.

I called the power into myself again. I turned my body into one long, lean, mass of muscle. My legs stretched out, growing into powerful hindclaws. More blades sprouted from my back, forming jagged ridges like shredded wings. With every new blade that grew out of me, I braced myself more and more against the opposite wall.

And then, I made my weapon. I focused a Blood Blade down to a single point, a vividly sharp, hard, exacting spike. I gripped a long handle in both hands, aiming it straight-on into the wall. I heaved my full strength into it with no worry that it could slip left or right.

My spike bit into the wall.

It felt like a distant scream. A wave of energy passed over me, an aching splash of color at the edges of my vision. Near me, I saw Justicar raise a hand in front of her face, as if protecting herself from an unseen force.

"What are you doing?!" Justicar yelled.

I grinned savagely. If the Seeking God was in pain, that meant I was winning. I heaved again, flexing and straining with every muscle along the length of my body. The screaming exploded into my ears, like a jackhammer, and gong, and a crying baby rolled into one. Reality flickered around me, becoming a mass of discordant color and stench.

"That's enough!" shouted Justicar. "Stop this immediately!" She stepped forward, her sword bouncing at her side as she summoned a shard of white light in her hands. I could <em>feel</em> her light as a blank spot in my thunderhead of rage. If that light touched me, it would scrub away my strength, erase everything I was fighting for.

Before she could get to me, I heaved a final time.

The world shattered.

<bigbreak>

I stumbled and landed on my hands and knees.

What had just happened? I looked around. It looked like a pretty normal place, as much as any part of the Seeking God's world was normal. [????? Medium length description of a weird room/landscape]

I summoned the map in my hand. With a sinking feeling [????? can it be the feeling where you're desperately looking for some information while you expect that the information will be something that hurts you?], [????? I zeroed in on the Watchful Eye. It was very far away].

"I'LL KILL YOU!!!" I snatched up one of the rocks in my hand, and, imagining that it was the Seeking God, I smashed it to pieces. Then I sprouted a Blood Blade from my heel and stomped on the broken rock, slicing it into smaller and smaller slivers. "YOU THINK YOU CAN JERK ME AROUND, LIKE THIS IS ALL A BIG GAME?! I AM BLEEDING ON THE FLOOR, AND YOU STILL USE MY HEART AS A PLAYTHING?! I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A GOD! I WILL TEAR YOU TO PIECES!" I whirled around, my arm whipping into a long blade with a bleeding edge, my eyes trying to zero in on whatever looked most like the heart of the god.

But when my eyes began to make sense of what I saw, it was only [????? a bunch of stuff]. And among the [????? stuff], the frozen, terrified face of the Alchemist.
