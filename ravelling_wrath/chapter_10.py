[????? what chapter?: about Justicar, "just because you're right sometimes about telling other people not to do stuff, doesn't mean the REST of your opinions are right".]

[????? Somewhere in this chapter: Justicar saying that her understanding of "the laws by which each god/world functions" gives her an advantage]
  
It wasn't hard to get the others to follow along with me. Morrow was always going to follow wherever Alchemist went. Justicar was always going to follow the rest of us to "protect" us. And Alchemist… I wasn't really sure, but they moved to follow along as soon as I said where I was going. Maybe they wanted us all to get back together with Yali again, just like I did.

So we followed where the map let us. Morrow showed us a bunch more tricks for how to use it. Besides just moving to where you wanted to look at, you could also change it to highlight different landmarks. You could change the angle you were looking at things in 3D. And you could make the whole map disappear and reappear whenever you wanted, so it wasn't annoyingly floating around your hand all the time.

The way we were walking, more glass walkways stretched out over the void. At first, we were on a long straight one. But then it branched and expanded into a whole three-dimensional maze in the air, with different walkways curling around each other and joining in loops and stopping at dead ends in midair.

It got harder and harder to keep moving. We took what seemed like the obvious way forward, but then it twisted around and hit a dead end. Before long, it didn't seem like there was <em>any</em> way forward.

We split up and looked around.

Pretty soon, Morrow yelled out, "Check this!" I looked, and he was standing in front of a big… something like a ship's steering wheel. I hadn't spotted it earlier, because it was also made of glass and it blended in with all the handrails.

"What does it – Aaaaaahhhh!" I yelled as the floor moved under me. When I caught my balance, I saw what had happened. When Morrow spun the wheel, about half of the walkways also moved through the air to match.

Well, now we could reach a bunch of places we couldn't reach before. And as it turned out, a bunch of those places had <em>more</em> wheels that moved around <em>different</em> walkways. It was in elaborate puzzle, where you had to spin the wheels to just the right positions to get where you wanted. In fact, pretty soon there were places we could only get to by having <em>one</em> person spin a wheel while a <em>different</em> person waited on one of the walkways that was going to move. It was a puzzle for all of us to solve together.

Not that the four of us knew how to work together. Justicar stood back, thinking through everything logically and telling everyone else what to do. So of course, Morrow did the opposite, running around and spinning every wheel at random, pulling Alchemist along with him. Normally, I'd have been rooting for Morrow, just to piss off Justicar. But… this time I couldn't ignore my rising frustration. We <em>could</em> have been making progress towards <em>Yali</em>, and he was just running around messing it all up! And I also kept having surges of that confident feeling, which meant I was having Blood God thoughts and the loopy thing was shutting them down. It was a relief not to have them, but it actually felt pretty weird. It was kind of disrupting my train of thought.

So, as strange as it was, I ended up working with Justicar. We worked together to get past the parts that needed two of us to cooperate. And for the parts that needed three or four people working together, I tried to coax Morrow to play along.

<bigbreak>

"Hey, move it back!" I yelled.

Why had I ever tried to work with Morrow? [?????sentence too hard:] We'd just opened up a way for him to go on ahead, and when he got there, the first wheel he turned took away my only path away from where I was standing. And now he was cheerfully ignoring me. I was stuck on this one tiny section of walkway, floating in empty space. And the worst part was, I <em>understood</em> this puzzle now. Justicar and I had figured out exactly how to tell which wheels moved which walkways in which directions. And Morrow was the <em>only</em> person in a position to free me. The only thing I could think of was to jump, but all the other walkways looked too far away to reach.

Then again, it couldn't hurt to try, could it? None of the puzzles here had <em>actually</em> hurt me, even when I did stupid stuff. So I just took a flying leap off the platform, fell into the bottomless void, and landed back at the beginning of the puzzle like usual.

Except this time… it actually might be useful to solving the puzzle. It meant you could move the walkways in a way that trapped yourself, if it was useful for someone else. You could just trap yourself, then jump back to the beginning. Or at least, three of us could. Alchemist was too nervous to jump.

By taking advantage of that, Justicar and I were able to get a lot farther without Morrow's help. Meanwhile, Morrow climbed up to a weird high spot.

"Hey look! Up ahead!" he yelled.

Once I looked closer, I could see what he was pointing at. Ahead of us, the tangle of walkways started to thin out. Eventually, it narrowed to just one, stretching off into the darkness – the end of this puzzle, and the beginning of whatever came next.

Except, actually… there were <em>two</em> walkways into the darkness. We would have to decide which way to go.

Not that it was hard for <em>me</em> to decide. "The one on the right looks closer to Yali. I'm going that way for sure!"

"Hmm…" said Justicar. "Look closely. Both routes begin with interlocks that will only allow two people across. So it seems we have no choice but to split into groups of two. That means we have a choice to make – not only which way each of us will go, but who will be paired with whom. A difficult choice, as I don't believe that <em>any</em> two of you should be left alone together."

Morrow leaned over a railing, sneering down at her. "Yeeeeeah, and the third one has to be alone with <em>you</em>, so I guess we <em>alllllll</em> have to put up with something we don't like."

Justicar ignored him. "Perhaps I should go with the Alchemist. Then, at least, neither of you would be able to [????? be a bad influence on him]."

"What, and leave me with Morrow? I was already stuck with Morrow for ages!" Not that I wanted to be stuck with Justicar, either. "How about Alchemist goes with <em>me</em> and –" Haha, Morrow and Justicar would both <em>hate</em> being stuck with each other. That would be hilarious, and I was kind of thinking it was what they both deserved. But as soon I thought that, the loopy thing flooded me with that confident feeling again.

"Are you alright?" said Justicar sharply.

I must've been spacing out a bit there. "I'm fine, I was just thinking about how I'm awesome and you should all do what I say."

Justicar and I got caught up in arguing with each other for a minute. But then we were interrupted by a crash. We both whirled around to see where the noise had come from.

Diagonally above us, Alchemist was… surrounded by greenish-brown vines, growing right out of their hands and coiling over the glass all around them. The vines had constricted the spot where one of the wheels was mounted, digging into all the gaps. As we watched, the wheel cracked and toppled off, along with a whole chunk of the railing, spinning into the void.

"What are you doing?!" demanded Justicar.

Alchemist was frozen up and unresponsive, looking down at their hands.

"We have to work together! You may have just made this puzzle unsolvable!"

"No, it's okay!" I said. "I think we can still solve it – like, uh…" I scrambled to find a solution. I hadn't really figured out whether we could solve it, I was just trying to distract Justicar so she wouldn't keep going off on Alchemist. "So, without that wheel, we can't move those two bridges near Alchemist, but we could still, uh… use the central wheel to move those ones over there –"

"– Which would give us access to the rightmost wheel, which, if the pattern continues, should open up the route for the Imminent to reach the left exit," Justicar concluded. "So that is <em>a</em> solution, but it limits our choices –"

That's when I realized. Alchemist and Morrow were both on some of the higher walkways, which were mostly disconnected from the rest. Without the wheel Alchemist had just busted, only the two of them could get to the left exit. And only Justicar and me could get to the right exit. "Are you seriously telling me that Alchemist solved the whole rest of the puzzle while we were arguing?! And then figured out which wheel to break to make sure they'd get to leave with Morrow?! Shit, Alchemist, you're a genius!" I threw them a thumbs-up. I wasn't even mad that they'd stuck me with Justicar, that was just too brilliant. Now the lovebirds would get to be alone together, for the first time… ever, actually, now that I thought about it.

[????? Where in this chapter?

"And why do you always call Alchemist 'he'?"

"He said, 'you can call me whatever you like'. Surely I am not being disrespectful."

I couldn't find a hole in that logic. But it didn't <em>feel</em> respectful.


<bigbreak>

"So…" I said.

"So…" said Justicar.

We were alone together, walking along the long, narrow walkway. Morrow and Alchemist were off in their own puzzles now.

This was sure going to be awkward.

"If you're going to help me find Yali, we don't have to have a problem with each other," I said.

Justicar considered this for a few paces before answering. "I am… not against assisting in your search. The Stern God does ask that I seek the Farseer's guidance, even if it also asks that I not become dependent upon it. However –"

"– however, you're not gonna, because, let me guess –"

"– No, I intend to assist you, to the best of my ability. I simply do not expect that we will be <em>able</em> to find her this way."

"You kidding me? Let me guess, it's because I'd like that, and nothing I like is allowed to happen."

"The law of the Seeking is to challenge us with riddles. What do you think would happen if your Farseer were here? Although she –"

"She's not 'my Farseer', she's my girlfriend!"

"– Although she is wise for her years, she is still young. She has not fully grasped the virtue of restraint – to save her abilities for the opportune moment, not to use the Waiting God's knowledge for every idle pursuit. So if she were with us –"

"You're saying she'd give us the answers too easily."

"Yes. The will of the Seeking is for humanity to experiment, to discover new insights, to learn, to change. If we could progress simply by following answers given to us by others, that would contradict the will of the Seeking, so the Seeking will not allow it. Therefore, if the Seeking has shown her location to us, it must have a different purpose. We <em>may</em> reach her in a physical sense, but even if we do, it will be another layer of the Seeking God's game, not the happy reunion you are imagining."

"Well fuck you too. <em>I</em> say after I do these puzzles, the Seeking will reward me by letting me get – letting me see my fucking girlfriend. Rewards are part of a puzzle too, you know!"

"You can believe what you like."

I hated how she said it like that, like she was automatically right and she was just waiting for me to come around. And a horrible part of me was worried that she was right. Conflicting feelings surged up inside me. One part of me was yelling, <em>Not AGAIN! Not ANOTHER thing where I'm going to lose no matter how hard I try!</em> But then it also got swept away by the cool feeling of the loopy thing, flooding my mind with peace. It was reduced to just an echo, a subtle anxiety in the back of my mind, a worry that everything I was doing was going to be for nothing.

I tried to make it go away. Wasn't the loopy thing supposed to make it go away? But it stayed there stubbornly.

Whatever. I could just put up with it. I gave up and kept walking.

<bigbreak>

Finally, the long walkway came to an end. A huge wall loomed out of the blackness in front of us, extending into shadow both above and below. The walkway just continued right up to the middle of the wall and stopped.

Justicar and I walked up to the wall. While Justicar examined it, I just started cutting it open with my Blood Blades. It turned that there had been a secret door there already, as I discovered when the secret door fell open after I unintentionally cut through its hinges.

With Justicar following me, I stepped over the door into the series of rooms beyond.

The first thing up ahead of us was a big room where the floor was divided into a square grid, with each square about a meter wide. A lot of the squares had glass walls rising up from them, forming smaller rooms and hallways within the big grid. Other squares were missing, leaving pits going down into the floor. Still other squares had doors, buttons, levers, and other devices I didn't recognize.

I pressed my face to one of the glass walls. "I feel like I'm in an aquarium," I said. "Gotta say, the Seeking God's got style."

"Style, perhaps, but it also serves a function. I expect that the walls are made of glass so that we can see the whole puzzle at once. It allows us to examine the puzzle before jumping into anything –"

Well, if she was going to say <em>that</em>, I knew what I had to do. "Alright, time to jump into things!!" I said cheerfully. I danced out onto the floor of the main puzzle area. I was planning to mess with one of the levers, but the glass walls were actually blocking them all off. "Wonder what those are?" I said, waving my arm at a nozzle sticking out of one of the walls.

Just then, the room roared to life. Glass wall slid open. Control panels lit up. And out of the nozzles on the walls, jets of fire spurted out, flames roaring and curling through the air. One of the jets was zooming right towards me. I was too startled to react.

Justicar was quicker. Right away, she leapt in between me and the source of the flames. The flames deflected off of her armor, shooting off at wide angles and dispersing into the air.

"Holy shit, that was badass!" I said.

"Please move," said Justicar tightly, the flames still rolling off of her.

"Uh, right," I said shakily. I moved back out of range. Justicar stepped out of the flames. She concentrated, and the remaining smoke blew away from her armor, leaving it shining as bright as new.

"So is that armor, like, fireproof? Or, wait, did you just manifest the fire away from you? But the god doesn't let us manifest on parts of the puzzle –" Even just standing <em>near</em> the flames felt really hot, and trying to manifest my skin to be cooler didn't help at all. It just made me feel cold <em>and</em> hot.

"The Stern God's will protects me from all forms of physical harm. This armor is only a physical representation of that will." She looked at the puzzle ahead of us. "It appears that there are more corridors blocked off by the flames. So that is the first rule of this puzzle: Only the Justicar can stand safely in the flames. For us both to get past those corridors, I will have to block the flames while you run past."

"Yeah, okay," I said.

"The question is, how will we get past the dead end directly in front of us? That lever must open a new passage, but how –"

Ahead of us, the glass walls funneled us into a short hallway, and at the end of the hallway, there was a lever. But before the lever, there was a giant hole in the floor, cutting completely across the hall.

I sized up the hole. "I could jump that, easy."

"Maybe, but the puzzle might –"

I took off running and jumped clean over the hole. I grabbed the lever and gave it a good heave, smirking. Then I jumped back over the hole as a wall slid open somewhere. "That was easy," I said. "You could probably jump it, too. Even with that armor, it's not –"

"I sincerely doubt that my <em>physical</em> abilities are what matters here. But I will try it, if only to illustrate." Justicar geared up to make a big jump, sprang upwards, and… barely got off the ground. "As I thought. The pit would have no reason to exist if it functions no differently than an empty floor. So that is the second rule of the puzzle: only the Blood Child can cross gaps."

?????


[????? While I was waiting for Justicar to finish her side, I] idly manifested a brick wall to block the fire in front of me. I knew it wasn't going to <em>work</em>, I was just curious to see what would happen. Sure enough, the flames shot right through it. It didn't even burn – it just didn't block the flames at all.

Justicar spotted what I was doing. "I told you," she said patiently, "the Seeking God has set its rules for these puzzles. There will not be a clever trick to bypass them."

"I thought the Seeking God was the <em>god</em> of clever tricks," I muttered.

"And thus, it is within the Seeking God's authority to determine <em>which</em> puzzles may be answered with clever tricks, and which may not."

"Hmph."

<bigbreak>

[????? Where?: Clarify that they have begun a long series of puzzles with the same general format]

"Let me OUT of here!!" I screamed.

I was TRAPPED between these glass walls. I had to get OUT. With a Blood Blade in my hand, I stabbed against the –

"Is something wrong?" came Justicar's voice.

No, I was fine. "Nah," I said, cool confidence surging through me. "I'll have this figured out in no time." I turned back to the puzzle I was working on…

<bigbreak>

"Let me OUT of here!!" I screamed.

"That's the same thing you said earlier, are you –"

"I'm TRAPPED in here, can't you see it?!"

"There is an open door to your left. If you're feeling claustrophobic, you would be able to –"

I looked. It was… open, but that… "That's NOT what I'm TALKING about!! I – I have to – I –" Something had felt really urgent just now, but thinking back, I wasn't sure what it was. It was probably no big deal.

Justicar was hurrying towards me, her voice tight with concern. "If that is not what you're talking about, then explain to me –"

I laughed. "Do you gotta treat everything like it such a big deal? It's fine."

"No, it's not fine. Listen to yourself! <em>Seconds</em> ago, you were saying you were trapped! I can't just let you pretend that didn't happen!"

"But it… really didn't happen. It was, like, a dream or something."

Justicar's face loomed close in front of me. "I <em>heard</em> you. It was no dream. Now tell me what is going on!"

I could feel it again, like hot steam hissing its way around the edges of my mind. It was going to come back. It was going to happen again if I didn't – "Okay, FINE, it's Morrow's loopy thing! It's fucking up! It's SUPPOSED to just – but it's –"

"I can remove it," said Justicar urgently. "The Stern God's will can purge foreign magics from –"

"Do it," I barked.

Justicar's hands suddenly shone with a blinding white light. She pressed them to my forehead, the light stabbing into my eyes. For a few seconds, my mind was suspended with a disconcerting feeling. And then… relief, an angry sort of relief. I felt like I'd just been cut down from being chained to a wall with my underside exposed, and now I was curling up in a spiky ball to protect myself.

"Ugh, remind me to NEVER ask for help from Morrow AGAIN!" I yelled, leaning on a wall and covering my eyes against Justicar's light.

 [????? The worst was over, but I still felt trapped, helpless and overwhelmed. The pounding in my head was too much for me to not snap at Justicar (maybe "no other thoughts would come to my mind")]

?????

"It seems like you have suffered enough."

"Way to rub it in!" I snapped. A bitter resentment was howling inside me. I didn't even <em>want</em> to be snapping at Justicar. But I couldn't think of anything else.

"I wasn't trying to rub it in –"

"Well, GOOD! I don't need any more lectures from you Stern hypocrites!! I've had enough of that back on Earth! Mom and Dad thinking they can control me, teachers acting like they know shit about what's good for me –"

[????? Justicar thought about it, then had an emotional shift and spoke more gently[Maybe Justicar believes that Rinn is going down the wrong path because Rinn's parents haven't been good Stern role models, so Justicar should try to be that]] "Even if they are truly hypocrites – which perhaps they are! – you should not be so quick to discard the wisdom of the Stern simply because of their human failings. In truth, very few who claim to follow the Stern truly uphold its ideals."

"I bet <em>you</em> do, though," I said sarcastically.

"It would be arrogance for me to claim that I am certain of my own virtue –"

"Oh, quit being humble and tell the truth. You think you're hot shit. You're some kind of perfect Stern stick-in-the-mud –"

"I am far from perfect," said Justicar severely.

?????

"I was not so different from you once. I [????? thought the world belonged to me? Multiple examples]."


?????

"parties with underage drinking"

"Sure, I've been to some of those. Only we didn't call them 'parties with underage drinking', we called them 'parties'." I manifested a glass of beer and whooped. I was mostly just messing with her. Normally, getting drunk just made me feel bad. But now… I felt plenty shitty already. I was stuck between Justicar's preaching on one side and the Blood God's grinding impatience on the other. I felt like my head was full of voices yelling at me from all sides. Maybe the alcohol would make them all just <em>shut up</em> for once. I downed my beer angrily, then followed it up with another. As I filled the glass a third time, Justicar put her hand on my wrist and stopped me.

The beer sat uncomfortably in my belly. Stern take it, I should have thought about the fact that I was technically drinking on an empty stomach. And I couldn't stand how Justicar was looking at me. As much as I had gotten a kick out of making her think I was a heavy drinker, I was kind of regretting it now. "I, uh, I don't usually do this," I said awkwardly. "The truth is, I hardly ever actually drink. Look at me – I'm tiny. I go from zero to wasted in, like, ONE beer." The first time I had ever gotten drunk, I had tried to kiss an older girl – and <em>missed</em>, and smashed my face into the table next to her. At least, that's what I heard from the other girls who had to take care of me and drive me home, while I kept hitting on them even though I couldn't sit up straight and had a huge bruise on my face. So a couple weeks later I went back to the next party with the same crowd, and that time I stayed completely sober while I went up to the same girl and started making out with her in front of everyone. And then she had taken me up to her room, and… haha, good times.

"You can use manifesting to stop being drunk," said Justicar.

"Well, I've come this far. Let's, uh, get this party started." I manifested some big speakers and a new copy of my phone, plugged them together, and started blasting some upbeat party music. I picked a song with a strong beat and a sexy voice. As soon as it came on, I wanted to jump up and start dancing, even though it was just me and Justicar here. So I did. I grabbed Justicar's wrist and tried to pull her up with me, but she wouldn't budge.

"Fiiiiine, be that way," I said. I happily started bobbing my head up and down to the beat. Pretty soon, the music started glitching in and out. Right, the speakers I'd manifested were some old ones my dad had from, like, last century. They were flaky as shit. I was about to give them a good kick when I noticed Justicar glancing at them and twitching. Well, if <em>she</em> was annoyed –

Before long, Justicar manifested a different pair of speakers and re-plugged them. The music sounded fine now. Well, worked for me.

I strutted and spun across the floor, my body pumping with the pulse of the music. "Don't tell me you don't know how to enjoy yourself," I laughed in Justicar's direction.

"Is that all you see in a party like this one you are mimicking? A harmless way to enjoy yourself?"

Why did she have to make everything into some sort of serious issue? "Like <em>you'd</em> know anything about it," I snapped.

"On the contrary, I know far too much. When I was your age, I went to parties like this nearly every weekend. I constantly lied to my parents about where I had been and how late I had stayed out."

"You're bullshitting me."

Justicar sighed. "I am a Justicar. I cannot lie. I cannot speak any statement I do not believe to be true. [????? So you can be certain it's true when I say this: I did not respect myself.] I was a heavy drinker. I literally cannot count the times that I drank until I was blacked out or vomiting on the floor. My friends tried to stop me, but I persisted, even knowing that I was making them clean up after me. I ruined my relationships with them, one by one."

I swayed. How could that be the same person as Justicar? I almost wondered if she had lied about not being able to lie. But it didn't <em>feel</em> like a lie. What was I supposed to think? The beer was starting to kick in, it was hard to get my thoughts in order.

Justicar went on. "But even as my life fell apart, I refused to understand that it was myself who had made that happen. I had been a star student, working hard and earning top marks, but I took it for granted. I always wanted more. To fill that void, I reached out in every direction except the one that would actually restore me. I reached for every kind of drug I could get my hands on, I had sex with many different men –"

Well <em>that</em> I knew how to respond to. "Haha, that's where you went wrong. Shoulda had sex with girls instead."

Justicar looked a little frustrated.

"You got a problem with that? With me liking girls?"

Justicar sighed. "I won't rise to your provocation."

"So you <em>do</em> have a problem with it!" I said triumphantly.

"I am not homophobic!" said Justicar angrily. She struggled to find the right words. "It didn't matter <em>who</em> I was having sex with! I –"

"And, liiiiike, you say you 'had sex' with these men when you were totally wasted. Isn't that, like, rape?"

"I put myself in that situation willingly."

"What, like you got wasted specifically to have sex with some dude?"

"No, but it doesn't matter if –"

"Then I don't see how it was consensual," I concluded.

Justicar glared at me. "Are you so eager to avoid taking responsibility for your actions that you must see victimhood everywhere, even when I tell you myself that I was not a victim?"

"What the fuck! Of course I take responsibility for my actions! When I hurt someone else, that's my responsibility. When someone else hurts me, that's their responsibility. It's not that complicated!"

"So, according to you, any time you have sex with a drunk person, that's rape?"

"Uh, generally," I said. I felt like she was trying to pin me down with some sort of clever logic. And I wasn't sure all of the girls <em>I'd</em> been with had been totally sober at the time, so that was a little uncomfortable.

"Then you could just as well say that <em>I</em> raped some of those <em>men</em>."

"Haha, maybe you did! Did you check in with them afterwards or anything? It's not like they'd come up to you the next day and be like, 'By the way, Justicar,' or whatever your real name is, 'you actually traumatized me last night, just so you know'!"

Justicar was smiling – the smile of someone who's being patient with a little kid who's talking nonsense. Stern take it, if I wanted to get through to her, I couldn't just keep saying the first thing that came into my head, even if it wasn't wrong. "So, what, do you think drunk girls are just asking for it?!" I snapped.

"If you would give me a chance to explain the actual principles I follow, you would know I do not believe anything like that. It is always wrong to force yourself on someone else. But no one forced themselves on me. It was my own choice to devalue my body like that. I <em>chose</em> to fill my nights with sexual indiscretions, to distract myself from how I was squandering the true worth of my life. I had no self-respect."

Up to this point, I had mostly just been messing with her. But now… a terrible ache pulled at my heart. This was deadly serious. Her words were a violation, a gaping wound, trying to twist my blood out of its course. Coldly, I stated, "That's your <em>real</em> problem. It's not the sex. It's not the drinking. It's the self-respect. But –" I made a fist in front of my heart "– <em>I've</em> got <em>loads</em> of self-respect. If anyone doesn't treat me right, they can fuck right off. And if they don't fuck right off, I <em>make</em> them. I'm nothing like you."

Justicar raised an eyebrow. "When I was your age, I too believed that I was being assertive and empowered."

Ugh, what was even the point of being serious with her? She was just going to keep saying fucked-up stuff either way. "Yeah, so, maybe I'm in denial. Or maybe you're just wrong. You ever think about that??"

"You can believe what you like," she said.

<bigbreak>

Maybe getting drunk wasn't such a good idea after all. When I wasn't arguing with Justicar, we still had these puzzles to do. In the latest one, there were a lot of long dead-end hallways that each had one button at the end, and we had to remember what each of the buttons did, so we could press them in the right order.

I pressed one of them and watched what happened. "So this one opens the <em>third</em> door and closes the second. Just like, uh, the last one."

Justicar squinted back at me from the other side of the room, peering through several sheets of glass. "No, not like the last one. You only think that because you're in the <em>same</em> hallway as last time."

"No I'm not."

Justicar raised an eyebrow.

"Okay, fine." I stumbled back out of the hall and turned right to go to the next one. But instead, I walked headfirst into a glass wall. "Ow, that hurts."

"If you insist on remaining drunk, why don't you step out of the puzzle and let me solve it by myself? You are not being helpful."

[????? Justicar comes back to Rinn's location, takes her by the shoulders and starts leading her out of the puzzle]

"At least it's only alcohol, not ?????…" she muttered.

????? was an alchemical drug that some people used to get high. It supposedly [????? gave you enjoyable psychological effect]. But I knew a couple of guys who used it a lot, and they kind of… weren't all there, [????? both when they were under its effects and when they weren't]. And their skin was dry and cracked all the time… wait a minute. <em>Justicar</em>'s skin had always looked kind of dry and cracked.

"I don't know why I'm bothering to say this," she went on, "but if you remember only one thing from what I tell you, remember never to touch ?????. No matter how it makes you feel in the moment, it will always –"

"Of course I'm never going to do ?????! That shit fucks you up! Uh, I mean, not that you're fucked up because you did ?????. <em>You're</em> fucked up for completely different reasons." I said, jabbing my finger into the chest plate of her armor. "Ow, that hurts."

"Please stop being drunk," said Justicar wearily.

"Yeah, orrrrrrrr, <em>you</em> could <em>start</em> being drunk," I said. I manifested a wine glass and pressed it to her lips.

Justicar's hand struck the glass violently, shattering it to pieces.

"Woah…" Fuck, I was really drunk now. Belatedly, I pulled my hand away. It was bleeding from the broken glass, but I didn't really feel it. Languidly, I looked up at Justicar, and saw her shaking with anger. "What's the matter?" I mumbled.

"You will not take away the life I have taken back!" she shouted. A bright white light blazed from her in all directions, stabbing at my eyes and feeling like it was shining right through my chest. My drunkenness was stripped away from me, my mind forced to clear again. "Now heal your hand and stop this foolishness!" she ordered.

"Fine!" I made my cuts close. "But seriously, what is your problem? Why'd you have to –"

"You have no idea how much I have had to sacrifice to get away from that life! You treat this as a game – just as I did! You have no idea of the depths to which one can sink!

????? I woke up in the hospital after an overdose. Even then, I refused to believe it was over. Not until my parents walked in. They did not listen to my excuses. They simply <em>told</em> me that I would be going to the Borson School in ????? from then on –"

"Isn't that that place that was in the news for abusing all those kids??"

"You are thinking of Bolsard Academy, in ?????. They are unrelated institutions."

"Er… oh."

"As I was saying, they simply told me of their decision. They did not give me a choice that I could ?????mismake. And for once, I did not try to fight it. On some level, I was aware of how badly my actions were destroying my life. I would never have been able to make that decision myself.

"By the time I was able to leave the hospital, my bags were already packed. They drove me directly to the new school. We did not stop at my home. I was not even allowed a moment with my phone to say goodbye to the few friends who would still talk to me –"

"That's horrible," I breathed.

"It was exactly what I needed. A clean break from the world of the self-destructive habits I had developed."

"But–! You… Argh!"

"At the Borson School, nothing was done for us. We students had to do our own laundry, to clean our own dormitories. Did I accept it at first? No, of course I did not. Selfishly, I rebelled by leaving my clothes dirty and unkempt. I wanted to them to see that I didn't respect them. Only after weeks of being singled out and punished for my disobedience, I learned."

"Learned what, that people are horrible?"

"<em>Discipline!</em> I learned to be <em>responsible</em> for myself –"

"Are you kidding me?! That's the most –"

"Will you let me speak?"

"Not if you're gonna keep saying all this bullshit! You're all like '<em>oh I learned to be responsible</em>' when you didn't even –"

"You will listen to me! You mock responsibility, because you do not want to have to reconsider your own behavior –"

I laughed in her face. "You think I have something against responsible people?! <em>Yali</em> is responsible! Think about it! She even – gods, she even tells me what to do all the time! <em>I literally don't have anything against responsible people who tell me what to do all the time!</em> Only you Stern types! Look, I'm irresponsible and I know it, but I know what being responsible IS. Yali has it. <em>You. Don't.</em>"

Justicar raised an eyebrow. "I must admit, I was not expecting <em>you</em> to accuse <em>me</em> of irresponsibility."

"Argh, do I have to spell it out for you?! You're telling me a story about how some people <em>forced</em> you to do what <em>they</em> told you to, by <em>punishing</em> you until you <em>gave in</em>. And you call that <em>being responsible for yourself?</em> That's not being responsible, that's – argh!" I couldn't even think of the <em>words</em> for how twisted that was. "That's just someone else making all the decisions and you doing all the work. Being responsible is making your OWN DECISIONS!! And now you just do whatever the <em>Stern God</em> wants, too! Out with the old boss, in with the new boss!"

"You speak as if the Stern God's wisdom has no value."

"What about the value of your own heart?! You were alone, you were in pain, you needed a way to feel like you mattered! For YOU! Isn't there any room for that? Don't you believe in anything that's more important than some jerk teachers forcing you to –"

"If they had not forced me, I would never have learned! I would have wallowed in my own filth! Their rules were NECESSARY for me to learn discipline! It allowed me to SEE what I could accomplish if I applied myself! It was at the Borson School that I found the Stern, that I found the discipline I needed to rebuild my life! It was NECESSARY!"

"Didn't it hurt? Didn't you feel humiliated, to be put through –"

"It doesn't matter if –"

"It doesn't <em>matter</em>? ????? How you feel <em>matters</em>! Even when you're in pain and doing everything wrong! <em>Especially</em> when you're in pain and doing everything wrong!"

"I was a selfish, petulant CHILD!! ????? [????? Very aggressive statement towards Rinn] ????? –" Justicar stopped herself and looked away. She took a deep breath. "I apologize for losing my composure. You have a way of getting under my skin. I did not mean to argue with you."

"Nice apology," I said sarcastically.

Justicar glared at me. Then she took another deep breath. "I apologize for venting my emotions in my previous apology. It was not fair to you."

"You kidding me? We were just <em>getting</em> somewhere! And now you want to apologize and make it disappear? Morrow was right, you <em>do</em> shove your feelings down a dumpster!"

I was trying to provoke her into arguing some more, but it didn't get through at all. She had somehow completely calmed herself down. "You can believe what you like," she said.

"And I'm sick of you saying 'you can believe what you like'! That's just what you say when you don't want to think about what I'm saying!"

"You can believe what you like."

<bigbreak>

????? Another puzzle

Even now that I was sober, she was still way better at solving the puzzles than I was. I wasn't <em>bad</em> at it, but Justicar could just look at something and instantly be like, <em>logically, this is what we have to do</em>. It kind of felt like there was no point in me trying to follow along. I mostly just ended up going along with what she said.

?????

[????? "I cannot force you to believe me. But [the strictures of the rules are what saved me; short summary of life during + after the school]"]

?????

"So," I said, summing things up, "what I'm hearing is, first, your life sucked. And then you 'found the Stern'. And now, your life still sucks. When was the last time you enjoyed yourself?"

"It is not important whether I enjoy myself. What is important is whether I stay true to my principles."



?????




?????

[????? Rinn assumes that Justicar would approve of anything done in the name of the Stern, and Justicar reveals that she was a police officer]

"You assume, simply because a thing was done in the name of the Stern, that I would approve of it. But as I said, not all who claim to follow the Stern truly uphold its principles. Even the highest ranks of the Stern Temple are full of – have their share of hypocrites ?????

"After I graduated from the Borson School, I was given a second chance at life – a privilege that not everyone receives. I wanted to make the most of what I had been given. I wanted to give back to society. I began training to enter the Stern police force."

?????

"You're a cop?! I thought you said you weren't a cop!!"

"I said that I <em>am</em> not a police officer," she said with a tight smile. "I was dismissed from the force. The official records would tell you that it was for obstructing the duties of my fellow officers. But as I prefer to see it, I was dismissed from the police force <em>for enforcing the law</em>."

"Okay, there's gotta be quite a story behind <em>that</em> one."

????? "I was a star student once again. [????? authority figures] praised my hard work and sense of duty. Hypocrites, all of them.

proud to serve in an organization dedicated to upholding the will of the Stern. How foolish I was, assuming that the humans who worked for the Stern Temple would respect the will of the Stern as I did.	I was asked to overlook bias and petty corruption. [????? Bias in favor of rich people] simply because they could create trouble for us. I asked them: Did we not follow the Stern? Did we not have a duty to enforce the law impartially, regardless of any risk it might bring upon us? ????? I was barely tolerated. My superiors [????? assigned me unwanted duties]. But the Stern teaches that even when we are hated, we must be true to our convictions. Every duty they assigned me, I carried out to the fullness of my ability.

"But I was not oblivious to what happened around me. Most of what we did was lawful, but that is not enough. We cannot call ourselves a Stern Temple if we tolerate corruption within our midst. And I could not help but notice how conversations died when I entered the room. Things were being hidden from me. For a time, I ignored it to focus on my own duties. After all, we cannot control the choices of others, only our own. But when I began to notice a pattern of unexplained <em>bruises</em> appearing on our arrestees, I could ignore it no longer.

"So I began to investigate. I coordinated with the few people I thought I could trust. ????? I chose unpredictable days to arrive early for my shifts.

"It was in this way that I came to witness one of my 'fellow officers' beating a handcuffed arrestee.

"I arrested him immediately, of course."

I snickered. "Haha, that's gotta sting. Imagine being a cop and getting arrested in your own police station."

"I would prefer to say: Imagine committing battery in plain view of a police officer and getting arrested. If you commit a crime, you are not a police officer, you are a criminal."

"Ice cold," I said, grinning.

[????? include: the poeple who were on my side but didn't stick up for me:] "The Stern Temple did not see things the same way. I was placed on leave before the day was out, and dismissed from the force less than two weeks later, with no opportunity to defend myself. I challenged my dismissal through what should have been an impartial process, but they shut me out in every way they could. Even my old mentors, at the temple where I had trained, refused to speak to me. I finally cornered the High Priest of the Stern Temple himself, [????? is it "of the Stern Temple" or "of the Stern God"?] but before I could even speak, he told me he was 'not interested in routine personnel issues'. I could easily see that it was a prepared response. The entire hierarchy of the Temple was complicit."

"But now," she smiled grimly. "it seems that the god itself has vindicated me."

?????

I had an idea. I waited for Justicar to [????? do something with the puzzle]…

"Hey, Havi!"

"Yes?" said Justicar. Then she whirled around angrily. "How did you know my name?!"

I grinned. "This was a few years ago, right? You had a whole post about it! You were all like 'The so-called Stern Temple are a DEN OF HYPOCRITES!' and 'They will remember the name of Havi ????? until –'"

"Please don't remind me."

"I remember because [????? my friend] Dehel kept reposting it from a meme page. He always reposted it with just a whole bunch of thinking face emoji. Haha, I think it [?????the meme page] was actually called <em>The Blood God's Dank Meme Stash –</em> man, that was so three years ago." I sensed that Justicar was trying not to listen. "Wait a minute, why don't you want to be reminded about this?! You were kickass!"

"I gave in to my selfish resentment. It was not the appropriate way for me to air my grievances with the Stern Temple."

"Ugh, you're so Stern that even when you hate the Stern you have to be more Stern than they are??"

"<em>Everyone</em> has a duty to be more Stern than they are."

"Uggggghhhhhhh."

[????? where to fit this?: how can the law be pure when it's also made by humans? like, "if the Stern Temple is generally corrupt, how can you still support the idea of it"]

[????? Finishing up the puzzle]
?????
<bigbreak>

We were in the elevator again [????? set this up], taking a brief rest as we got close to the end of a long chain of puzzles. How many days had we been at this now?

Justicar was sitting straight-backed as usual, staring straight ahead, while I slouched against the wall of the elevator. I was seriously sick of being stuck with her. She never just talked about shit like my real friends did. I felt isolated, craving any sort of connection. But all I had was her. And the more I learned about her, the less I liked. She had been a <em>cop</em>! An actual <em>cop</em>! Sure, it was pretty badass that she had tried to take down another cop, but the way she <em>talked</em> about it was just <em>infuriating</em>.

And even though I had a copy of my phone again, I was long since bored of all the games I had on it. Messing with Justicar was the only entertainment I still had.

"So…" I said, trying to sound sly but probably just sounding like an asshole, "when you were a cop, how many people did you put in prison?" I couldn't resist asking her that. I just <em>knew</em> she was going to come up with some reason not to answer.

Sure enough, she completely avoided it. "Police officers do not 'put people in prison'. It is judges and juries who determine sentencing."

This was gonna be good. I quickly tried to plan out all the ways I could keep messing with her. But then, another thought shot through me, a much more serious thought. "<em>Now</em> who's not taking responsibility for their actions?!" I demanded. "You arrest people, then they go to prison. And somehow that doesn't count??"

"We each do our own part in the system, and only our own part. If a conviction is unjust, that cannot be laid at the feet of officers who were only carrying out their duties."

"Are you kidding me!! [?????That's like,] If I throw someone in a pit full of vipers, do you think I get to say, 'oh, it's not my fault, I'M not the one who put those vipers in that pit'!?! Or do you want to lay the blame where it fucking belongs?"

"But where would that lead? If officers cannot make arrests because of the <em>possibility</em> of an unjust conviction, how will the order of the city be preserved? I believe you may not have thought this through."

"Or maybe I just don't care about order as much as I care about people's lives! I don't care what kind of excuses you have! If you're the one who did something, it's your fault!"

"Very well." Justicar opened her arms. "If you want to hold me individually responsible for every violent act ever performed under the authority of the Stern Temple, perhaps <em>I</em> should hold <em>you</em> responsible for the damage caused by <em>your</em> ideology."

"And what's that?"

"The collapse of society. Mass starvation. Gangs slaughtering each other in the streets."

"Oh yeah? When did that happen?"

"The only reason it has not happened is the fact that <em>the Stern are still in control</em>. What would happen if we put a child like yourself in charge of society? You claim to value people's lives above order, but that is a contradiction, because order is the way that people's lives are preserved. Even at the most basic level, if laws against shoplifting cannot be enforced, then shoplifting will run rampant. If people can steal things as easily as buy them, how will stores make money? If stores cannot make money, who will be incentivized to import goods into the city? Food?"

"I mean, if I'm in charge, I can just tell someone to import food into the city."

"Because you have seen how a tower is shaped, you imagine that you could tear one down and build another from the ruins without any tools.

?????

"You're good at making yourself sound smart, but you're not," I said aggressively. "It's all just a bunch of fancy words to try and justify what you Stern do to people. Why don't you just be honest and beat us up like the others?!"

"That is not –"

"I grew up down the street from that kid!" I shouted over her. I had only barely figured out where I was going with this, but a righteous rage was building in my chest. "[????? Name]! He went to prison for stealing a $50 pair of headphones! He was sixteen, just like I am now! No corrupt cop beat him up! It was legal! Everything they did to him was legal! They gave him twelve months in jail! A year of his life, GONE! For a $50 pair of headphones!!" My face was hot, tears springing to my eyes. What was I feeling? I had never really cared about ?????Name before – in fact, I'd always thought he was kind of a dumbass. But it was like I had suddenly woken up to how <em>wrong</em> it was. All the pain, the humiliation of being trapped by a system that never cared for him. It had opened the lid to a bottomless well of pain and rage. I couldn't stop ripping into Justicar with my words, straining my throat just to spit out the barest shadow of what it would take to set things right. "He got out last year, and he just hasn't been the same! He doesn't want to talk about it, he just clams up! You think maybe he was traumatized there, just a little?!"

"If he was abused in prison, that is <em>not</em> the will of the Stern! You cannot blame –"

"Prison IS abuse, Justicar! You think you're innocent?! A year of life! That's what your Temple took away! Was that a worthy sacrifice for your order?! Your precious <em>principles</em> destroy people's LIVES, Justicar! Don't you dare call me the evil one!"

Justicar sighed.

"Just the manifesto I would expect from a Blood Child," she said. "Full of passion and fury, lacking in consideration and foresight."

Rage surged up in me. I wanted to punch the smug indifference right off her face. But my heart was weighed down with a heavy thought: <em>this is not my true enemy</em>. That was <em>definitely</em> the Blood God again, not me. Why was it thinking <em>that</em>? Whatever. I settled with just yelling again. "Did you listen to a word I just said?!" I demanded.

"The law is not naive," said Justicar, oblivious to the struggle inside me. "Judges can, and do, let common thieves go without prison time, when the circumstances allow. If your friend was given twelve months, he may have been a repeat offender, or –"

"Like that changes anything! If he stole a few more times! He could have stolen a $50 pair of headphones <em>every day for the enire year</em> and it still wouldn't be worth as much as what you sacrificed!"

"And still your solution is to erase the law and justice system that we have. How very like the Blood God."

"Ya know, I wasn't a fan of the Blood God before, but the more you talk, the more I think maybe it's got some good ideas."

"You will not find your enlightenment down that road," said Justicar. She continued, speaking like she was reciting a practiced statement. "The lower gods act without thinking. The upper gods tarry in thought, rarely taking meaningful action. Only the Stern, which stands in the middle, has the balance necessary to administrate a society. That is why the Stern Temple officially controls three fifths of the city, and why –"

"Wait a minute. Only three fifths?"

"The Waiting Temple has formal authority over the first layer. The Seeking Temple, the second. And the Stern Temple is based in the third layer, but also has authority over the fourth and the fifth –"

"– the fifth layer, which <em>should</em> go with the Blood Temple," I finished instinctively.

"Which <em>did</em> belong to the Blood Temple before its collapse and dissolution." Something about that description felt completely unfair. But I couldn't figure out how to express it, so I just glared at her while she continued. "But the Blood Temple was disorganized and corrupt. As I was saying, only the Stern is capable of the organization the city needs. That is why the Stern Temple was given the lower layers, and why the Stern God maintains equal influence in the Ravelling, despite what it lacks in raw power."

"Lacks in…? I thought all the gods were equally powerful!"

"No. For one, the Broken God's power vastly exceeds that of all the others." That <em>did</em> sound sort of familiar. "Among the others, the Waiting God has the most, but rarely uses it. Then comes the Blood God – or <em>would</em> come, had it not [????? been deprived of rejuvenation; but phrase it in a way that sounds approving]. The Stern God is second to last, and last is the Seeking, which spends its power frivolously." Justicar waved an arm, indicating the elaborate puzzles all around us.

"How come you and Yali get to know all kinds of stuff about the gods? The Blood God never told <em>me</em> anything cool."

"This knowledge does not come from the Stern God. At least, not directly. Once I found the Stern… I simply learned to pay attention in Divinity class."

"Fuck you too."

We were interrupted by the elevator coming to a stop.

<bigbreak>

The great doors slid open, revealing the final puzzle.

The room in front of us much smaller than the others. I checked the map. "This has got to be the last puzzle before we get to Yali!!" I said excitedly, trying to just be happy about that and forget my raw conflict with Justicar. I could practically <em>feel</em> her being skeptical behind me. Well, screw her anyway.

The puzzle in front of us looked really simple. Justicar and I were forced into separate corridors – there was one that you could only enter if you jumped, and one that you could only enter if you walked through fire. On my side, there was a closed door, then a room full of perpetually roaring flames. On Justicar's side, there was also a closed door, but in front of it, there was a button. There was also a place on my side where the corridor branched off, but it just led to a dead end with another flamethrower in it. Why?

"Guess you've got to stand on that button," I said. "I'm literally looking at a closed door here. I can't do anything. "

"Understood." Justicar stood on the button. The door on <em>my</em> side slid open, and the flames disappeared from the room beyond. Continuing the routine, she stepped off again to see whether it would stay that way, but it didn't – the doorway closed again and the flames came back. Then she stepped back on, switching them again.

"Ooooo-kay…" I said. "I guess I'm going to walk into the fire room now. You better not step off that button."

"Understood," said Justicar tiredly.

Tentatively, I poked my feet into the room. Now that the flames were gone, I could see what was inside. But it wasn't much. On the far wall, the only exit was another closed door. In the middle of the floor, there was another button. "I guess I'm going to stand on this button," I said. "That's literally the only thing we can do. There's no way the Seeking God we give us an <em>easy</em> puzzle at this point, is there…?"

Not thinking of anything else to do, I stood on the button. The door on Justicar's side slid open.

<bigbreak>

"This is completely useless!" I yelled in frustration. We had been talking about the puzzle for ages, but it still seemed impossible. The <em>only</em> way to open the door on Justicar's side was for me to stand on the button in the fire room. But if Justicar wanted to walk <em>through</em> that door, she'd have to step <em>off</em> the button that was turning the fire off. And then I'd be locked in the room and barbecued. That was probably bad, although it was seeming more tempting by the minute.

"There must be something we've missed…" muttered Justicar.

"Like what, a secret switch that lets us skip the puzzle?"

"No. These puzzles are about applying the established rules in new ways the solver may not think of. The god would not change the rules this late in the sequence."

"Wait, why not? I mean, I was being sarcastic, but maybe we actually <em>should</em> look for –"

"Though it may seem random, the Seeking God does everything with a purpose. If the puzzles have built up to this point, it must have a lesson for us that is more complex than a simple deception. It would waste the potential of the situation."

"Fine, but if you haven't figured out what the lesson <em>is</em>, I'm going to look for a secret switch, just in case."

"Suit yourself."

I searched all up and down the walls. There wasn't much to search. I felt like Morrow trying to search the gray room from earlier. Eventually, I just started pacing around and staring irritably at the various parts of the puzzle.

There wasn't much to stare at, either.

"What I <em>really</em> don't get is this extra flamethrower over here on my side," I said. "It doesn't <em>do</em> anything. It's literally just down a dead end, not blocking off anything!"

"In that case, it is irrelevant to the puzzle. It may be intended as a distraction."

"It's out of place, though. There haven't been distractions like this before… It's gotta mean something!"

I walked up close to the spurting flames. I tried to look at them from every angle, hoping I'd notice something new. But it didn't look different than any of the others. Unless there was something different about the nozzle itself – it was kind of hard to see from where I was standing. To get to it, I'd have to walk through the flames, and this one was always on – none of the buttons turned it off. So…

"Wait. I have an idea! Something this flamethrower could be meant for!" A thrill shot through me. I stepped towards the flames.
 
"What are you doing?" said Justicar.

I brought my hand close to the fire. It felt burning hot, as if getting any closer would burn my hand to cinders. But I pressed on, bringing it closer and closer. The fire stayed hot. But it <em>didn't get hotter</em>. Before long, my fingertips were brushing the edge of the flame itself, and I hadn't been burned yet. I turned my hand around, and my fingers looked fine. There wasn't a mark on them – they looked the same color as the rest of my skin.

When I really concentrated, really paid attention to how they felt… they weren't even <em>warm</em>.

"Stop that!" said Justicar. She probably still thought I was playing with <em>real</em> fire.

I smirked. With a flourish, I jumped into the center of the flames. Then I turned around and leaned my back against the spurting source of the fire, stretching and yawning as if I was relaxing in a hot spring or something. It actually hurt a lot, but it was worth it to watch Justicar panic. "I <em>get</em> it now!" I said. "This one was here to <em>teach</em> me! To teach me that none of the flamethrowers ever mattered! I could have walked through them all along!"

And it wasn't even just that I would have to <em>walk</em> into the flames. In this puzzle, <em>I</em> didn't have to do anything except stand in the middle of the fire room helplessly, while <em>Justicar</em> had to turn it on.

Justicar must have realized the same thing, because she immediately tensed up. "That cannot be what we have to do! There must be something else!"

"Nope! This is totally it!"

"But the Seeking God wouldn't – well, the Seeking God <em>is</em> a god of tricks and illusions… so if they are only an illusion… if you will not actually be harmed…"

If that made it easier for her… "Actually, it still hurts a lot. I was just pretending earlier."

"Then there must be another way! Even if the flames do not actually injure you, that only means that the Seeking God did not want to inflict injuries simply because a person broke the rules. They still represent an impassable barrier! The puzzle will have a more proper solution –"

I grinned savagely. "No, it won't! You said it yourself! If there was a way to get out of this, it would <em>waste that potential of the situation</em> –"

Justicar glared at me.

"I take back everything bad I ever said about the Seeking God, this is great! You're going to have to admit that you were wrong! You were wrong from the very beginning!"

Justicar sighed. "If it comes to that, do you think I will have difficulty admitting that I was wrong? No one can be correct every time. The Stern asks that we remain humble and admit to our mistakes when they do occur."

"Oh, you're no fun."

<bigbreak>

We didn't find any other solution, of course. Justicar took forever to convince herself, but she finally gave in.

Now, she was standing on her button, and I on the button in the fire room, about to do what we had to.

"You are sure you're ready for this?"

"'course I am."

Justicar closed her eyes. With a strained voice, she recited, "<em>Let me strike when I must strike, even if it costs my life; but let me yield when I must yield, even if it costs my pride.</em>"

"Oh, get on with it," I said. I knew I was safe, but just standing here waiting to be torched was giving me the jitters.

Justicar sprinted towards the open door on her side. I didn't see much after that, because there were flames all around me. Searing pain struck at the entire surface of my skin. It actually felt kind of kickass, standing proudly in the middle of the inferno, tensing my whole body to resist the pain.

Moments later, the flames fizzled away. The door out of the fire room was open in front of me.

"Blood Child, are you all right?" said Justicar anxiously.

I couldn't resist. I hunched over, pretending I was still in horrible pain.

"Tell me you're all right! You can come out of that room now! I've opened the exit! Come on out! Please! Rinn!!"

I straightened up, grinning. "You actually called me by my name!!"

Justicar relaxed immediately. "I should have known…" she muttered. "Just come over here."

I hurried out of the fire room. After the doors we had just gone through, the two sides of the puzzle joined together again, and there was only the final exit door left. It was another huge doorway, leading into a cylindrical tunnel, its walls shiny and black and perfectly smooth. The tunnel looked nothing like the series of puzzles we'd just done.

"Looks like we just finished the last puzzle! High-five!"

To my slight surprise, Justicar actually high-fived me back. "Yes, this is an accomplishment we can be proud of."

I headed for the exit, expecting Justicar to follow me.

"But there is still something I wonder," said Justicar dourly. "These puzzles were constructed for both of us. If you are correct, and the solution we used was the one the Seeking God intended, then I have to admit that it <em>did</em> have… some form of lesson for me. But then, surely, somewhere in this, there must also be a lesson for <em>you</em>?"

I smirked. "Nah, it just means I was right all along! I'm the one who thought, uh…" Actually, when I thought about it, I hadn't really disagreed with Justicar about anything. I had just sort of… gone along with… "Oh. My. GODS!! I can't believe it, I seriously can't believe it! I've gone this entire way, this ENTIRE way, acting like I hate the rules, like I think they're all bullshit! But when you told me what you thought the rules were – the <em>very first time you told me</em> – I BELIEVED you! I could have checked any time I wanted! I could have stuck my hand in the fire whenever I wanted to, and then I could have skipped past all the puzzles! But the Seeking God <em>knew</em> I wouldn't do it! It knew I would just –" the words came reluctantly to my lips "– <em>trust</em> you."

"An interesting thought, but how was that <em>my</em> rule? Anyone could have assumed th–"

I paced back and forth, not even listening to her. I COULDN'T get distracted! Now that I had this insight, I had to keep going, seeing everything it meant before I lost my train of thought! "I've been looking at this all wrong from the beginning! I've been doing all this stupid shit just to annoy you – I've been treating you like you're just a <em>fact of life</em> that I'm fed up with! Every part of the Stern – I break the rules, I make fun of the teachers, but at the end of the day I go home and do my homework like it's just how things are! Would you believe that when I heard about ?????, the first thing I thought was 'what an idiot' because he got caught?! How!? How could I have been so – <em>victim-blaming</em>?! How could I have <em>believed in the Stern?!??</em>"

"That is not what 'belief in the Stern' m–"

"I will never believe in the Stern again! By my blood, not a single thing you do is just a <em>fact of life</em>. You're a –"

<em>– a monster who should never have been constructed.</em>

<em>– a poor, vulnerable human clinging to a lie.</em>

<em>– not my true enemy.</em>

"Oh? What am I?"

I clutched my head, trying to calm my warring thoughts. I should have had something brilliant to say that would totally shut down all of Justicar's bad ?????arguments. But now the feeling of insight was gone, leaving my mind in a jumble. Which part was me, and which part was the Blood God? Could they <em>all</em> be the Blood God? For fuck's sake, why wouldn't it just leave me OUT of its family squabbles? And now it was squabbling with <em>itself</em>, too?!

"I don't know. This is stupid. Never mind."

"No, you clearly had something to say. If you start something, you should finish it."

I stared back at her. I almost wanted to say something defensive, but if there was one thing I had just learned, it was that I really <em>didn't</em> have to listen to her. "Let's just go find Yali," I said tiredly.


The exit doorway was right in front of us, leading to a tunnel into the blackness.

[????? possibly end the chapter here, move the next section into chapter 10]

?????

[????? Somewhere in here: the tunnels aren't puzzle area, they're like maintenance tunnels and/or the interior of the god's body]

The tunnel was so smooth and dark that it was hard to see where the walls were. ????? And it was actually perfectly cylindrical. Justicar and I ended up walking single-file, because otherwise it was too hard to balance on the curved floor.

I made the map appear in my hand. As we walked, I kept checking it obsessively, almost every other step. The Watchful Eye – <em>Yali</em> – was so close to us. The tunnel curved in an irregular, wavy pattern back and forth, as we rounded each bend, we got closer to Yali. And closer. And closer.

And… the same distance? And farther away?

I turned around.

"Where are you going?" said Justicar.

"The tunnel's bending back! We're getting farther away from Yali this way!"

"You see? I told you the Seeking God would never allow us to reach the Farseer this way."

I kept looking at the map in my hand. Going too far in one direction took me further away from her. Going too far in the other direction also took me further away from her. I found the closest point, and glared at the wall there. On the map, the little Burning Heart and the little Watchful Eye were so close they were almost touching.

"She's right on the other side of this wall!!" I yelled. "I will <em>not</em> be denied <em>again!</em>" I snatched a Blood Blade out of thin air and swung it against the wall.

The blade glanced off the wall's infinite smoothness. But I wasn't done. With my next heartbeat, another blade pulsed into my other hand. I whirled around, slashing both my blades against the wall, but every time they slid away.

"You can't ignore me forever!!" I yelled at the wall.

"Tell me when you are done trying to intimidate a god," said Justicar tiredly.

There was much more I could do than just smacking it with a couple of sticks. With each heartbeat, I allowed more power to pulse into me. The Blood Blades merged into my arms – there was no longer just a hand gripping a handle, but a single, long, bladed arm, glowing red with heat. I whipped them against the wall, not trying to cut so much as to splatter and bludgeon. With each swing, extra droplets of blood sprayed in every direction around me, and pooled, sizzling, like an acid trying to eat away at the walls and floor.

A short distance away, Justicar manifested a glass barrier to keep herself clean. My blood burned through it like it was tissue paper.

But the wall was still utterly smooth, impervious to everything I was throwing at it. I couldn't just keep beating on at aimlessly. I needed <em>leverage</em>. What could I push off of? If I wanted to hit the wall harder, I'd have to brace myself against something in the other direction, and the only thing in the other direction was –

The opposite wall of the tunnel.

I called the power into myself again. I turned my body into one long, lean, mass of muscle. My legs stretched out, growing into powerful hindclaws. More blades sprouted from my back, forming jagged ridges like shredded wings. With every new blade that grew out of me, I braced myself more and more against the opposite wall.

And then, I made my weapon. I focused a Blood Blade down to a single point, a vividly sharp, hard, exacting spike. I gripped a long handle in both hands, aiming it straight-on into the wall. I heaved my full strength into it with no worry that it could slip left or right.

My spike bit into the wall.

It felt like a distant scream. A wave of energy passed over me, an aching splash of color at the edges of my vision. Near me, I saw Justicar raise a hand in front of her face, as if protecting herself from an unseen force.

"What are you doing?!" Justicar yelled.

I grinned savagely. If the Seeking God was in pain, that meant I was winning. I heaved again, flexing and straining with every muscle along the length of my body. The screaming exploded into my ears, like a jackhammer and a gong and a crying baby rolled into one. Reality flickered around me, becoming a mass of discordant color and stench.

"That's enough!" shouted Justicar. "Stop this immediately!" She stepped forward, her sword bouncing at her side as she summoned a shard of white light in her hands. I could <em>feel</em> her light as a blank spot in my thunderhead of rage. If that light touched me, it would scrub away my strength, erase everything I was fighting for.

Before she could get to me, I heaved a final time.

The world shattered.

<bigbreak>

I stumbled and landed on my hands and knees.

What had just happened? I looked around. It looked like a pretty normal place, as much as any part of the Seeking God's world was normal. It was just a foggy landscape of sand and smooth rocks. The only weird thing was a bunch of ladders sticking vertically out of the ground.

Where was I?! I summoned the map in my hand, a horrible feeling sinking into my chest. On a gut level, I already knew I was fucked. But I had to know. Staring into the map, I zeroed in on the Watchful Eye, right where it was before. And then I looked for where I was, for the Burning Heart. I saw the map zoom away from the courthouse, sweeping past every puzzle Justicar and I had done, sweeping past the fountain room itself. And it didn't stop there. I saw caves and castles and labyrinths sweep by, impossible landscapes and mazes of flowing ice. By the time it reached the Burning Heart, it had gone further than the entire distance I'd traveled in this world. I was the farthest away from Yali that I could <em>possibly</em> be.

"I'LL KILL YOU!!!" I roared. I snatched up a rock in my hand, and, imagining that it was the Seeking God, I smashed it to pieces. Then I sprouted a Blood Blade from my heel and stomped on the broken rock, slicing it into smaller and smaller slivers. "YOU THINK YOU CAN JERK ME AROUND, LIKE THIS IS ALL A BIG GAME?! I AM BLEEDING ON THE FLOOR, AND YOU STILL USE MY HEART AS A PLAYTHING?! I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A GOD! I WILL TEAR YOU TO PIECES!" I whirled around, my arm whipping into a long blade with a bleeding edge, my eyes trying to zero in on whatever looked most like the heart of the god.

But when my eyes began to make sense of what I saw, it was only more ladders and rocks and fog. And behind one of the ladders, scarcely two meters away from me, the frozen, terrified face of the Alchemist.
