Up ahead of us was a big room where the floor was divided into a square grid, with each square about a meter wide. A lot of the squares had glass walls rising up from them, forming smaller rooms and hallways within the big gid. Other squares were missing, leaving pits going down into the floor. Still other squares had doors, buttons, levers, and other devices I didn't recognize.

?????

"The walls are made of glass so that we can see the whole puzzle at once."

?????

"Holy shit, that was badass!" I said.

"Please move," said Justicar tightly, the flames still rolling off of her.

"Uh, right," I said shakily. I moved back. Justicar stepped out of the flames. She concentrated, and the remaining smoke blew away from her armor, leaving it shining as bright as new.

"So are you, like, immune to fire? Or, wait, did you just manifest it away from you? But the god doesn't let us manifest on parts of the puzzle –"

"The Stern God's will protects me from all forms of physical harm. This armor is only a physical representation of that will." She looked at the puzzle ahead of us. "It appears that there are more corridors blocked off by the flames. So that is the first rule of this puzzle: Only the Justicar can stand safely in the flames. For us both to get past those corridors, I will have to block the flames while you run past."

"Yeah, okay," I said.

"The question is, how will we get past the dead end directly in front of us?"

Sure enough,

?????

"I was not so different from you once. I [????? thought the world belonged to me? Multiple examples]."


?????

"parties with underage drinking"

"Sure, I've been to some of those. Only we didn't call them 'parties with underage drinking', we called them 'parties'."
?????

"I had sex with many different men."

"Haha, that's where you went wrong. Shoulda had sex with girls instead."

Justicar looked a little frustrated.

"You got a problem with that? With me liking girls?"

Justicar sighed. "I won't rise to your provocation."

"So you <em>do</em> have a problem with it!" I said triumphantly.

"I am not homophobic!" said Justicar angrily. She struggled to find the right words. "It didn't matter <em>who</em> I was having sex with! I –"

"Also, you say you 'had sex' with these men when you were [????? very drunk]. Isn't that… rape?"

"I put myself in that situation willingly."

"What, like you got [????? very drunk] specifically to have sex with some dude?"

"It doesn't matter if –"

"Then I don't see how it was consensual," I ?????.

Justicar glared at me. "Are you so eager to avoid taking responsibility for your actions that you must see victimhood everywhere, even when I tell you myself that I was not a victim?"

"What the fuck! Of course I take responsibility for my actions! When I hurt someone else, that's my responsibility. When someone else hurts me, that's their responsibility. It's not that complicated!"



[????? Descriptions like "I devalued my body", perhaps unintentionally explicit about avoiding something.] I had no self-respect."

Up to this point, I had mostly just been messing with her. But [????? this was serious. I got all charged up.] "That's your <em>real</em> problem," I said coldly. "But I've got loads of self-respect.
 
?????


"The lower gods act without thinking. The upper gods tarry in thought without taking meaningful action. Only the Stern, which stands in the middle, has the [????? balance necessary to run a society]. That is why the Stern Temple officially controls three fifths of the city, and why the Stern God ?????, despite what it lacks in raw power."

"Lacks in raw power? I thought all the gods were equally powerful."

"No. For one, the Broken God's power vastly exceeds that of all the others. Among the others, the Waiting God has the most, but rarely uses it. Then comes the Blood God – or <em>would</em> come, had it not [????? been deprived of rejuvenation; but phrase it in a way that sounds approving]. The Stern God is second to last, and last is the Seeking, which spends its power frivolously." Justicar waved an arm, indicating the elaborate puzzles all around us.

"How come you and Yali get to know all kinds of stuff about the gods? The Blood God never told <em>me</em> anything cool."

"This knowledge does not come from the Stern God directly. I simply paid attention in divinity class, [????? after I changed]."

"Fuck you."
