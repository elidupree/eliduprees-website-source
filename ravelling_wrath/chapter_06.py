<h2>Chapter 6: The Starry Void</h2>

I quickly sat up and looked around.

There was a sky full of stars in every direction, but this time, they looked like real stars instead of spooky dream stars. The next thing I saw was a desk with a computer screen, for some reason. Other than that, there was just the sky, the floor, and – there she was!

"Yali! You're here!!"

I jumped to my feet, then immediately slipped on the smooth floor. I almost fell on my face, but I caught myself with my arms and sprang back up again. Concentrating, I hurried to Yali's side without slipping again.

"Yali! Can you hear me?"

She was lying face-up on the floor, just like I had been, but she hadn't reacted at all. I dropped to my knees and grabbed her shoulders, my heart pounding.

"Uhhhhhhh," she moaned, staring into space.

It was a lot like when she'd been exhausted after she used the Seeing. Could it be another weird magic thing? "I'm here, it's me, Rinn. Can you –"

Yali lurched upwards and her eyes zeroed in on me. "Your feelings!" she choked out. "Are you having any anger?"

"Thank the gods, you're alright!" I hugged her quickly. "This is great! We're both here and –" my mind caught up with what she'd said "– and I'm not angry at all, in fact, I feel great!"
