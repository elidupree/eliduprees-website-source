I quickly sat up and looked around.

There was a sky full of stars in every direction, but this time, they looked like real stars instead of spooky dream stars. The next thing I saw was a desk with a computer screen, for some reason. Other than that, there was just the sky, the floor, and – there she was!

"Yali! You're here!!"

I jumped to my feet, then immediately slipped. The floor was unbelievably smooth. I almost fell on my face, but I caught myself with my arms and sprang back up again. Concentrating, I hurried to Yali's side without slipping again.

"Yali! Can you hear me?"

She was lying face-up on the floor, just like I had been, but she hadn't reacted at all. I dropped to my knees and grabbed her shoulders, my heart pounding.

"Uhhhhhhh," she moaned, staring into space.

It was a lot like when she'd been exhausted after she used the Seeing. Could it be another weird magic thing? "I'm here, it's me, Rinn. Can you –"

Yali lurched upwards and her eyes zeroed in on me. "Your feelings!" she choked out. "Are you having any anger?"

"Thank the gods, you're alright!" I hugged her quickly. "This is great! We're both here and –" my brain caught up with what she'd actually said "– and I'm not angry at all, in fact, I feel great!"

"That's a relief." Yali sank back to the floor.

"You okay there? Anything I can get you? Haha I guess not but I can cuddle with you while you –"

Yali gently pushed me away. "Why don't you take a look around? I'll be up in a minute."

"But we should look together –"

"Remember, I know this place already."

"Okay, but tell me if you need anything!" I stood up again, careful not to slip this time, and reluctantly tore my eyes away from Yali to look at the other stuff. Well, first, I pulled off the hoodie Yali gave me and chucked it on the ground. That was much better. I'd forgotten how much that kind of loose clothing just made me feel like a weird blob. Now in just my shirt, I raised my head and took a satisfying breath. This was how it should be, just my body right up close to the world.

With that done, I took a proper look at everything. We were on the middle of a smooth, translucent white platform, a circle about 20 meters wide. There was really almost nothing on it. The only things here were me, Yali, a desk with a computer, and a fancy telescope mounted to the floor next to it. Other than that, there were no walls, no landscape, nothing – only the starry sky in literally every direction.

I couldn't even see anything else over the edges of the platform. I carefully knelt down at the edge and looked over… and saw <em>more</em> stars stretching out endlessly below us.

"Woah…" I said, stepping back until I was next to Yali. "Are we just floating in space? What happens if we fall off?!"

"You wouldn't fall very far," said Yali. "The gravity goes right back towards the star."

"What star?"

Yali patted the platform under us.

"We're standing on top of a <em>star</em>?!"

"<em>Every</em> star you see up there is a disk just like this one. That's what we're going to be navigating across."

"Navigating the stars? Do we get, like, a rocket ship?"

Yali smiled. "No, it's actually the stars themselves that move. You see… you see…" Yali slowly climbed to her feet and brushed herself off. As soon as she was done, I couldn't resist putting my arms around her again. She idly hugged me back, still concentrating on something else. "I can explain in a minute. But first… Before we get started… I want to check your feelings again. You really aren't having any anger?"

"Yeah, like I told you, silly." I leaned into her warmth and planted a series of kisses on her cheek. "If anything, I love you even more than I did before. So much for that prediction, haha."

"Well, it's possible… We don't really know how the previous Blood Children felt <em>right at first</em>. And Aihael hid his feelings for a long time, so…" She stopped and thought. "Maybe it just hasn't changed your feelings about <em>me</em>… How do you feel about <em>the Farseer</em>?"

"What? But you <em>are</em> the Farseer."

"It's about, it's about, how you think of me. Here…" Yali pulled away from me. I reluctantly let her untangle herself from my arms and step back. Then she solemnly raised one hand and began reciting an invocation. It wasn't one I could repeat from memory, but I recognized it. "<em>By our ancestors who laid down the stones beneath our feet, by our visions for the generations yet to come, by the Waiting God, –</em>"

I snickered. "Don't pretend like you're some kind of holy person," I said. It came out sounding a bit meaner than I'd intended it. Yali looked flustered. "Uh, I didn't mean that in a bad way."

"Don't feel bad about it. It might be the Blood God influencing you."

"Really? But it's not like I felt, like, angry, or anything. It's just silly that you were acting that way when you're obviously, like, not."

"Hmm." Yali squinted. "Well, keep paying attention. Tell me if you feel anything you don't expect."

"Yeah, yeah." I sidled up and wrapped myself around her again. "Now tell me about how we're going to move the stars around."

"Okay. Okay. For that, first, let's look at… over there…"

<bigbreak>

"Why a computer?" I said. "I thought you said there wouldn't be any computers unless we brought them."

Yali frowned. "I did. There's never been a computer here before, it's always been… a shelf with a lot of books…"

"Haha, maybe the Waiting God scanned all the books and now it's a 'digital collection'!"

"No, no… Remember, this isn't a regular place, the gods re-create their worlds every year. So it's not about what's <em>physically</em> there, it's about…" Suddenly, she burst out laughing.

"What's so funny?" I said. Yali kept laughing. "Hey! Don't leave me out of the loop here!"

She barely contained herself. "Oh I get it now… It was never a bookshelf, it was 'a vast collection of ancient knowledge'! And it's constructed based on our assumptions, so maybe people USED to think that meant a bunch of books, but the place <em>we'd</em> look for ancient knowledge is –"

"– on the Internet," we finished together. I grinned. "Hey, does that mean we'll have Internet here?"

It didn't. When I started messing around on the computer, I didn't recognize any of the programs on it. Most of them had to do with some sort of Codex. There was one called Codex, one called CodexViewer, one called CodexSearch, one called KnowledgeBase, and a whole bunch more stuff like that. I tried starting a few of them, and none of them even did anything.

"This is stupid," I said.

"This is the Waiting God," said Yali.

"Well then, the Waiting God is stupid." I said. "What do you mean, though?"

"The Waiting God values patience, foresight, and planning. So everything in this world is built to require those things. To navigate through the stars, we have to examine them using the telescope. To learn how to use the telescope, we have to study the Codex. To study the Codex, we have to, to… to figure out how the programs work, I guess. But if you jump into anything without thinking about what you're doing, you won't get anywhere."

When she said "jump into anything", it made me think of physical jumping, and how I'd almost fallen over the first time I'd jumped up after I got here. Because the floor was slippery… "Oh for fuck's sake, even the <em>floor</em> needs planning?!" I glared and stomped on the floor, but it didn't react. Not sure what I was expecting.

?????

"– whereas in a 3-α cluster, the channels are similar, but the chirality is reversed. Thus, within a 3-α, sign echoes propagate in a clockwise direction (when viewed from the direction of the root – although here, "the root" may refer to the root of an ancestor cluster, if the 3-α is poly?????ic) rather than counterclockwise. Take caution: because of this unusual chirality, the presence of a 3-α greatly increases the chance of echo propagation that exceeds the usual bounds, meaning that observed signs may reflect the signs of a star multiple clusters away. Fortunately, this is limited to the case of –"

"This doesn't say <em>shit</em> about how to use a telescope," I said.

"Aren't you just reading a random part in the middle?" said Yali from over my shoulder.

"Well I STARTED at the beginning! But that was just pages and pages of boring stuff!" For some reason, all of the Codex programs had started working about half an hour after we showed up. But somehow, that wasn't making things any easier. "And why didn't CodexSearch show us anything good for 'telescope'? It's a freakin' <em>search!!</em>"

"Maybe there's another name for the telescope. We should think about –"

"If you're so smart, why don't <em>you</em> figure it out?" I shoved myself away from the desk and stood up, letting Yali sit down in my place. ????? "Hey, how about you use your Seeing? Look in the future and tell us how we figure it all out."

"I, I, I think I'm not allowed," said Yali.

"What?"

"The Seeing comes from the god, right? And the god wants us all to plan out our journey the regular way. So it won't show me futures that let us skip past the process."

"Of COURSE it wasn't going to be that easy. What a condescending –" I glared at the screen. I couldn't find the right words to express how messed up that was that the Waiting God was making us go along with this. Well, whatever.

[????? Maybe Rinn enjoying watching Yali work, without actually paying attention to the screen]

?????

Apparently the "star" we were standing on was already moving at a zillion kilometers per second, we just couldn't tell because, first, we were standing on it, and second, the rest of the stars were even more zillions of kilometers away. But they were all moving in some sort of ridiculously complex pattern. And every so often, two stars would meet up with each other while they were moving at the same speed, and then you could walk from one of them to the other. Even though we were supposedly "navigating through the stars", we didn't actually control how the stars were moving at all. All we could do was choose which one to stand on when they met up with each other. So once Yali figured out what star we should be moving to next, all we'd have to do was wait.

<em>Wait.</em> I was already getting sick of that word.

"I thought this was going to be a big adventure!" I complained. "Are you seriously telling me we're just going to be stuck on a rock together for weeks?! I mean, not that I mind being stuck on a rock with <em>you</em> –" I kissed her halfheartedly "– but, like, I thought we were going to be fighting monsters and stuff!"

"There aren't any monsters, that's just in the movies. There <em>will</em> be some adventure, just –"

"– just not until we get to the other layers. Yeah, yeah, I remember what you told me." The Seeking God's layer was next, and it sounded <em>way</em> cooler than this one. But meanwhile… "There's just nothing to <em>do</em> here!"

"It's okay. I'm sure we can find things to do. We haven't even…" Yali trailed off and started quietly concentrating. I almost interrupted her, but I wasn't <em>that</em> impatient. I just sighed and looked around, as if I was going to spot anything new here. But there was just the same old stuff. And the same old stars.

When I looked back, Yali was holding a clay pot.

"Where'd that come from?" I said.

Yali gave an embarrassed smile. "I thought I'd try manifesting. The first thing I thought of was a potted plant I used to have in my room. But I forgot you can't manifest anything that has its own soul."

"Plants have souls?" I said. Then I smacked myself in the forehead. "Well duh, of course I knew that. It's just not something you think about every day, you know? Wait, never mind that! Manifesting! How do I do this, do I just, like, <em>want</em> something into existence –" I waved a hand, imagining that I was pulling something out of thin air.

Yali flinched.

"You okay there?" I said, moving towards her. She frantically backed away from me, a terrified expression on her face. What was she looking at? I followed her gaze, and that's when I noticed what I was holding in my hand.

It was a blade of the length of my forearm, black and glistening. Instinctively, it felt like an extra part of my arm. Like a claw ready to reach out and tear the world apart.

"Whaaa –" I threw the blade away from me. It vanished before it hit the ground. "What the fuck was that?"

"That," Yali panted, "that killed me a lot of times." She adjusted her shirt. "I'm okay now. I shouldn't have been surprised. Every Blood Child could summon the Blood Blades, it was probably just the easiest thing for you to manifest. Here, make another one. Go ahead, it's okay."

Cautiously, I repeated the gesture I'd made earlier. Sure enough, another black blade sprang into existence in my hand. This time, I got a better look at it. When I looked closely at it, it was actually dark red rather than black. And it had an almost liquid quality about it. There was no clear line where the blade ended and the handle began, and it was perfectly molded to the shape of my hand. As if it had been made for me.

Its sharp edge, though, looked ragged and vicious. Most of the blade showed a clear reflection of the stars, but near the edge, it was dull and scratched-looking.

Curiously, I touched the edge with my other hand. It flowed around my fingers without cutting them, giving them a warm, wet sensation. "Check it out," I said.

Yali examined the blade gingerly, without touching it. "Amazing. I've never gotten a clear look at one of these before. It's said that they're an extension of your own blood. Figuratively, I guess. You should even be able to feel through it, as if it was part of your own arm."

"Yeah, it kind of felt like that. Let me just try –" Experimentally, I reached out with the side of the blade and tapped the table with it. Sure enough, I could feel the table like I was touching it. "Wow, I thought it would feel really weird, but it doesn't feel weird at all. That's so weird."

I tried a lot more things with the Blood Blades before moving on. I could manifest more than one of them at a time, and I could make them bigger or smaller, or change their shape a little, just by wanting to. And they wouldn't cut anything unless I wanted to cut it – but if I <em>did</em> want to cut something, <em>oooooh boy</em> were they good at it. I shredded off a corner of the table in one swing. It wasn't a clean cut, but it sure did have a satisfying thud and ripping feeling. So I did it again.

"Rinn…" said Yali hesitantly after I made a few more cuts. "Maybe don't destroy the <em>entire</em> table? You're getting close to the computer stuff."

"Oh. Uh, right, of course. I mean, I was about to stop anyway," I lied. "Let me manifest some normal stuff now. Catch!" I made a ball appear in my hand and threw it to her. ?????

"I can make anything I want. Nothing costs money <em>here</em>!" I made a sienkah fruit in each hand and chomped into them greedily, letting the juices drip down my chin. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Yali smiling at that. So I made a show of it, making an absolute feast and eating as messily as I could. ????? From how she was looking at me, I could tell she was totally into it. So I swaggered up to her and, with bits of food still smeared all over my face, kissed her right on the mouth.

That didn't go over quite as well. She sort of stiffened up and pulled back. Then she concentrated for a moment, and the smears disappeared from her.

"Spoilsport," I said affectionately.

"I, I, I –"

"Nah, it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got carried away. Look, I'm backing off now."

"It's not that, I, I…" she trailed off. It looked like she was deep in thought, so I gave her some space and went back to trying things out on my own.

A few minutes later, I noticed her muttering to herself. "We, we…" I looked up and saw that Yali was holding a fruit close to her mouth. "We can actually be as messy as we want, just for fun, and we don't have to worry about cleaning up after." She stared at the fruit she was holding. Then she shook her head a little, lowered her hand, and the fruit disappeared.

"Hey, uh, if you want to do it, you should do it," I said.

She shook her head again. "It's, it's easier this way."

Stern take it all. <em>Are you going to hold back this entire time?</em> I thought. I didn't say it out loud, though, because that would just make her more stressed.

[cut this - repeated above "I thought this was supposed to be a big adventure!" I complained. "Not just sitting on a rock all day, waiting for something to happen. Uh, not that I mind being stuck on a rock with <em>you</em> –" I kissed her on the cheek. But I was kind of forcing it.]

<bigbreak>

Traveling through the Otherworld was NOT as interesting as it was cracked up to be.

Sure, there was the looming threat of our possible deaths. But it didn't really seem like that was going to happen <em>here</em>, on a tiny platform in the middle of literal empty space. Being <em>here</em> was just <em>boring</em>.

[????? Experimenting with manifesting ?????; blood blades are the easiest thing to manifest]

The worst part was, I wasn't even having much fun with Yali. When she was awake, she spent half her time studying the Codex or looking in the telescope. When she wasn't doing <em>that</em>, she spent half her time Seeing into the future. "It's to make sure we stay alive," she'd said. Well, of course I wanted us to stay alive, but couldn't see just keep us alive faster? Stern take it all. Not only that, but whenever I <em>wanted</em> to know something from the future, she didn't know it, because the Seeing had a whole bunch of limitations.

For one thing, it only showed <em>possible</em> futures, so if she looked too far ahead, almost anything could happen. For another, she couldn't see <em>anything</em> after we went to the next layer. Apparently, at each layer crossing, the gods wove more of their threads in to us – and when the other gods did something big like that, the Waiting God wouldn't be able to predict it. Even some of the other Ravellers' powers were enough to disrupt the Seeing and make parts of the future unreadable. And finally, it was hard to find specific futures even if you wanted to. Yali said she'd seen glimpses of the other Ravellers, and even bits of conversation, but those were only things they <em>might</em> say in <em>some</em> situation, not a whole picture. So the Seeing <em>sounded</em> great, but it was a whole lot of bother to get anything good out of it.

And then there was our together time. Yali had manifested an enormous, reclining couch that was just the right shape for us to curl up together and cuddle for hours. Which was nice and all. It seemed to make <em>Yali</em> happy, at least. She always had that sleepy, peaceful expression on her face, only occasionally moving to shift her weight, or stroke my hair, or nuzzle into my cheek. And it's not that I <em>didn't</em> enjoy it. I'd never gotten to spend so much time with her before, and letting my body soak up her warmth, it made me feel floaty and wonderful. But I just didn't like doing it for as <em>long</em> as she did. Before long, I always wanted to be <em>doing</em> something.

Or even if I wasn't doing something, at least we could be <em>talking</em> about something. But whenever I tried to talk to her while we were cuddling, she'd just go "mm-hmm" to everything. She wasn't really listening.

?????

[Experimenting with going over the edge]

????


[Rinn says one or 2 rude/annoyed things about Yali being unresponsive]

"This is how much I normally talk," said Yali abruptly.

I looked back over at her. "What?" I said.

?????

"What are you talking about? What about all those times when – like, we've spent entire evenings talking together!"

"????? I'm sorry, I, I didn't think of, of, I spent so much time planning for the bigger stuff, I just, this kind of idle time, I didn't think of it. And I've, I've, been trying, to make this, to, to give you what you want, too, but, I, I've been trying, I…" she trailed off.

I waited impatiently for her to go on, but she didn't. Frustrated, I gave up and turned away. But when I thought of going back to ?????, something [????? bitter] reared up inside me. How could I just <em>let her</em> leave me hanging like this?!

I whirled back on her. The words caught in my throat – I knew it was wrong, but it just felt so <em>right</em>. I spat, "This is your idea of giving me what I want?!"

Yali's face fell with dismay.

I stomped towards her. "You think you can string me along, acting all nice, like everything's great [????? change those phrases to be more blood God inspired], and then when I'm <em>stuck on a rock with you</em>, you clam up on me?!" I swung my arm for emphasis, but it went farther than I intended, and my hand smacked into the clay pot Yali had made earlier. It wobbled and almost fell over.

"Controlling Game," said Yali tensely.

I was momentarily stopped in my tracks. "What? You think this is the Blood God?! This is <em>me!</em> Don't you get it?! Maybe <em>you're</em> fine being all alone on the time, you don't understand how much it <em>hurts</em> when you just <em>shut me out</em> like this!" Yali didn't respond. I shoved my face right in front of hers. "What, you don't have anything to say? Come on, say something!"

That's when I noticed the look on her face. It was subtle, but I'd seen a lot of her face lately, and the difference was unmistakable. Her eyes were slightly widened, frozen in a stare. The muscles around her mouth were tight. 

Something knotted up in my stomach, like maybe I'd gone too far. But I couldn't just leave it like this! I took half a step back and said, "Hey, uh, you've gotta work with me here, alright? Just, uh –" She still had that frozen look. I stepped back further. "Come on, you know I'm not going to hurt you! You can stop looking like that!" She didn't react. I held up my hands placatingly. "Look, I'm going to leave now, okay? Then you won't have to talk to me or anything. So that's good, right?!"

I wasn't even sure if I was being bitter or just saying whatever came into my head. Anyway, I clearly wasn't getting any sort of response from her. With nothing else to do, I dashed off side of the platform and fell around to the underside.

It wasn't much for privacy, but at least we couldn't see each other directly. My head was pounding. I just wanted to get away from everything. If only there was somewhere around here to go for a long run, to blow off all this excess energy. But all I had was this tiny platform, with nowhere to really move around at all.

I needed <em>something</em>. With my stomach in a knot, I stuck my hands out in front of me and manifested one of the treadmills from the gym back at home. I climbed on and switched it on, but nothing happened. Because there was no power. Fucking of <em>course</em>. I slammed my fist down on the controls, snapping off a bit of the plastic. Why did this have to happen to me? Even this fucking MACHINE wouldn't do what I wanted.

Raging, I started "walking" on the treadmill anyway. Since it wasn't on, it was more like just shoving the belt with my legs over and over. But at least it was a workout. Shove. Shove. Shove.

After a few dozen angry steps, my muscles started warming up. Another few dozen, my head started to clear. The angry, bitter thoughts stopped pounding so hard. I had room to think again.

Yali…

What had I yelled at her for? ?????

?????

Could it be that we were actually incompatible? ????? It was like having my guts ripped out. I had no one else. Not Layo. Not Mom and Dad. Not ?????. There'd be the other Ravellers, but they were so far away and I had no idea what they'd be like. Yali was the ONLY person I had. And if I kept fucking up like this, I was going to lose her.

That look on her face, when I'd blown past her Controlling Game… what was that look? She'd been tensed up, frozen in place, like she couldn't handle what was happening. Almost like… fear?

A sick feeling drilled into the pit of my stomach. That couldn't be right, could it? She wasn't <em>afraid</em>, it was just a reaction, like when I'd first summoned a Blood Blade. She knew I wouldn't actually hurt her, right? I was just blowing off steam! And besides, she had looked way more scared when the Blood Blade thing happened! And then she'd gotten back under control right away, because she knew it was just me and I wouldn't hurt her! Obviously! So obviously, THIS time, maybe I did some stuff I shouldn't have, and she got scared, but then I started backing off, and then she was… still acting scared… because… that meant…

I had made her afraid of me.

I felt like I was going to throw up. My hands tingled and my legs shook. I kept shoving my feet into the treadmill harder and harder, as if walking hard enough would change what happened. How could I have DONE that?? Why couldn't I have just LISTENED to her??!! So many feelings were crushing me from all sides. Loneliness. Guilt. Fear. Nausea. Helplessness. Self-pity. I doubled over, slumping my full weight against the handle of the treadmill. An uncontrollable sob tore out of me. I was barely holding myself up. My tears splattered unrestrained on the floor.

I don't know how long I stayed like that. Wave after wave of [????? feeling] [????? verbed me]. Finally, I was just so weak I didn't even want to stay standing anymore. I lifted a hand, intending to un-manifest the treadmill and make something soft instead, like a couch. I didn't stop and think that without the treadmill, I was hovering [????? distance] up in the air. As soon as I moved, my stomach dropped out. My arms and legs clattered into a heap on the hard floor.

I couldn't even bring myself to get up again. I just made a heavy blanket over me and curled up inside it. Parts of me were still lying directly on the floor, but if I wanted to get more comfortable, I'd have had to lift myself up at all, and that was just too much to even think about. I lay that way for a long time, not quite resting. It was half comfort, half pain.

I should go apologize to her, I said to myself. I could just run back to the other side and tell her I knew I fucked up and beg for her forgiveness. What was I waiting for?! I should have done that as soon as I realized! But… what would that even mean to her? Would that make her feel better? Or would I just be pushing more talking on her when she wasn't ready for it?

My muscles made the decision for me. I wasn't going anywhere, not anytime soon.

There was no way to tell time in this world, and I [????? didn't check my phone]. After an eternity, I found myself drifting off, flickering in and out of the [????? noun that passed for sleep here].

A voice shocked me out of [????? that], [????? warbling] from under the floor.

"Rinn. I can talk now."

[????? Oh my gods, Yali was going to be judging me so hard]

?????

I let myself collapse onto my hands and knees in front of her. "I'm sorry, I'm so so so sorry, I should never have done that, I –"

Yali covered my mouth. "Rinn. Rinn." Her voice was low and soothing. "It's okay. [????? Stuff calculated to reassure Rinn]"

I didn't even have words to say back. I [????? gratefully [but more spilling-your-guts-everywhere–ish]] wrapped my arms around her legs.

?????

[?????"It's very strange," she said. "I don't think it's you, I think it's the Blood God. [????? I've been noticing this change in your pattern of behavior]. But… It the blood God shouldn't be about entitlement, contempt – anger is different than obsessive dislike" will]

[???? "Don't pretend like you're some kind of holy person" wasn't like you"]

"Really? I mean, when have I ever respected anything religious?"

"You can't think of any other way you might have reacted? Like, if I was actually more religious than I am?"

"I mean, if you were <em>actually</em> religious, I guess that would be, like, one of the things that makes you <em>you</em>? I mean, like, I wouldn't get it, but I'd have to, you know…"

"That's what I thought… Whenever it's about <em>me</em>, you find a way to interpret it in a positive way. But that time, you didn't." She paused. "Not that I mind if you hate the Waiting Temple. I'm only pointing it out."

"Wait a minute. So you don't want me to hate on the Stern Temple around you. But the Waiting Temple is fair game?"

"Yeah, why not? They're different temples." That was a bit of an unusual thing to say. It was <em>technically</em> true, but to most people, the Stern and the Waiting were kind of just two different branches of <em>the people in charge of the city</em>. The Stern were more of the everyday throw-you-in-jail types, and the Waiting were more of a faraway authority handing down decrees about long-term projects for the city, but they were pretty much on the same side. And Stern preachers were always like <em>you must respect the Waiting</em>, too. When I was a kid, my parents had made me go to temple every week, it was so annoying. And that meant a Stern temple. I'd never actually <em>been</em> inside a Waiting temple – at least, not that I could remember. There weren't many around where I lived, and they were even more boring and old-fashioned.

After a pause, Yali squinted. "Actually, no. Please don't make fun of the Waiting Temple either."

"What?" I said.

"The point is, <em>I've</em> noticed a difference. You haven't been giving me the benefit of the doubt as much, at least when it's about the Waiting God or its world. So I think we might be seeing the first part of the Blood God's influence. But…" She frowned. "This isn't how the Blood God is supposed to operate. It's supposed to be about anger, like, direct confrontation. Not about contempt, or… feeling like you're entitled to my help… I mean, this change has to be coming from the Blood God, but I don't understand."

Why did it have to be coming from the Blood God? Maybe because… because if it <em>wasn't</em> coming from the Blood God, that would mean it was coming from <em>me</em>. And Yali couldn't believe that it was coming from me. I felt like my heart was being pulled in two different directions. Yali really trusted me so much that she couldn't believe I would have said all those things of my own accord. But what if she was wrong?

?????

The freaky thing was that I didn't feel any different. When Yali had told me about the Blood God stuff, I had expected that it would be a constant struggle to hold on to what I really wanted. Like there would be an invader in my mind that I had to fight against. But instead, it was constant… normal stuff. Just me thinking stuff that I would normally think. Reacting the way I would normally react. Until the moment when I realized I had gone over the edge and hurt her.

could make out a figure standing there.

As the star drifted closer, I could make out more details of the figure. Tall and proud, she was dressed in a gleaming armor from the neck down. She stood rigidly in place, silently watching us as the stars came together.

So this was the Justicar.

The edges of the two stars touched smoothly together, without even a bump. There was a tense silence. Yali and the Justicar had each stood close to the edge of their star to meet the other, so now, they were scarcely a meter apart. The Justicar's eyes flicked back and forth between Yali and me. I was itching to break the tension, but Yali had told me to let her do the talking. And Yali was waiting for the Justicar to make the first move.

Finally, the Justicar broke the silence.

"The stars spoke of a Blood Child and a Farseer here," she said. "But which of you is which?"
