<h2>Chapter 6: The Starry Void</h2>

I quickly sat up and looked around.

There was a sky full of stars in every direction, but this time, they looked like real stars instead of spooky dream stars. The next thing I saw was a desk with a computer screen, for some reason. Other than that, there was just the sky, the floor, and – there she was!

"Yali! You're here!!"

I jumped to my feet, then immediately slipped. The floor was unbelievably smooth. I almost fell on my face, but I caught myself with my arms and sprang back up again. Concentrating, I hurried to Yali's side without slipping again.

"Yali! Can you hear me?"

She was lying face-up on the floor, just like I had been, but she hadn't reacted at all. I dropped to my knees and grabbed her shoulders, my heart pounding.

"Uhhhhhhh," she moaned, staring into space.

It was a lot like when she'd been exhausted after she used the Seeing. Could it be another weird magic thing? "I'm here, it's me, Rinn. Can you –"

Yali lurched upwards and her eyes zeroed in on me. "Your feelings!" she choked out. "Are you having any anger?"

"Thank the gods, you're alright!" I hugged her quickly. "This is great! We're both here and –" my brain caught up with what she'd actually said "– and I'm not angry at all, in fact, I feel great!"

?????

[????? Took a look around]. Well, first, I pulled off the hoodie Yali gave me and chucked it on the ground. That was much better. Without that loose clothing, I could feel the air around me again. Then I took a proper look at everything.

We were standing [????? but Yali is sitting] on the middle of a smooth, translucent white platform, a circle about 20 meters wide. There was really almost nothing on it. The only features were a desk with a computer, and a fancy telescope mounted to the floor next to it. Other than that, there were no walls, no landscape, nothing – only the starry sky in literally every direction. I couldn't even see anything else beyond the edges of the platform. I carefully knelt down at the edge and looked over… and saw <em>more</em> stars stretching out endlessly below us.

"Woah…" I said. "What happens if we fall off?!"

"You wouldn't fall very far," said Yali. "The gravity goes right back towards the star."

"What star?"

Yali patted the platform under us.

"We're standing on top of a <em>star</em>?!"

"<em>Every</em> star you see up there is a disk just like this one. That's what we're going to be navigating across."

?????

Yali was holding a clay pot. "What's that?" I said.

Yali gave an embarrassed smile. "I thought I'd try manifesting. The first thing I thought of was a potted plant I used to have in my room. But I forgot you can't manifest anything that has its own soul."

"Plants have souls?" I said. Then I smacked myself in the forehead. "Well duh, of course I knew that. It's just not something you think about every day, you know? Wait, never mind that! Manifesting! How do I do this, do I just, like, <em>want</em> something into existence –" I waved a hand, imagining that I was pulling something out of thin air.

Yali flinched.

"You okay there?" I said, moving towards her. She frantically backed away from me, a terrified expression on her face. What was she looking at? I followed her gaze, and that's when I noticed what I was holding in my hand.

It was a blade of the length of my forearm, black and glistening, its ????? ?????.

"Whaaa –" I threw the blade away from me. It vanished before it hit the ground. "What the fuck was that?"

"That," Yali panted, "that killed me a lot of times." She adjusted her shirt. "I'm okay now. I shouldn't have been surprised. Every Blood Child could summon the Blood Blades, it was probably just the easiest thing for you to manifest. Here, make another one. Go ahead, it's okay."

Cautiously, I repeated the gesture I'd made earlier. Sure enough, another black blade sprang into existence in my hand. ?????

Yali examined it gingerly. "?????. It's said that they're an extension of your own blood. Figuratively, I guess. You should even be able to feel through it, as if it was part of your own arm."

Experimentally, I reached out with the blade and tapped the table with the end of it. Sure enough, I could feel the table like I was touching it. "Wow, I thought it would feel really weird, but it doesn't feel weird at all. That's so weird."

?????

"Let me manifest some normal stuff now. Catch!" I made a baseball appear in my hand and threw it to her. ?????

"I can make anything I want. Nothing costs money <em>here</em>!" I made a sienkah fruit in each hand and chomped into them greedily, letting the juices drip down my chin. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Yali smiling at that. So I made a show of it, making an absolute feast and eating as messily as I could. ????? From how she was looking at me, I could tell she was totally into it. So [????? Then with the food stains all over my lips,] I swaggered up to her and kissed her on the mouth.

That didn't go over quite as well. She sort of stiffened up and pulled back. Then she concentrated for a moment, and the stains disappeared from her.

"Spoilsport," I said affectionately.

"I, I, I –"

"Nah, it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got carried away."

????

"[????? Hang on.] Before we get started, I want to check your feelings again. You really aren't having any anger?"

"Yeah, like I told you. So much for that prediction, haha." [????? maybe fit some physical affection here?]

"Well, it's possible… We don't really know how the previous Blood Children felt <em>right at first</em>. And Aihael hid his feelings for a long time, so…" She stopped and thought. "Maybe it just hasn't changed your feelings about <em>me</em>… How do you feel about <em>the Farseer</em>?"

"What? But you <em>are</em> the Farseer."

"It's about, it's about, how you think of me. Here…" Yali raised one hand, and began reciting an invocation. It wasn't one I could repeat from memory, but I recognized it. "<em>By our ancestors who laid down the stones beneath our feet, by our visions for the generations yet to come, by the Waiting God, –</em>"

I snickered. "Don't pretend like you're some kind of holy person," I said. It came out sounding a bit meaner than I'd intended it. Yali looked flustered. "Uh, I didn't mean that in a bad way."

"Don't worry about it. It may be the Blood God influencing you."

"Really? But it's not like I felt, like, angry, or anything. It's just silly that you were acting that way when you're obviously, like, not."

"Hmm." Yali squinted. "Well, keep paying attention to it. Tell me if you feel anything you don't expect."

"Yeah, yeah."

????

[Rinn says one or 2 rude/annoyed things about Yali being unresponsive]

????

"This is how much I normally talk," said Yali abruptly.

I looked back over at her. "What?" I said.

?????

"What are you talking about? What about all those times when – like, we've spent entire evenings talking together!"

"????? I'm sorry, I, I didn't think of this, I spent so much time planning for the bigger stuff, I just, this kind of idle time, I didn't think of it. And I've, I've, been trying, to make this, to, to give you what you want, too, but, I, I've been trying, I…" she trailed off.

I waited impatiently for her to go on, but she didn't. Frustrated, I gave up and turned away. But when I thought of going back to ?????, something [????? bitter] reared up inside me. How could I just <em>let her</em> leave me hanging like this?!

I whirled back on her. The words caught in my throat – I knew it was wrong, but it just felt so <em>right</em>. I spat, "This is your idea of giving me what I want?!"

Yali's face [verb] with dismay.

I stomped towards her. "You think you can string me along, acting all nice, like everything's great [????? change those phrases to be more blood God inspired], and then when I'm <em>stuck on a rock with you</em>, you clam up on me?!" I swung my arm for emphasis, but [????? I clumsied] and my hand smacked into [????? object belonging to Yali that was established earlier]. It wobbled and almost fell over.

"Controlling Game," said Yali tensely.

I was momentarily stopped in my tracks. "What? You think this is the Blood God?! This is <em>me!</em> Don't you get it?! Maybe <em>you're</em> fine being all alone on the time, you don't understand how much it <em>hurts</em> when you just <em>shut me out</em> like this! ????? Come on, say something!"

[????? Closer look at Yali's face]


?????

[????? Didn't even have any space to move around in] I stuck my hands out in front of me and manifested one of the treadmills from the gym back at home. I climbed on and switched it on, but nothing happened because there was no power. Fucking of <em>course</em>. I slammed my fist down on the controls, snapping off a bit of the plastic. Why did this have to happen to me? Even this fucking MACHINE wouldn't do what I wanted.

[Angrily ?????], I started "walking" on the treadmill anyway. Since it wasn't on, it was more like just shoving the belt with my legs over and over. But at least it was a workout. Shove. Shove. Shove.

After a few dozen angry steps, my muscles started warming up. Another few dozen, my head started to clear. I could finally [????? think about it properly].

Yali…

What had I yelled at her for? ?????

?????

Could it be that we were actually incompatible? ????? It was like having my guts ripped out. I had no one else. Not Layo. Not Mom and Dad. Not ?????. There'd be the other Ravellers, but they were so far away and I had no idea what they'd be like. Yali was the ONLY person I had. And if I kept fucking up like this, I was going to lose her.

That look on her face, when I'd blown past her Calming Game… what was that look?

?????

almost like… fear?

A sick feeling started [tangling up ?????] in the pit of my stomach. That couldn't be right, could it? She wasn't <em>afraid</em>, it was just a reaction, like when I'd first summoned a Blood Blade. She knew I wouldn't actually hurt her, right? I was just… [????? Rinn remembers details of the reaction]

I had made her afraid of me.

I felt like I was going to throw up. My hands tingled and my legs shook. I kept walking more and more aggressively. How could I have DONE that?? Why couldn't I have just LISTENED to her??!! So many feelings were crushing me from all sides. Loneliness. Guilt. Fear. Nausea. Helplessness. Self-pity. I doubled over, slumping my full weight against the handle of the treadmill. An uncontrollable sob tore out of me. I was barely holding myself up. My tears splattered unrestrained on the floor.

I don't know how long I stayed like that. Wave after wave of [????? feeling] [????? verbed me]. Finally, I was just so weak I didn't even want to stay standing anymore. I lifted a hand, intending to un-manifest the treadmill and make something soft instead, like a couch. I didn't stop and think that without the treadmill, I was hovering [????? distance] up in the air. As soon as I moved, my stomach dropped out. My arms and legs clattered into a heap on the hard floor.

I couldn't even bring myself to get up again. I just made a heavy blanket over me and curled up inside it. Parts of me were still lying directly on the floor, but if I wanted to get more comfortable, I'd have had to lift myself up at all, and that was just too much to even think about. I lay that way for a long time, not quite resting. It was half comfort, half pain.

I should go apologize to her, I said to myself. I could just [????? go] back to the other side and tell her [????? I knew I'd done wrong] and beg for her forgiveness. What was I waiting for?! I should have done that as soon as I realized! But… what would that even mean to her? Would it be [????? something nice]? Or would it just be more [????? excessive talking that she didn't want to hear]?

My muscles made the decision for me. I wasn't going anywhere, not anytime soon.

There was no way to tell time in this world, and I [????? didn't check my phone]. After an eternity, I found myself drifting off, flickering in and out of the [????? noun that passed for sleep here].

A voice shocked me out of [????? that], [????? warbling] from under the floor.

"Rinn. I can talk now."

[????? Oh my gods, Yali was going to be judging me so hard]

?????

I let myself collapse onto my hands and knees in front of her. "I'm sorry, I'm so so so sorry, I should never have done that, I –"

Yali covered my mouth. "Rinn. Rinn." Her voice was low and soothing. "It's okay. [????? Stuff calculated to reassure Rinn]"

I didn't even have words to say back. I [????? gratefully [but more spilling-your-guts-everywhere–ish]] wrapped my arms around her legs.

?????

[?????"It's very strange," she said. "I don't think it's you, I think it's the Blood God. [????? I've been noticing this change in your pattern of behavior]. But… It the blood God shouldn't be about entitlement, contempt – anger is different than obsessive dislike" will]
