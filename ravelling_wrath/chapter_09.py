The darkness ?????verbed impatiently.

I couldn't see anything. I tried to move. It felt completely wrong. I was upside down. I was sideways. None of my arms or legs were where I'd left them. My left foot was on top of my head. My right thumb was riding a roller coaster ten meters to my left.



?????

I'd had <em>her</em> right in front of me! Why didn't I <em>do</em> anything? [????? More details]

Also, I could picture her right in front of me, so why was I drawing a blank when trying to think of her name?

I was sure I'd used her name loads of times before. I'd go "Hey Yali!!" – Right. Her name was Yali. But it didn't feel right. Like, that wasn't the word I was trying to think of. The word I was trying to think of was a lot more like, more like…

<em>The Farseer.</em>

A chill shot through me. So these were the Blood God's thoughts. Even the phrase "the Farseer" hadn't felt <em>quite</em> right, but it felt a lot <em>better</em>, as if it was, like, pretty close to the same meaning. As if there was some purer, godly word for the Farseer that I couldn't think of.

?????

[????? Feeling like the Seeking God was like a younger sibling that didn't know how to take things seriously]

I was getting better at recognizing the Blood God's thoughts. [????? Examples]

?????


"Have you seen Raylie??" He repeated.

"Who's Raylie?"

Morrow blinked. "Alchemist! Have you seen Alchemist??"

"Can't you smell them?" I said.




[????? The only thing I could see was] a clock inset into one of the walls.

The clock was running at a normal pace. It had a simple, blocky hour hand, and similar hands for minutes and seconds. The only unusual thing was a mark on the ????. "That's eight hours from now," I said.

"Betcha that means we've got eight hours to solve the puzzle!"

"Yeah, but… what puzzle?" I looked around the room. It was probably big enough that we could have lain down next to each other, but just barely.

"Okay, maybe the clock is the puzzle!" Morrow tried to take it down from the wall, but it didn't work. The clock was inset into the wall, and it was covered by a glass panel that was completely smooth with the surface of the wall. Morrow tried to dig his fingernails under it, but they just slid straight from the wall to the glass without catching anywhere.

"We must've missed something!!" said Morrow, agitated.

It was hard to imagine that we could have missed anything. The room was literally just a rectangle with neutral gray walls on all sides. To humor him, I checked the ceiling, and I even checked under my feet, but there was nothing special.

Morrow ?????, beating and scratching at the walls to see if there was any weakness. He was clearly looking for something that wasn't there. Mentally, I took a step back. ?????

"Oh, <em>I</em> get it now," I said. "The puzzle is <em>us</em>. The puzzle is how we're gonna handle being stuck in a room with each other for eight hours."

Morrow looked back towards me, eyes wild. "That's NOT a PUZZLE!!" he exploded. "There MUST be something else! This is SUPPOSED to be a PUZZLE! Give me a puzzle! Give me something to solve!!" he yelled, slamming his fist into the wall repeatedly.

I could tell denial when I saw it. I leaned back, crossed my arms, and watched him flail. "You know," I said sharply, "for something that's not a puzzle, you're sure having a hard time solving it."

<bigbreak>

"I'm NOT trapped in a room," Morrow moaned, curled up in the corner, tears streaming down his face. "I'm in a floating castle. With streamers everywhere. Everyone's happy…"

"Dude…" I wasn't sure what to say. Whatever was going on with him, he sure didn't look like he was having a good time. I wanted to say something sympathetic. But I just had no idea how to start. "I'm not good at dealing with mental health issues –" I began. Shit, that hadn't come out right. "I mean –"

"I'm NOT a PSYCHO!!" Morrow snarled at me from the floor.

"What the fuck, dude! I didn't say 'psycho', I said 'mental health'! You know, like something you can get help with! I'm just, like, not good at helping –"

"Well I don't NEED any HELP!! I'm fine, FINE, FINE!!" He turned and smashed his face into the wall, then reared back to do it again.

"What the fuck!! You can't smash your head on the wall, you'll give yourself brain damage!" I ran and grabbed his hair, yanking him back away from the wall to stop him. He twisted wildly in all directions, trying to get away from me. But for someone who was bigger and more frenzied than me, he was pathetically weak. Grappling with him, it felt like he had more bones than flesh. Pretty soon, I had him pinned in a position where at least he couldn't hurt his head anymore.

"Make it stop, help me, make it stop," he sobbed. "Help me!!"

"You sure about that?" I said irritably. "Because, literally ten seconds ago, you said –" I stopped myself. <em>Calming Game, Rinn.</em> It wasn't his fault if he was doing stupid shit. What I really wanted was to tell him something reassuring. But I wasn't very good at reassuring people about emotional stuff, even under normal circumstances. Ugh, what would Layo do? "Uh, do you want to talk about anything?" I said.

Predictably, that didn't do any good.

I <em>could</em> have just kept holding onto him for the next eight hours. That would probably count as a solution to the puzzle. But I didn't like watching people suffer, unless they were assholes. And Morrow might be pretty messed up, but he wasn't an asshole. So I racked my brains for something that could help. What would Layo do? What would Yali do? They'd probably both say something heartfelt and reassuring. But even if I could come up with something, Morrow probably wouldn't <em>get</em> reassured. Whenever anyone said something serious, he basically ripped it apart. Except for Alchemist…

"What would Alchemist say?" I said aloud.

"Raylie can't see me like this!! He'd be so worried and scared! I'm such a piece of shit! I don't deserve for anyone to like me!!" Morrow struggled wildly against my grip. "Let me go!!" he screamed.

"Dude, I'm not going to let you go if you're going to hurt yourself," I said. "Look, just don't think about Alchemist, okay? Forget I said anything."

"Yeah that's helpful, I'm going to forget right now!!" he said sarcastically.

"Uh, right, that was pretty stupid of me," I said. "What if we did something distracting? Like playing a game?"

"What game?!"

"Uh…" I hadn't thought that far ahead. Normally I could just manifest any board game I can think of, but of course that didn't work now. I stuck my hands in my pockets to see if I was carrying anything we could use as game pieces. But the only thing I pulled out was my phone, of course. "Hey, do you have games on your phone that you could play?"

I carefully allowed Morrow to take out his phone. He swiped through it aggressively. "I've already played all these!!"

"Well, uh, what if we swap phones? I don't have too many games, but –"

Morrow snatched my phone out of my hands. ?????

While he was doing that, I idly flipped through his phone. He had a <em>lot</em> of games. I didn't recognize most of them, but a bunch of them were ones that I'd mostly seen girls play rather than boys. Interesting…



?????

"Do the loopy thing," said Alchemist nervously.

"I CAN'T do the loopy thing because I CAN'T MANIFEST!"

"What's the loopy thing?" I asked.

Alchemist looked to Morrow, but Morrow was still pretty out of it. So Alchemist tried to answer. "It's a, thing, he does, to, not feel so bad? With his powers. Whenever he feels too, bad, it, magically makes him loop back to feeling better instead. That's why he calls it the loopy thing. But, maybe, it's not working? Not right now?"

"Would he – I mean, hey, Morrow, would you be able to do the loopy thing on me?"

"I CAN'T MANI –"

"I mean, when we get out of here. I kinda have some, uh, feelings, that I don't want to."

#I cut this: Stern take it, if I said anything he couldn't turn into a joke, he'd turn it into a dagger to stab himself with. The only way I'd ever seen him stop hurting was when he moved on to something else.
