The darkness jiggled impatiently.

I couldn't see anything. I tried to move. It felt completely wrong. I was upside down. I was sideways. None of my arms or legs were where I'd left them. My left foot was on top of my head. My right thumb was riding a roller coaster ten meters to my left.

I pulled hard, trying to get my body back under control. But that just made everything go even crazier. I struggled wildly, but it didn't feel like I was even exerting my muscles. The movement just <em>happened</em>. When that didn't help, I gave up and went limp, but it didn't bring anything back to normal. I was still constantly spinning around, bouncing up and down, turning inside out.

What <em>was</em> this??

I had to get at least <em>some</em> idea of how this worked. So I tried moving just one finger just a tiny bit, and paying attention to what changed. That made my ankle spin around. I tried moving the finger in the other direction, and it tried to squeeze my neck into my ear. I moved it back the first way, and it spun my ankle again.

One by one, I tried some more of my muscles. Each of them did <em>something</em> consistent, even if it wasn't what they were supposed to. So I kept searching, waiting to find ones that would make me spin <em>less</em> fast.

I found them, eventually. My big toe pulled my neck back out of my ear. My left eyebrow counteracted the spinning from my finger. It was a delicate balance, trying to slow down to an exact stop. I kept overshooting, and every time I overshot, I instinctively used the muscle that was <em>normally</em> the opposite, and that set something else out of whack again. But, slowly and unsteadily, I managed to get most of myself back under control.

Right when I felt like I knew what I was doing, everything exploded again. The smell of rotten fruit bounced and spiraled into my ear. Wailing sirens flipped over in my stomach. A kaleidoscope of unnameable colors rushed through my periphery.

Like before, I tried to focus on one sensation at a time. But as soon as I spotted a fleck of a particular color I could recognize, it split again, into another whole miniature kaleidoscope of its own. When I thought I recognized the sound of the siren, the sound changed into a thousand-part harmony of howling and steam. I tried to understand the new sensations, and they split again and again, taking everything that seemed understandable and turning it into a chaos of confusion.

And just when I couldn't take it anymore, when the sensations were about to overwhelm and break me, the Seeking God threw me into the world.

I tumbled onto a padded floor, my arms and legs suddenly coming back to me. I flopped and rolled until I was flat on my back, then stared up dizzily into… At first I thought it was another incoherent kaleidoscope of color. But then I focused in on part of it, and it actually stayed looking how it looked.

Above me, below me, and in every direction around me, there were thousands of brightly colored shapes.???? Curving, multicolored walkways that waggled and twisted to absurd angles, making no distinction between floor, walls, and ceiling.???? And everything felt so <em>close</em> to me. I felt like I could just jump up and land on any of the walkways I wanted.

I jumped up and spun through the air, landing somewhere that had been upside down when I started. I laughed and jumped again, grabbing and swinging from a giant wheel. So this was the Seeking God's world, the Endless Maze. It was like one giant playground.
[????? Somewhere in this chapter: explanation of "the endless maze"]

Technically, "the Endless Maze" meant three different things. This world was the original Endless Maze. But the Seeking God's symbol was also called the Endless Maze – that little symbol of [????? visual description]. And, metaphorically, "the Endless Maze" meant, like, life. Or the world. As in "how in the Endless did I end up like this?"

?????

Up to this point, I had never actually been completely alone. But now, I was in the new layer, and there was actually no one here.

<em>She</em> wasn't here.

I felt my blood pounding right behind my eyes. I'd had <em>her</em> right in front of me! Why didn't I <em>do</em> anything? I had just given her a half-assed kiss goodbye [????? make sure this is a correct callback] and stepped into that portal like I knew what I was doing. But I <em>didn't</em>! Now I felt like there was a hole ripped right out of my heart, like I'd missed my chance at her and now it was gone forever.

Also, I could picture her right in front of me, so why was I drawing a blank when trying to think of her name?

I was sure I'd used her name loads of times before. I'd go "Hey Yali!!" – Right. Her name was Yali. But it didn't feel right. Like, that wasn't the word I was trying to think of. The word I was trying to think of was a lot more like, more like…

<em>The Farseer.</em>

A chill shot through me. So these were the Blood God's thoughts. Even the phrase "the Farseer" hadn't felt <em>quite</em> right, but it felt a lot <em>better</em>, as if it was, like, pretty close to the same meaning. As if there was some purer, godly word for the Farseer that I couldn't think of. And that word… it was full of contempt.

"This is <em>not me</em>," I said loudly. "It doesn't matter what thoughts you try to put in my head. I know what you're doing, and I'm not going to put up with it."

Nothing answered me. Not sure what I was expecting.

Well, if the Blood God wanted me to feel torn up about it, I wasn't going to. "Okay, so maybe <em>Yali</em> isn't here now, but I'll have plenty more chances. I mean, we're gonna be together forever! Someday I'll be 80, and she'll be 81, and if there's anything we forget to do now, we can just do it then!" I felt kind of like I was lying to myself, stepping on my own toes just to spite the god. But it did make me feel better.



?????

[????? Feeling like the Seeking God was like a younger sibling that didn't know how to take things seriously]

I was getting better at recognizing the Blood God's thoughts. [????? Examples]

?????


"Heeyyyyyy!" yelled a voice. "Hey Rinn! Have you seen Raylie?!"

"Morrow!!" I yelled back excitedly. It was so good to see an actual person again, even if it wasn't the one I wanted the most. I ran towards him and tackle-hugged him, sending us both tumbling [manner related to current surroundings]

Morrow ?????  "Have you seen Raylie??" he repeated.

"Who's Raylie?"

Morrow blinked. "Alchemist! Have you seen Alchemist??"

"Can't you, uh, 'smell' them?" I said.

"She's right… here!!" Morrow waved an arm around himself vaguely, not giving me any idea of where "here" was. "I can feel where she is! I know where I am! But where's the way from here to there, huh? Huh??"

"I mean at least we could try going in that direction –"

"She's not <em>that</em> way or <em>that</em> way –" Morrow stabbed his finger in a couple of directions "– she's <em>that</em> way!" He waved his arm vaguely.

"Uh…"

"Whatever, you don't understand. Come on!" Morrow rolled to his feet, waving for me to follow him. I jumped up and ran after him. He was probably just going to lead me on a wild goose chase, but the alternative was my own wild juice chase after Yali, and I didn't have any idea where I was going either.

We weaved in and out between some floating curtains, quickly losing all sense of which way would come from. Pushing past the dozenth curtain, we found ourselves in front of a huge wooden gate.

The gate didn't have any handles on it. "How're we going to open this?" said Morrow.

"<em>The gate cannot be opened</em>," said a voice from nowhere.

Where had the voice come from? Thinking back, I wasn't sure I had literally heard it with my ears at all. It was more just an idea that popped into my head.

"Did you hear that too??" said Morrow.

"Yeah, it must be in charge of the puzzle. I guess we've gotta do something that's not opening it," I said. I grinned and summoned a Blood Blade. "Bet it doesn't count as <em>opening</em> it if you smash it to pieces –"

"<em>The gate cannot be smashed to pieces</em>," said the voice. A shiny, translucent coating appeared over the whole gate. I tried smashing it anyway, but my blade just bounced off the coating.

"Now that's just no fair!" I yelled. "You can't change the rules after we've already started solving the puzzle!"

"No, no!" said Morrow excitedly. "It's denying everything we say out loud –"

"Wait, that's right! So I just won't say it out loud –" I glared at the gate, then silently manifested a big ladder to climb over it with.

A dense row of spikes appeared at the top of the gate. "<em>The gate cannot be climbed over</em>."

"You absolute cheater!"

"I know how to deal with this!" yelled Morrow. "I'm going to <em>stay on this side of</em> the gate!"

"<em>The gate cannot be stayed on this side of</em>," said the voice, as an unseen force sucked us through the gate to the other side.

"<em>That</em> was the solution??" I demanded. "What the fuck, how was I supposed to know that was the solution?"

"Haha! Better luck next time!" Morrow ran on ahead. I hurried to keep up with him.

In the next room, there was ?????


????

"Will you stop that!" I yelled at the god. "It's not cool to push someone's buttons just for your fucking puzzle! I've had enough of this!" I charged at the exit door and stabbed a Blood Blade into it. It cut through the door like it was a piece of cheese. I slashed it a few more times, completely taking it to pieces.

I was about to step through the door when I noticed that it had nothing beyond it. Literally nothing. It was just a doorway going into empty space. Behind me, I heard Morrow snickering.

"What the fuck," I said. I whirled on Morrow. "What do you know that I don't?!"

"Haha! You haven't figured it out!"

"Figured what out?"

Morrow huffed irritably. "Come on, let's finish this puzzle! I bet we can get it in another go!"

"Fine! But if you call yourself trash again, I'm gonna smack you!" I stopped myself. I could already see where this was going. Morrow was going to call himself trash again on purpose, just to see if I would actually smack him. "Never mind, I'm not going to smack you, I'm just going to be totally fed up with your nonsense! Just a little bit, not that much! So don't even think about doing it to make me mad on purpose, it won't work!"

"Fine!" said Morrow. We glared at each other.



[????? The only thing I could see was] a clock inset into one of the walls.

The clock was running at a normal pace. It had a simple, blocky hour hand, and similar hands for minutes and seconds. The only unusual thing was a mark on the ????. "That's eight hours from now," I said.

"Betcha that means we've got eight hours to solve the puzzle!"

"Yeah, but… what puzzle?" I looked around the room. It was probably big enough that we could have lain down next to each other, but just barely.

"Okay, maybe the clock is the puzzle!" Morrow tried to take it down from the wall, but it didn't work. The clock was inset into the wall, and it was covered by a glass panel that was completely smooth with the surface of the wall. Morrow tried to dig his fingernails under it, but they just slid straight from the wall to the glass without catching anywhere.

"We must've missed something!!" said Morrow, agitated.

It was hard to imagine that we could have missed anything. The room was literally just a rectangle with neutral gray walls on all sides. To humor him, I checked the ceiling, and I even checked under my feet, but there was nothing special.

Morrow ?????, beating and scratching at the walls to see if there was any weakness. He was clearly looking for something that wasn't there. Mentally, I took a step back. There was definitely <em>something</em> we were missing, but it wasn't a literal, physical thing in this room. It was something about the whole situation. The Seeking God <em>seemed</em> random, but it always had a purpose. Why would it stick us in a blank room like this?

"Oh, <em>I</em> get it now," I said, realization dawning. "The puzzle is <em>us</em>. The puzzle is how we're gonna handle being stuck in a room with each other for eight hours."

Morrow looked back towards me, eyes wild. "That's NOT a PUZZLE!!" he exploded. "There MUST be something else! This is SUPPOSED to be a PUZZLE! Give me a puzzle! Give me something to solve!!" he yelled, slamming his fist into the wall repeatedly.

I could tell denial when I saw it. I leaned back, crossed my arms, and watched him flail. "You know," I said sharply, "for something that's not a puzzle, you're sure having a hard time solving it."

<bigbreak>

"I'm NOT trapped in a room," Morrow moaned, curled up in the corner, tears streaming down his face. "I'm in a floating castle. With streamers everywhere. Everyone's happy…"

"Dude…" I wasn't sure what to say. Whatever was going on with him, he sure didn't look like he was having a good time. I wanted to say something sympathetic. But I just had no idea how to start. "I'm not good at dealing with mental health issues –" I began. Shit, that hadn't come out right. "I mean –"

"I'm NOT a PSYCHO!!" Morrow snarled at me from the floor.

"What the fuck, dude! I didn't say 'psycho', I said 'mental health'! You know, like something you can get help with! I'm just, like, not good at helping –"

"Well I don't NEED any HELP!! I'm fine, FINE, FINE!!" He turned and smashed his face into the wall, then reared back to do it again.

"What the fuck!! You can't smash your head on the wall, you'll give yourself brain damage!" I ran and grabbed his hair, yanking him back away from the wall to stop him. He twisted wildly in all directions, trying to get away from me. But for someone who was bigger and more frenzied than me, he was pathetically weak. Grappling with him, it felt like he had more bones than flesh. Pretty soon, I had him pinned in a position where at least he couldn't hurt his head anymore.

"Make it stop, help me, make it stop," he sobbed. "Help me!!"

"You sure about that?" I said irritably. "Because, literally ten seconds ago, you said –" I stopped myself. <em>Calming Game, Rinn.</em> It wasn't his fault if he was doing stupid shit. What I really wanted was to tell him something reassuring. But I wasn't very good at reassuring people about emotional stuff, even under normal circumstances. Ugh, what would Layo do? "Uh, do you want to talk about anything?" I said.

Predictably, that didn't do any good.

I <em>could</em> have just kept holding onto him for the next eight hours. That would probably count as a solution to the puzzle. But I didn't like watching people suffer, unless they were assholes. And Morrow might be pretty messed up, but he wasn't an asshole. So I racked my brains for something that could help. What would Layo do? What would Yali do? They'd probably both say something heartfelt and reassuring. But even if I could come up with something, Morrow probably wouldn't <em>get</em> reassured. Whenever anyone said something serious, he basically ripped it apart. Except for Alchemist…

"What would Alchemist say?" I said aloud.

"Raylie can't see me like this!! He'd be so worried and scared! I'm such a piece of shit! I don't deserve for anyone to like me!!" Morrow struggled wildly against my grip. "Let me go!!" he screamed.

"Dude, I'm not going to let you go if you're going to hurt yourself," I said. "Look, just don't think about Alchemist, okay? Forget I said anything."

"Yeah that's helpful, I'm going to forget right now!!" he said sarcastically.

"Uh, right, that was pretty stupid of me," I said. "What if we did something distracting? Like playing a game?"

"What game?!"

"Uh…" I hadn't thought that far ahead. Normally I could just manifest any board game I can think of, but of course that didn't work now. I stuck my hands in my pockets to see if I was carrying anything we could use as game pieces. But the only thing I pulled out was my phone, of course. "Hey, do you have games on your phone that you could play?"

I carefully allowed Morrow to take out his phone. He swiped through it aggressively. "I've already played all these!!"

"Well, uh, what if we swap phones? I don't have too many games, but –"

Morrow snatched my phone out of my hands. ?????

While he was doing that, I idly flipped through his phone. He had a <em>lot</em> of games. I didn't recognize most of them, but a bunch of them were ones that I'd mostly seen girls play rather than boys. Interesting…

?????

"Are you kidding me!! That was my REAL phone!" I snatched it up from where it had landed on the floor. The screen was cracked and it wouldn't turn on.

Enraged, I smacked Morrow across the face, hard.

Morrow covered his head and cowered away from me. I stood over him, not even caring how he felt anymore. I felt so humiliated. I wanted to hit him again. "I've been trying to help you, and this is what you give me?!" I exploded.

Morrow kept his head down and whimpered, "I'm a piece of shit, such a piece of shit…"

"Yeah, that sounds –" I was about to say <em>that sounds about right,</em> but something stopped me. The way I was feeling – it was sickeningly close to how I'd felt when I had yelled at Yali on the first layer. And no matter how pissed off I was Morrow, I didn't want to go down that path again. <em>Controlling Game</em>, I said to myself. "Look, Morrow," I said, bringing my voice a lot closer to neutral, "just shut up, all right? I'm upset, you're upset, but it's just a phone. Both of us are way more important than it is. And if you say you're less important than the phone, I'll have to smack you again."

Morrow grinned up at me manically. "I'm less important than the phone," he said.

"Oh, for fuck's sake. Just shut up."



?????

That's when Alchemist walked in through the wall.

"Morrow!!" cried out Alchemist. "When you stopped answering me, I was so afraid – "

"Raylie!!!" Morrow ran and hugged Alchemist without slowing down, slamming them both into the wall. Before Alchemist could catch their balance again, Morrow was already yelling in their face. "It's happening again!! Help me, help me, you have to help me!!" Morrow grabbed onto Alchemist's shoulders, shaking violently. Alchemist's face flooded with confusion and distress.

<em>How dare he!</em> screamed a part of me. <em>How dare he hurt poor, sweet Alchemist!</em> I ripped his arm away from Alchemist's shoulder and heaved him back across the room. He stumbled and bumped into the far wall, covering his head again. I stood between them, all charged up, ready to take him down if he tried anything again.

"Do the loopy thing," said Alchemist nervously from behind me.

"I CAN'T do the loopy thing because I CAN'T MANIFEST!" Morrow screamed. It didn't look like he was going to try anything, so I stepped back a little.

"What's the loopy thing?" I asked.

Alchemist looked to Morrow, but Morrow was still pretty out of it. So Alchemist tried to answer. "It's a, thing, he does, to, not feel so bad? With his powers. Whenever he feels too, bad, it, magically makes him loop back to feeling better instead. That's why he calls it the loopy thing. But, maybe, it's not working? Not right now?"

"Would he – I mean, hey, Morrow, would you be able to do the loopy thing on me?"

"I CAN'T MANI –"

"I mean, when we get out of here. I kinda have some, uh, feelings, that I don't want to."

"Doing it on another person! That would be so weird! And interesting! I'd have to figure out their feelings at the same time I was doing it! But what if – actually it could be really easy! Because I don't have to feel it myself at the same time! But it would also – I'M STUCK HERE AND I CAN'T MANIFEST AND I'M GOING TO – MAKE IT STOP, MAKE IT STOP, HELP ME!!"

"I could, maybe, make a potion? That would help?" Alchemist [????? did the things they normally do to make a potion], but nothing happened. They did it again, but still nothing.

"None of our powers work in this room," I explained. "I think the Seeking God is trying to make us figure out… <em>that</em> –" I jerked a thumb towards Morrow "– without using magic."

"Oh…" said Alchemist uneasily. They reflexively took a step towards Morrow, but then stopped themself and looked to me for permission.

"Yeah, go ahead," I said. It didn't look like Morrow was going to do anything that would hurt Alchemist. He was still cowering with his head in his hands.

Alchemist hesitantly put their arms around Morrow's shoulders. They guided Morrow down to the floor until they were both in a sitting position, with Alchemist cradling Morrow's head to their chest while Morrow sobbed. Alchemist gently hummed an aimless tune, slowly stroking Morrow's head all the while.

Before long, Morrow was… not exactly <em>calm</em>, but a lot less frantic.

????? [????? Time passes, Rinn gets less agitated and the other to start kissing]

"Haha, get a room, you two," I said.

"This is the only room we've got!!" complained Morrow.

"I'm only joking, I don't really mind it. Get ahead and do whatever you want. Haha, I wouldn't mind even if you wanted to have sex in here –" What the furk was I saying? Well, I couldn't go back on it now. Time for the Rinn Akatura show, I guess. "It would be like the mile high club, except instead of being in an airplane you're in a –" <em>Wait, I shouldn't remind Morrow of where we are</em> "– I mean, hang on, if we don't have to eat, and we can heal all our injuries, does that mean we can't catch STDs? And, like, I don't know if pregnancy is the thing you two have to worry about, but –"

[????? Needs further consideration: "It does," said Morrow. Weirdly, he started talking in a completely matter-of-fact voice. "Some people come to the Otherworld to fuck because you're immune to disease and you don't have to get pregnant 'less you want to. It's not worth it because the portals are expensive and unsafe."]

#I cut this: Stern take it, if I said anything he couldn't turn into a joke, he'd turn it into a dagger to stab himself with. The only way I'd ever seen him stop hurting was when he moved on to something else.
