I'd had <em>her</em> right in front of me! Why didn't I <em>do</em> anything? [????? More details]

Also, I could picture her right in front of me, so why was I drawing a blank when trying to think of her name?

I was sure I'd used her name loads of times before. I'd go "Hey Yali!!" – Right. Her name was Yali. But it didn't feel right. Like, that wasn't the word I was trying to think of. The word I was trying to think of was a lot more like, more like…

<em>The Farseer.</em>

A chill shot through me. So these were the Blood God's thoughts. Even the phrase "the Farseer" hadn't felt <em>quite</em> right, but it was a lot closer, as if it was, like, pretty close to the same meaning. As if there was some purer, godly word for the Farseer that I was missing.

?????

I was getting better at recognizing the Blood God's thoughts. [????? Examples]
