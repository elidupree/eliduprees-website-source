Time moved slowly around me, agonizingly slowly. I didn't understand what was happening. In my vision, in front of me, there was a picture of my blade sticking out of the side of her body's ribcage. That didn't make any sense. It wasn't real.

Then her scream came crashing through my mind. Suddenly, my blood was pounding through every vessel, so hard, painfully hard. Why? My body had decided to tense up and flood itself with terror. Why? I didn't understand.

My muscles pulled in all directions at once. I crashed to the floor.

It was an old, familiar feeling, my body tumbling down, getting bruises on my arms and smacking my jaw into the ground. It wrenched out a memory from deep inside me. <em>I AM RINN AKATURA!!!</em> I screamed inside, trying to speak it with my mouth but barely managing a huff of air.

?????

If I saw where she was, the other me would lunge at her again. I crawled wildly in the other direction, clawing at the floor. I had to stay away, stay away from her, no matter what.

Her heavy panting filtered through to my senses. "All this planning, and I forgot how much pain <em>hurts!</em>" she gasped. It was at an angle behind me. That gave me her location! I could – no! I shook my head wildly, trying to forget where she was.

?????

Her heavy hands gripped my shoulders. I tried to thrash away. Her voice echoed in my years. "Rinn, are you there?"

"I AM!!" I screamed. "I CAN'T HOLD ON!!!"

"You can," she said decisively. "Just keep holding on. You are real. This body is yours."

The sound of her voice helped me focus on what was real. I
?????

Looking at her was the most terrifying thing I'd ever done. I wanted a hundred things at the same time. I wanted to run away. I wanted to hug her. I wanted to get down on the floor and beg for forgiveness and sob into her legs. I reached out to do it all at the same time. But I was frozen in terror.

"I apologize for putting you through this," she said earnestly. "But it was the only way to wake up the part of you that was still Rinn."

My voice came out shakily. "Are you seriously… apologizing to me? I – I stabbed you. I stabbed you! I stabbed, I <em>stabbed</em> you!! I – no! No no no –"

"It's okay. Look, I'm okay. I took a potion, I'm already healed."

I looked at her chest, uncomprehending. There was supposed to be a wound there, but there was just… her regular, unmarked sweater. It was like nothing had even happened.

"Say my name," she said.

I opened my mouth. I knew her name, of course I knew her name. I had said her name so many times, shouting it across the schoolyard, whispering it lovingly while she held me in her arms… I had whispered – "Yali. Oh gods, Yali." The topmost layer of fear and tension drained out of me. I was back. At least halfway.

[????? Introduce a new medium-term promise by this point?]

I ?????. "But – oh gods, oh gods, oh gods, how – what –" I held out my hand, opening and closing it as if it was a strange thing that wasn't part of me. This hand had done what? Suddenly I was shivering violently, my hands tingling and tears squeezing painfully from my eyes. Yali moved in, wrapping her big arms around me. I wanted to feel like those arms were warm and reassuring. I wanted to feel like they were holding me up when I was falling down. But the cracks inside me were too deep.

And then came the pain and rage. I tried to jump up, to run at the wall and beat against it. But Yali was holding me too tightly. I struggled against her, thrashing back and forth. "LET ME GO!!" I screamed.

"I'm not going to – oof! – to let you go if you're going to – ow! – to hurt yourself!" gasped Yali, struggling to hold on.

"I DON'T CARE! LET ME GO, LET ME GO, –" I managed to jerk away from her and jump up. Blinded by rage, I slammed my fist into the stone wall with all my strength. I pulled my hand back for a second swing, and I was about to do it again when the pain hit. My hand felt like it was splitting apart. Normally, pain would fuel my anger, but now, I was suddenly too exhausted to be angry. I slumped against the wall, clutching my broken hand, and sank down to the floor again, curling up in the corner and sobbing.

I was dimly aware of Yali and Alchemist sitting down around me, trying to comfort me. But I couldn't get up. I couldn't see past the pain.

It was supposed to <em>end</em>. There was supposed to be a point where I'd be like "okay, I'm done being upset now" and just manifest my hand back together and get on with figuring out what I needed to do next. But it wasn't happening. Even with Yali and Alchemist cuddling me from both sides, it wasn't happening.

"I can't even fix it… I can't concentrate on manifesting, I can't even picture what my hand is supposed to be like…"

"I could, maybe, make a potion?"

"Do it," said Yali.

Alchemist coaxed a potion out of the air offered handed it to me. With my good hand, I drank it down. It tasted sweet and filling. As soon as it went down, my hand was filled with warmth, wiping away the pain and massaging it back into its original shape.

"Gods, you're the best," I mumbled. I kissed Alchemist without thinking. Wait a minute, I had just kissed Alchemist when I hadn't even kissed Yali! Well, I could fix that. I turned to the other side and kissed Yali too. Yali kissed me back tenderly, then guided me towards Alchemist again. They went back and forth, kissing me in turn.

It only felt ?????loving for a minute. "Fuck, I don't deserve this!" I whimpered. ?????

"I HAVE TO GO!" I screamed. "I CAN'T BE NEAR YOU! WHAT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN!?"

Yali held me down. "I'll be using this Seeing regularly. If anything is going to happen, I'll know. I can take you with me all the way to the portal –"

"But it's not perfect! And you'll be on the Farseer's Path! You won't be able to use it for hours at a time! What if it happens in one of the futures you didn't check! What if – [????? I don't want, I don't want, I'm scared –]"

"I'm scared too," said Alchemist nervously. "Yali…"

[????? Is this the right moment for this?: Yali was silent for a time.

"I should have known," she said darkly. "You're right, of course. It's only a tiny chance, but it's not worth risking everything for that. I should have known it wouldn't work to be close to you."]

?????

"You can go straight to the exit portal. The Stern God won't approve, but it won't stop you. We'll meet up again in the next layer. It'll be okay."

But as soon as she said that, another horrible thought screamed in my head. "But what if I don't?! What if I get to the portal and I can't make myself go through it?!!"

"I, I –"

"What if you, used, the…" began Alchemist.

"I'm not going to use that," said Yali. "It's not needed."

"But, look how scared she is!" said Alchemist insistently.

"If she goes straight to the portal, there won't be any danger. There is no need to –"

"No need to what?" I asked.

"It doesn't matter –"

"Yes it does! It's something that could help keep you safe, isn't it?! You have to tell me!"

Yali glared at Alchemist. But, reluctantly, she explained. "I got a new power when I got to this layer. It's called the Watchful Eye, just like the symbol. It's a magic mark I can put on someone. Once I do that, I can see them constantly, no matter how far away they get, like I've got an extra set of eyes where they are."

"Do it," I said. "Stick it on me!"

"No," she said.

"YOU HAVE TO!" I yelled, grabbing her shoulders and shaking her desperately. "YOU HAVE TO, YOU HAVE TO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE!!"

She caught my wrists and held me away from her. "It's not right! Watching you every minute of every day –"

"YOU ALREADY WATCH ME IN THE FUTURE –"

"It's different! Even in the future I only see what <em>I</em> see –"

"AND I'M ASKING YOU TO DO IT! IT'S NOT WRONG IF I –"

"You're in no state to consent to this! It's not consent if you're, if you're –"

"LIKE ANY OF THIS WAS CONSENSUAL!! I DIDN'T CONSENT TO HAVE THE BLOOD GOD IN MY HEAD! I DIDN'T CONSENT TO STABBING YOU! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! I'M BEGGING YOU!" I sobbed, straining against Yali's arms to bring my face closer to hers.

Yali went silent again. For a long moment, everything was quiet except for the sound of my struggling. Tears poured down my face. It was hopeless. Yali's face loomed cold and impenetrable in front of me. She was going to deny me again. There was nothing I could do to change it. And then it would happen again. And it would be all my fault, all my fault… [????? Ordering of the sentences in this paragraph?]

"I'm begging you," I whimpered again.

"I –" Yali was about to protest again. But then, just a little, she broke. "I guess this is what I am now," she muttered.

I melted, my arms going limp and my body slumping down. She was going to do it.

"I guess I'm doing this…" Yali moved her hand towards me uncertainly. "This, this, this will put a permanent mark on your body, like a tattoo. The Watchful Eye symbol. The magic will only work while we're in the Otherworld, but the mark will stay forever. Are you sure –"

"'course I am," I muttered. "Bit of ink on my skin for your life, are you kidding me?"

"I just thought –"

"Some choices aren't that hard."

"Okay. Okay… okay, if I'm doing this… <em>where</em> should I put it…?"

"…over my heart," I said, dully but with certainty. "That's where I would want it." Mechanically, I tried to pull down the neck of my shirt to expose my heart. But we were all still wearing the Stern uniform, and it was too stiff. Giving up, I just pulled up the whole front. "Go on. Do it."

Yali hesitantly pressed her fingers over my heart.

It didn't feel anything like when she'd touched my heart on that first day. It was just an object touching another object. A cold and hot feeling briefly sank into my chest, then it passed. I looked down. The Watchful Eye was on me, a black symbol of an eye with an hourglass inside, drawn right there on my chest.

"Did it work?" I said. "What's it like?"

"It's like I can see you from all sides at once," said Yali.

[????? Rinn trying to do the paths the way she did before, through dissociation – the Rinn part of her recoils against that and they reach an awkward "compromise that no part of me was really okay with"]

[????? The Stern God tries to be in her mind, but she bars it out]

?????

How had this all gone so horribly wrong? I had only done what I felt like I was supposed to! Wasn't it RIGHT to destroy the Farseer? I'd thought it was the one thing I knew for sure! And I had finally tried to do it! I should have been happy. Why did I only feel all this guilt and fear?

?????
