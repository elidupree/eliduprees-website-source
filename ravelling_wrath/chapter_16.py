I watched Alchemist walk away, waiting until they were fully out of sight. No matter how serious things where, I really didn't want to scare Alchemist more than I already had.

Then I turned back to Yali. "So –"

Yali caught my wrist and pulled me down on the mat with her. Before I could react, she kissed me sloppily on the lips.

She did it clumsily and kinda smashed my lip against my teeth, but I didn't care. It had been so long, so <em>long</em>, since anyone had touched me like this. I pressed back into her, my lips and tongue drinking up the warm wetness of her own, my legs tangling together with hers. For the moment, I forgot everything. I could stay like this forever.

Clinging together, we sank down further onto the mat. I lay back and allowed Yali to climb on top of me, her flesh pressing down heavily on the whole length of my body. She never stopped crying, but she kissed me again and again. I closed my eyes and drifted in bliss, drowning in Yali.

I don't know how long we lay like that. My mind was empty of all thoughts, only pleasure and warmth.

But then, slowly creeping into my awareness, I began to notice that something had changed. Yali's movements had gotten rougher, and she was sort of clumsily pawing at me. Was she trying to be sexy? That… wasn't what I expected. I was definitely enjoying it, but it just wasn't like the Yali I knew. A tiny doubt was growing inside me, whispering that something was very wrong.

Reluctantly, I pulled my lips away from her. "Yali, what –"

That only made Yali cry harder. Before I could finish talking, she pressed me down on the mat and closed her lips over mine again.

But now that I had started, I wasn't going to stop. I wrestled her head away from me so that I could talk. "Yali, I don't understand! I mean, don't get me wrong, this is fuckin' hot, but, I thought, you always said –"

Yali struggled and tried to kiss me again, but I kept holding on. Once it sank in that I wasn't going to let her go without a response, she stiffened. Her face scrunched up again, sobbing uncontrollably. Her mouth moved awkwardly, trying to form words. "I – I – I don't want to die!" she blubbered. "I don't want to die before I ever have sex consensually!"

"I don't understand, you always said we're not going to die, what –"

"Justicar is going to kill us!" she blurted loudly, the words crashing at my ears.

"Did you See that?!!"

"No, but –"

I gripped her shoulders. "Then it's NOT going to happen! Didn't you always say that?! Neither of us is going to die! You'll always have a plan!"

"But my plans, they… I thought I knew what I was doing! But everything I planned… I almost got you killed! And then Morrow – it's all my fault!!"

"Come on, <em>Justicar</em> tried to kill me. You <em>saved</em> me. How are you even – wait, just because you didn't foresee it by magic –"

"It's not <em>just</em> that I didn't <em>foresee</em> it," Yali sobbed. "I was the one who told Justicar what happened. I didn't think –"

"Look, it's not your fault, there's no way you could have know AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, YOU SOLD ME OUT TO THE STERN <strong>AGAIN?!?!!</strong>"

For a moment, I was stunned. A whole second voice had ripped out of me. And a new feeling thundered inside me, saying that this was the <em>truth</em> roaring up through my lungs, that I was done with trying to sugarcoat what was glaring in all our faces. And in the next instant, I was gripped by the cold certainty that those thoughts <em>had not been mine</em>. I pushed myself away from Yali in terror. "No no no, not now, I can't let the Blood God take over –"

Yali's eyes were wide. "When… when did I sell you out to the Stern the <em>first</em> time?"

"Shut up shut up SHUT UP!!" The Blood God was roaring inside of me, desperate to have its say. I rolled over and looked away from her, grabbing onto fistfuls of grass and dirt, anything that could distract me from the thoughts that were clamoring on the edges of my mind.

Yali's voice came ripping from behind me, "I want to hear what the Blood God has to say!"

"I'll kill you!! I don't have it under control!"

Yali's hand came down heavily on my shoulder. She tried to pull me back to her, as I struggled away and fell in the dirt. She yelled after me, "In the Stern God's world, I searched the future for danger and I saw nothing! The Waiting God could have showed me your death, but it didn't! I need to know! What is the Waiting hiding from me?!"

?????

"Look for yourself!" I screamed. With a crash, the clouds split apart and a shaft of light landed on me. All over my body, wounds began to appear. A bloody gouge across my stomach. A dozen holes through my chest. Multiple slashes to my arms and legs, that felt like they could have completely severed them. Memories flooded into my mind, of myself, in my dozens of other bodies, crawling desperately as my lifeblood flowed away from me. The pain of the wounds flooded through me, but it felt like catharsis. I was finally laying the truth out in the open. "These are the wounds your Justicars and your <em>laskueh</em> have dealt to me! Now do you see what you have done?!" I screamed. I doubled over, blood dripping from my forehead into my eyes. "I have been blinded, maimed, brought to my knees, torn limb from limb! You destroyed my temple and forced my people under the law of the Stern! Your <em>laskueh</em> have trampled over my body to make your perfect world! But I will not go down without a fight! I will tear the worlds apart before I allow myself to be erased by <em>you</em>!"

"[????? the god speaking through me?]"

"Not exactly… The gods can't form human words on their own. It was more like… you were <em>interpreting</em> for the god."

?????

[????? not sure if this chapter or the next – in any case, towards the end of the big reveal

"[????? Should I use the unraveling potion?]"

"That <em>is</em> what I would have told you to do, as recently as the third layer…" said Yali. "But now… I am beginning to think that the Blood God <em>should</em> rejuvenate."

"[????? but what if Justicar was right? The Blood God has actually been pretty violent in its quest for revenge]"

"The Blood God is a god of anger, and it has been starving for the last 70 years. So are people less angry now? No, of course not. Anger has always been a part of, of, of humanity, of humans. The only difference is that now, their anger isn't being <em>overseen</em>. They don't have a god to… to bring meaning to their anger, to guide it to a better purpose."

?????

"I should have known. Whatever people think of the Blood God, it was never the god of holding a grudge. The god of holding a grudge is the Waiting God, because the Waiting God is the one that cares about the distant past and future. But the Blood God… I've learned a bit about the laws of the old Blood Temple, and they actually explicitly allowed revenge, but only if you did it quickly enough. For common assault, you were allowed to get revenge if it was within a few days, but not after that. If they seriously injured you, it was a lot longer, but there was still a limit. Even for murder. If someone murdered a member of your family, you had 18 months to get revenge. Not a day longer. And everything else was less."

"18 months… That's, less than two years…" ???? "Holy shit! Do you think that means –?"

"…that every year, the Blood God is only getting revenge for being murdered in the previous year?"

"And so if I survive this <em>one</em> time, it'll be over!"

"The Blood law for humans isn't necessarily the same system that uses for itself. Gods are different than humans. But we can hope."

"Holy shit."

?????

"I finally understand that word the Blood God used to talk about you as the Farseer! I mean, not exactly <em>word</em>, I mean, like, it's this concept in my head, –"

"I understand. I can feel the Waiting God using those not-quite-words, too."

"Yeah, so, the Blood God has always called you, like, the Waiting God's <em>laskueh</em>. And I first I thought it meant Raveller, but it doesn't. It means, like… a servant. Someone who works for someone else." Trying to explain it in words felt so flat. Saying <em>someone who works for someone else</em> didn't have the overwhelming sense of contempt that this word had. So I tried to explain. "And, like, to the Blood God, that's really bad. Like… If you obey someone else's orders instead of doing what you really want, that's like, stepping on your own blood."

"Stepping on your own blood…"

"Er…"

"No, it's familiar. Yes… it's an old expression. There were two expressions like that – if you said 'stepping on someone's <em>fire</em>', it meant you were stopping someone from going after their passions. But if you said 'stepping on someone's <em>blood</em>', it meant, it meant… a violation."

"So obeying orders is violating yourself? Haha, that's pretty cool."

"Sounds more like victim-blaming," said Yali loudly.

"No, it's not," I said instinctively. "That's a Stern way of thinking. You're thinking, 'well, the person who obeyed orders was doing something unholy, so it's their fault, so we don't have to be mad at the person giving the orders'. But <em>that's not how the Blood God thinks</em>. We <em>do</em> have to be mad at the person giving the orders. The Blood God doesn't forget where the real fault is just because you point fingers!"

?????

"So, this 18 months thing," I said. "Isn't that kind of unfair? Like, if you were abused as a kid – er, uh, I mean –"

"It's okay. Go on."

"Or, like, what about those things where someone comes out about how some scumbag sexually assaulted them years ago? Is it like 'sorry, it was 18 months ago, it doesn't count anymore'?"

"Ah… well, technically, it's not 18 months from the date of the <em>crime</em>. It's 18 months from your awakening of blood."

"Your what?"

"Your awakening of blood. It's… an important concept in Blood law. Let me see if my memories know enough to explain it. It's like, like, like, the time when you've fully realized how much of a violation it was. So, so, if someone was abused, but they're still telling themself they can pretend it didn't happen, their blood hasn't awakened to the crime yet. So the timer hasn't started for their revenge. ''',
