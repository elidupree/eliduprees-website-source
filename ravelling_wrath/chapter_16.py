I watched Alchemist walk away, waiting until they were fully out of sight. No matter how serious things where, I really didn't want to scare Alchemist more than I already had.

Then I turned back to Yali. "So –"

Yali caught my wrist and pulled me down on the mat with her. Before I could react, she kissed me sloppily on the lips.

She did it clumsily and kinda smashed my lip against my teeth, but I didn't care. All my rage was forgotten in an instant. It had been so long, so <em>long</em>, since anyone had touched me like this. I pressed back into her, my lips and tongue drinking up the warm wetness of her own, my legs tangling together with hers. For the moment, I forgot everything. I could stay like this forever.

Clinging together, we sank down further onto the mat. I lay back and allowed Yali to climb on top of me, her flesh pressing down heavily on the whole length of my body. She never stopped crying, but she kissed me again and again. I closed my eyes and drifted in bliss, drowning in Yali.

I don't know how long we lay like that. My mind was empty of all thoughts, only pleasure and warmth.

But then, slowly creeping into my awareness, I began to notice that something had changed. Yali's movements had gotten rougher, and she was sort of clumsily pawing at me. Was she trying to be sexy? That… wasn't what I expected. I was definitely enjoying it, but it just wasn't like the Yali I knew. A tiny doubt was growing inside me, whispering that something was very wrong.

Reluctantly, I pulled my lips away from her. "Yali, what –"

That only made Yali cry harder. Before I could finish talking, she pressed me down on the mat and closed her lips over mine again.

But now that I had started, I wasn't going to stop. I wrestled her head away from me so that I could talk. "Yali, I don't understand! I mean, don't get me wrong, this is fuckin' hot, but, I thought, you always said –"

Yali struggled and tried to kiss me again, but I kept holding on. Once it sank in that I wasn't going to let her go without a response, she stiffened. Her face scrunched up again, sobbing uncontrollably. Her mouth moved awkwardly, trying to form words. "I – I – I don't want to die!" she blubbered. "I don't want to die before I ever have sex consensually!"

"I don't understand, you always said we're not going to die, what –"

"Justicar is going to kill us!" she blurted loudly, the words crashing at my ears.

"Did you See that?!!"

"No, but –"

I gripped her shoulders. "Then it's NOT going to happen! Didn't you always say that?! Neither of us is going to die! You'll always have a plan!"

"But my plans, they… I thought I knew what I was doing! But everything I planned… I almost got you killed! And then Morrow – this was all my fault!!"

"Come on, <em>Justicar</em> tried to kill me. You <em>saved</em> me. How are you even – wait, just because you didn't foresee it by magic –"

"It's not <em>just</em> that I didn't <em>foresee</em> it," Yali sobbed. "I was the one who told Justicar what happened. I didn't think –"

"Look, it's not your fault, there's no way you could have known she was going to AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, YOU SOLD ME OUT TO THE STERN <strong>AGAIN?!?!!</strong>"

For a moment, I was stunned. A whole different voice had ripped out of me. And a new feeling thundered inside me, saying that this was the <em>truth</em> roaring up through my lungs, that I was done with trying to sugarcoat what was glaring in all our faces. And in the next instant, I was gripped by the cold certainty that those thoughts had not been mine. I pushed myself away from Yali in terror. "No no no, not now, I can't let the Blood God take over –"

Yali's eyes were wide. "When… when did I sell you out to the Stern the <em>first</em> time?"

"Shut up shut up SHUT UP!!" The Blood God was roaring inside of me, desperate to take control. I rolled over and looked away from her, grabbing onto fistfuls of grass and dirt, anything that could distract me from the thoughts that were clamoring on the edges of my mind.

Yali's voice came ripping from behind me, "I want to hear what the Blood God has to say!"

"I'll kill you!! I don't have it under control!"

Yali's hand came down heavily on my shoulder. She tried to pull me back to her. I struggled away and fell in the dirt. She yelled after me, "In the Stern God's world, I searched the future for danger and I saw nothing! The Waiting God could have showed me your death, but it didn't! I need to know! What is the Waiting hiding from me?!"

"<em>Everything!</em>" I yelled back, my voice crying out beyond my control.

"Then tell me! The potion I drank earlier is still protecting me! You cannot kill me even if you try! So tell me!"

Yali would be safe…

All my resistance collapsed like tissue paper. Triumphant power flooded into me – the power of Blood. Effortlessly, I rose to my feet and stood, straightening up to my full height, turning my face against the thunder. I was still half streaked with dirt, but that was no blemish on my boundless body. I flexed my hand, exulting in every muscle. I drew in a breath, the damp and earthy air exploding into my lungs like a stiff breeze after weeks spent cramped in a dusty room. And then… I looked.

There it was. The Farseer. The one I hated with the bottom of my heart, the one I kept insisting on loving.

And we were at a standstill. The sorcery around its body gleamed in my second sight, a shield that would set the world itself to block me if I struck against it. I could not pierce that shield, not while I was still divided. Not while I kept holding myself back from drawing on my true fire.

"Say what you must," said my voice.

The Farseer spoke. "Blood Child, when did I sell you out to the Stern the first time?"

The answer blazed in my mind with perfect clarity. I struggled to express it, to reduce it to human words. "A… long time ago. At the very beginning of this. It was you! It was you who… who <em>did this</em> to me!"

"What did I do to you?"

"Look for yourself!" I screamed. With a crash, the clouds split apart and a shaft of light landed on me. All over my body, wounds began to appear. A bloody gouge across my stomach. A dozen holes through my chest. Multiple slashes to my arms and legs, that felt like they could have completely severed them. Memories flooded into my mind, of myself, in my dozens of other bodies, crawling desperately as my lifeblood flowed away from me. The pain of the wounds flooded through me, but it felt like catharsis. I was finally laying the truth out in the open. "These are the wounds your Justicars and your <em>laskueh</em> have dealt to me! Now do you see what you have done?!" I demanded. I doubled over, blood dripping from my forehead into my eyes. "I have been blinded, maimed, brought to my knees, shredded limb from limb! You tore down my temple and forced my people under the law of the Stern! Your <em>laskueh</em> have trampled over my body to make your perfect world! But I will not go down without a fight! I will tear the worlds apart before I allow myself to be erased by <em>you</em>!"

The Farseer stood motionless. It silently considered my words, its thoughts unreadable. Even after everything, I was aching to hear how it would answer, hoping against hope for just one word of acknowledgment from behind that stony mask, one drop of pity or remorse. But the mask was as cold as ever.

Cautiously, the Farseer spoke again. "So the Waiting God is trying to erase you? And you kill the Farseer to stop it from happening?"

All at once, a wave of hopelessness washed through me, completely turning around my pride and rage. "To <em>stop</em> you?" I said hollowly. The feelings dropped me to the ground, sprawling with my face in the dirt, and ushered in another torrent of rain, a torrent that flattened my clothes against my back and pounded through them onto my skin. The blood from my wounds pooled and seeped into the soil. "To <em>stop</em> you?" I moaned into the dirt. "I will kill you and kill you and kill you, and when I am gone, you will still be strong. My hands are empty, and I am beating against the mountain. You call <em>me</em> the danger?"

Rainwater swirled around me, pooling and submerging half my face. The Farseer's voice rang down from above me. "I did see you that way. Maybe I still do. But I'm willing to reconsider."

Inside me, a thousand feelings blossomed from those words. Hope and vindication, contempt and despair. It couldn't be real. It was just another lie, another manipulation. What did the Farseer want from me, that it would play at reconsidering? I could <em>feel</em> its sincerity. I <em>wanted</em> to believe. But it had always made lies out of the truth. I couldn't dare give in to trust.

"Are you… are you okay down there? I don't want you to drown, or –"

I laughed, a short, painful laugh, gasping bits of water into my mouth. This Farseer was still a human, looking at me as if I was only a human, to be cared for like a human. In a way, it was sweet how sincere it was. I knew I couldn't trust it, but maybe it wouldn't hurt to be just a little closer to it, just for a while.

I hauled myself up to my knees. Crudely, my wounds began to knit themselves closed again. "My body isn't going to die from this," I said. "You know it takes more to kill me than a bit of matter."

The Farseer crouched in front of me. "I <em>don't</em> know. I don't know half as much about the Blood God as I thought I did."

It was tearing me apart how much I wanted to believe that. "Why are you saying that?" I begged. "Why do you toy with me?"

The Farseer examined me, full of doubt and concern. "If I understand you right, every time you've said 'you', you've been talking about the Waiting God. But what do you think about me – Yali?"

"But you <em>are</em> the Farseer."

"I may be the Farseer, but do you see no difference between me and the Waiting God? I am not the god! If the Waiting God is responsible for this injustice, I will do anything in my power to stop it!"

I stared at the being in front of me.

Now that I looked at it in detail, it was like an optical illusion, something that couldn't possibly exist. It was giving me a splitting headache. What – but – how – it was definitely a human! And it was definitely woven into the god! It even called itself a Farseer! But then how – how –

Memories came flooding back to me. How it had worked together with that broken fragment, the one we called Neenu. How it had fought against the Justicar, even bizarrely using deception, to prevent my death. A death the Waiting God itself had planned! And how it had claimed that the Waiting God had <em>hidden</em> things from it! How had I not realized before? <em>It</em>, the one I called Yali, was just as much of a broken fragment itself! Like a damaged clock with gears running at two different speeds, like a puppet wrestling for a grip on its own strings, like a parasite using its host's own strength to devour it, it was a flaw in the Waiting God's plan, and it was ripping and tearing to widen the flaw at every chance it had.

I tried to shift my focus, to look at the different parts of it. It was hard, because they were woven together so tightly. Every time I tried to see where one ended and the other began, it seemed to shimmer and shift. But slowly, I got a general sense of the shapes. The place where the transcendent web of the god twisted and meshed with… the other part. The human. Yali, I guess.

So Yali was the one I was talking to… Now that I thought about it, what should I even say to her? "Waiting… <em>laskueh</em>," I began contemptuously. But even that didn't seem quite right anymore. "You poor, pathetic thing. Did it really not tell you? Did it not tell any of the others?! That <em>monster</em>! So is that what it wants? It wants to commit the perfect crime! It would kill me and make even its own assassins believe their hands were clean!"

"I believe you," she said. "Can you give me more details? How does the Waiting God kill you each year? How did it start? And you said it destroyed your temple, how did that happen?"

I couldn't believe it. I was actually going to do this. I was actually talking to her. I was the Blood God, and I was <em>talking</em> to her! A peal of laughter burst from me, a sudden release of a tension deep inside. I doubled over laughing, laughing until I cried, straining the muscles in my sides and barely holding myself up. I gasped out, "I thought I could never live with me because I was trying to kill you! And <em>I</em> thought I could never live with <em>me</em> because I kept stopping me from doing anything against you! But <em>you weren't you all along!!</em> Ha ha ha ha hahahaha haha – urk –"

"Steady there. Breathe." Yali tried to hold me up. I took a minute to get myself under control, tears of laughter still leaking from my eyes. "Can you, can you, say that again, but, but, but –"

"Oh yeah, I guess that was confusing. So, there's me and me – wait –" I snickered. "I guess I can't say 'me' for <em>either</em> of us while I'm explaining it. So, there's… there's Rinn, and there's the Blood God. And I thought – I mean, Rinn thought the Blood God was trying to kill Yali, but it was only trying to kill, uh… let's say 'the Farseer'. And <em>I</em> – I mean, the Blood God – the Blood God thought Rinn was trying to – no, that's not quite right, the Blood God didn't understand that Rinn was a separate person? The Blood God thought… we?… were trying not to hurt the Farseer, when it was just Rinn trying not to hurt Yali."

"I – I – I –"

"I know what you're thinking. How are we going to kill the Farseer without hurting Yali? But that doesn't seem so hard, we'll figure something out. We're both amazing. And you too! All three of us are amazing." I slapped Yali on the arm. I grinned. "I'm so fucking happy right now! I can't believe it! This whole time, I've been fighting against me, and now I don't have to fight anymore!" I felt like there'd been an oppressive wall inside of me, and it was melting down even as we talked. I shook both of my fists in the air. "Now I am everything again! I am power! I am passion! I am… Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!" I screamed an exultant scream, shaking the sky with my joy. The power blazed forth from my heart, an unquenchable fire of strength, of sureness, of love.

My fire billowed around me. I rose effortlessly to my feet. Within my aura of flame, everything felt amazing. The rain boiled off of me, leaving me warm and dry. My remaining wounds faded away, my flesh made whole and warm again, my skin smoothed together into a single, beautifully sensitive organ.

In front of me, I saw Yali wide-eyed, a look of both fear and awe. In a husky whisper, she spoke:

[???? centered formatting:]
<em>The power I feel around me is the fire of my soul.</em>
<em>No wall can hold me.</em>
<em>No truth can hide from me.</em>
<em>No force can break me for as long as my blood still flows.</em>

A thrill rose through me as I heard those words. "That sounds like a prayer," I declared. It wasn't a question. I knew this prayer. I had known it for a thousand years. Countless generations of humanity had lived and loved and died, and at every step, they had called out to me, speaking these words, to take pride in their strengths, to celebrate their triumphs, to rally themselves against death and despair. Warriors had spoken them on the verge of battle. Parents had spoken them at the birth of their children. Lovers had spoken them together as they defied persecution. This was no Stern prayer. When you prayed to the Stern, you looked to the spires of distant temples, debasing yourself for the mercy of a power that stood above you. But when you prayed to the Blood God, you looked to your own heart.

Yali answered me. "Yes. The Blood God's prayer. You… I wish you could see yourself. It's beautiful."

I smiled easily. "I wish you could <em>be</em> me."

Getting the details was a lot harder than I had hoped. The Blood God – or at least, the part of me that was the Blood God – had a general sense of what had happened, but it didn't seem to remember specific things that happened the way a human would. Going through its memories took a lot of intuition and guesswork. Sometimes, something just felt right. But if I tried to think about it more, I'd lose it. Eventually, I settled into saying everything out loud as soon as it came into my head – and half the time, I'd immediately feel like, <em>no, I didn't say that right</em>. And then I'd have to say, "no, that's not right", so that Yali would know to delete it from where she was taking notes on her phone. And then I would try to think of something else and see if <em>that</em> was right.

"Stern take it, I thought it would be a lot easier to just let the god speak through me, like I was doing before," I said.

"No, it makes sense… The gods can't form human words on their own. So, it's less like the god speaking through you, and more like, like… you're <em>interpreting</em> for the god. So when the god's thoughts are harder to reach –"

"But the Endless Maze had some puzzles with words in them! And the Codex –"

"It's like I told you. The worlds are constructed based on our assumptions. Any words we saw came from the five Ravellers, one way or another."

"Ugh."

Eventually, with effort, we managed to get some information out of it. According to the Blood God, the Stern were being used as a tool, both in the Otherworld and in the city. In the Otherworld, once the Blood Children and Farseers had started killing each other, the Waiting had tricked the Justicars into thinking the Blood Child was always the aggressor. In most years, the Justicar ultimately killed the Blood Child, so the Blood Child was desperate to kill the Farseer before the Justicar was powerful enough to stop them. And in the city, the Stern Temple had violated the borders between the temples, undermined the structure of the Blood Temple until it was weak, and then destroyed it – all controlled by the Waiting, although I couldn't figure out exactly what kind of control that was.

And there was a number. Four. The number of years when the Blood God had hesitated before it began to fight back.

"I gave you four chances!" I roared. I was the Blood God again. This time I knew the "you" wasn't really Yali, but it still felt like the thing to say. "You killed me, and I still gave you another chance! Because you were my – my <em>family</em>! The first time, I thought it wasn't your fault! The second time, I thought it could have been a mistake! When you killed me the third time, I knew something was wrong! I was in pain, I was afraid, I could feel my temple in turmoil, but I still stayed my hand! I didn't want to throw away the trust I thought we had together! And for my trust, I saw the life choked out of me! The fourth time… I still did not fight back, because…" My voice broke. "I didn't know what to do. You were… strong, you were my…" Hot tears poured down my face. My thoughts cracked. Another memory had awoken, Rinn's memory of this year's Justicar standing over her. The helplessness… the inevitability of my death… I clung to Yali's shoulder. "Yali… help me… I'm scared…"

Yali held me, but she was distant. "If only we could verify this from the Farseers' memories… but of course, I only have the memories from the years they died… so, so… tell me about the first time you killed me!"

A sick feeling crushed in on me, overwhelmed and desperate. "I didn't even do it on purpose," I moaned. "No, <em>I</em> did it on purpose, but it wasn't, like, purposeful… I was in a rage, I wasn't sure… when I think of it from the outside, it's so obvious, but as a human, I… I remember, the Alchemist was there, the Farseer was telling them what to do… It was long and slow, they were helping me, they… no…"

I spent a while sorting out the memories. I had to keep going back and forth, trying to get it straight which memories were from one year and which were from another. I couldn't bear to let Yali take her arm out from around me, but she still took notes with her other hand while I talked.

After a while, Yali looked up from her notes. "So," she said, summing things up, "the Blood Child had some sort of disease, and the Farseer offered to help, but actually they manipulated the Alchemist into slowly poisoning the Blood Child. The Blood Child got sicker and sicker until they realized it was the Farseer's fault –"

"I wouldn't say I <em>realized</em>… they were just the only one in front of me, for me to blame… I mean, I know I was right, but…"

"Right. Eventually, the Blood Child was overwhelmed by bad feelings, and took out their anger by killing the Farseer. But it was too late to save themselves, and they still died afterwards. Does that sound accurate?"

"Yeah."

Yali grinned viciously. "This is great! This means that one of me died in the <em>same</em> year as they intentionally killed the Blood Child! Now I should be able to look in my memories and find out what I was thinking!"

Yali put her head down and concentrated, hunting in the memories. Pretty soon, she began to frown, and as time passed, her frown got deeper and deeper. Finally, her voice broke the silence.

"It's not there," she said.

<bigbreak>

My brain was <em>exhausted</em>

We were sitting in the middle of a huge mess of papers, copies of Yali's phone, and history books. Yali had laid down a hardwood floor over the whole clearing we were in, and everything else was strewn on top of it. It was a good thing it wasn't raining anymore, but the trees were dripping all over the place, so we had to keep all the papers in the clear area.

And most importantly, it was arranged in a giant timeline. Every year from the last eighty years had its own little section, with pages of information about the news and political events from that year, plus notes about what each of the former Farseers could remember about that year. And a few notes about what the Blood God remembered, although it was usually hard to pin that down to specific years.

"It's a good thing your monastery had so many old books," I said. Although even the history books hadn't given too many details about the fall of the Blood Temple. The juiciest bit we'd gotten was from a crumbling newspaper from the monastery archives. One article was about a court case about some Blood Temple councilmembers who had been arrested by the Stern police. But it didn't give much of the context. And it was a good thing Yali could manifest it more than once, because it kept falling to pieces.

Yali responded, "Honestly, I'm surprised at how many books <em>you've</em> been able to manifest. What with not caring about history and all."

"What can I say, I love putting my hands all over stuff."

Yali shuffled some things around. "More importantly, it's a good thing I already knew how common false memories are. Otherwise I'd be really confused by these inconsistencies. It looks like the only thing we can really rely on is the fact that you can't remember something that happened after you died. But that's, that's… sufficient," she said, frowning.

After what seemed like forever, we were done. We had mapped out the lives of all the Farseers from Yali's memories. All <em>sixty-eight</em> of them.

The history books all agreed on the first year the Farseer had been killed. And <em>every</em> Farseer in Yali's memories could remember at least two years after that.

"I should have checked!" yelled Yali. "I had these memories as soon as I knew I was the Farseer! Seventy years of dead Farseers, seventy sets of memories… <em>but there were never seventy sets of memories in me!</em> If only I had checked that there were actually seventy separate individuals in there!"

"Who in the Endless would think of checking something like that?? There's no way you could have known about any of thi–"

"No, I <em>should</em> have known! Whatever people think of the Blood God, it was never the god of holding a grudge! It would never have kept this going for so long! The god of holding a grudge – <em>is the Waiting God</em>."

"Wait, really?"

"Really. The Waiting God is the one that cares about the distant past and future. But the Blood God… I've learned a bit about the laws of the old Blood Temple, and they actually explicitly allowed revenge, but only if you did it soon enough. For common assault, you were allowed to get revenge if it was within a few days, but not after that. If someone seriously injured you, it was a lot longer, but there was still a limit. Even for murder. If someone murdered a member of your family, you had eighteen months to get revenge. Not a day longer. And everything else was less."

"Eighteen months… That's, less than two years…" ???? "Holy shit! Do you think that means –?"

"…that every year, the Blood God is only getting revenge for being murdered in the previous year? Maybe. The Blood law for humans isn't necessarily the same system that it uses for itself. Gods are different than humans. But we can hope."

"And so if I survive this <em>one</em> time, it'll be over!"

"If the Waiting God lets go," said Yali darkly. That wasn't reassuring. <em>When the Waiting God lets go</em> was an expression that meant something that would never happen.

"It'll <em>have</em> to! Once it knows it's <em>lost</em>!"

Yali was silent for a time. "I don't know if it <em>can</em> lose."

"I'm going to rejuvenate! It isn't! That's winning!"

"Even if we succeed… even if that happens this year…"

"It HAS to be enough! Now that we know – now that we know what's really going on, we've gotta be able to do something about it! We have to strike back!"

"That's what we would <em>want</em> to happen…" Yali sounded completely drained. "But it's the <em>Waiting God</em>. We have no idea how to hurt it. Even if we did, it's bound to be something incredibly difficult. And we, we… you don't realize how many ways there still are for us to die. Justicar might kill us. You… well… And I've even seen Morrow destroy your mind in some of the futures, if I don't step in to protect you. Striking back at the Waiting God… we just can't afford to think about that right now."

"But –"

"I don't want us to die. We have to focus on staying alive."

I tried to digest that. But I just couldn't. What Yali said was logical, but… every part of me yelled out to reject it. "This sucks!" I yelled. "I don't <em>want</em> my – I don't want Rinn to die, but what about <em>me</em>?"

Yali narrowed her eyes. "'Me' meaning the Blood God?"

"What? Look, <em>I, Rinn,</em> think we need to help the Blood God! You don't know how much pain it's in! Ugh, I can't believe I spent all that time telling it to shut up when it was afraid it was going to be killed!!"

"I, I know you feel that way, but –"

"It's all happening right in front of us! <em>Inside</em> us! How can you talk about just staying alive when it's being killed <em>right in front of us?</em>"

"We didn't choose this. We're not obligated to fix the gods' problems just because they forced us to –"

"You're seriously going to just let the Waiting get away with it?!"

Yali opened her mouth, then closed it again. She glared into the distance, seeming to have a long fight with herself. I knew I had her. There were a lot of things she could ignore, but <em>letting the Waiting God win</em> wasn't one of them.

"I'm probably making the wrong choice," she said. "Again. But… I do have an idea. A way to go against the Waiting God –"

"What is it?" I said excitedly.

"It's, it's… complicated. I don't think I can tell you everything yet. Do you trust me?"

"Of course I do!! You're – you're freakin' <em>Yali</em>! If you told me I had to rip my own arm off, I'd <em>do</em> it!"

Yali looked me directly in the eye. Her eyes drilled into me. Then she shook her head slightly. "I can't tell you everything yet," she said.

"Okay, uh…" I wasn't sure what to say to that. "Well, good luck with, uh, whatever it is."

"Thanks."

<bigbreak>

Hours passed. We got through all the most important things to talk about [, ????]. And I was starting to come down from the rush of the Blood God. It wasn't gone or anything, but I was mostly Rinn again. The Blood God was still there, a wellspring of strength waiting in my heart, and in every muscle of my body, that would be ready whenever I needed to reach for it. It just wasn't <em>me</em>, not right now.

I looked around. It was like I was seeing everything for the first time, again, but differently. This time, it all looked new because it <em>wasn't</em> awe-inspiring. It was just ordinary stuff, not the vivid, brilliant, unquenchable true reality I had seen as the Blood God. Just trees. Just rocks. Just the wooden floor. Just my back resting against some hard bark. Just… a mass of blood spread across the soil, seeping into a nearby brook and making it run red with blood?

"Uh… shit," I said, looking at it. That was <em>my</em> blood. Or the Blood God's blood, or something like that.

Yali followed my gaze. "Are you okay? I just want to make sure, since that's technically a lot of blood –"

"I'm fine, I still feel better than ever. I'm literally the Blood Child, I figure my blood is a special case."

"Yeah, that's what I assumed, too. Especially since, since, I think that's more blood than would actually fit in your body."

I laughed. "That river of blood, though… That's really how the Blood God feels about what's happening. I feel like I understand it a lot better now. Even the little things… like way back in the first layer, I was mad about you and Justicar working together, and I kind of assumed it was just me being mad about all her Stern stuff. And it was partly that. But it was also the Blood God thinking you were going to manipulate her against me."

"Oh, is <em>that</em> why you were acting so jealous about it?" said Yali distractedly.

"Jealous?? You take that back," I laughed. Yali chuckled.

I wasn't sure what to say next. Everything was still running through my head, but for all the things I wanted to say, we had already talked about them for ages. I decided to get up and stretch. But as I braced myself to stand up, I accidentally put my hand down on the tail of my shirt, and the back of the shirt tore right in half. Both the shirt and the jacket still had all those holes that my blades had put in them when I got pissed off about Morrow hurting Alchemist – ugh, we were still going to have to deal with Morrow. "Aw, shit," I muttered.

"You can manifest it back –"

"No, the shirt's fine…" I muttered. I shifted my weight and stood up for real. At this point, the bloodsoaked, torn-up shirt was pretty much just dangling off my body. "I was just thinking about Morrow. We still haven't figured out –"

"It'll be easier if we talk about that when Alchemist is here."

"It will? Even though Alchemist is, you know, –" Yali was giving me a steady look. "Whatever, of course you're right, you know the future and shit…" I idly tugged at the shirt, and it tore bit more. After a few more tugs, it came off in my hand. Not knowing what to do with it, I just chucked it on the ground.

Yali hastily looked away.

"Oh, right," I said, looking down at myself. "I'll just, uh, go behind a tree and clean up, alright?"

I stepped behind a big tree. I was kind of a mess, bits of dried blood caked onto my skin, dirt on my clothes and hair. So I just unmanifested my clothes again, then made a huge mass of cold water above me, letting it slam down on my head and shoulders and flush away all the mess. A few more torrents of water later, I felt clean and refreshed. Then I unmanifested all of the water, instantly drying me off. I finished by manifesting a new set of clothes, about the same as before, but all intact, cozy and warm.

I came back around the tree to find Yali concentrating.

"Alchemist will be back soon," she said.

"Oh! That's great! Wait, shit, when they left we were still –"

"I should use the Seeing to prepare," said Yali tiredly.

"Wait, really? When the Seeing lied to you before?"

"It did not… <em>lie</em>. The Waiting God is, is, is… it doesn't lie if it can help it. It's not like 'you must never lie' like the Stern or… I think the Blood God is all for honesty too… but it's still… the truth is the <em>foundation</em> of the Waiting. You know, like, 'You must tell the truth a thousand times before you will be capable of telling one lie.' So… I will be careful, but there are still ways I can make use of the Seeing. Just as long as I know I can't trust it completely."

"That's pretty twisted," I said.

Yali looked dismayed.

"No, it's cool," I said. "It's just so twisted. Now that we know the Waiting God is the enemy, I was assuming we'd be like, 'fuck everything Waiting'. But now you're talking about using the Waiting God's own power against it. And that's… badass, but… it's still the enemy's power! You can't make it <em>yours</em>, you can't make it <em>good</em> –"

"I'm not trying to. At this point, I'm trying to, to, to take advantage of it."

"Well, I hope it doesn't come back to bite you."

"I hope so too," said Yali. Then she corrected herself. "No. I don't <em>hope</em> anything. I will <em>make sure</em> it doesn't come back to bite me." Yali straightened up and focused. "Now, if you could give me some time to –"

"Yeah, go ahead," I said.

<bigbreak>

By the time Yali came back to the present, I'd had plenty of time to settle down, make a nice couch and sit back and think about things. Another realization had popped up in my mind.

"I finally understand that other word the Blood God has been using for the Farseer!" I said. "I mean, not exactly <em>word</em>, I mean, like, it's this concept in my head, like, you know…"

Yali hauled herself up from her Seeing pose, took a few breaths, and then thumped down on the couch and curled up next to me. "I understand," she murmured. "I can feel the Waiting God using those not-quite-words, too."

"Yeah, so, the Blood God has always called you, like, the Waiting God's <em>laskueh</em>. And I first I thought it meant Raveller, but it doesn't. It means, like… a servant. Someone who works for someone else." Trying to explain it in words felt so flat. Saying <em>someone who works for someone else</em> didn't have the overwhelming sense of contempt that this word had. So I tried to explain. "And, like, to the Blood God, that's really bad. Like… If you obey someone else's orders instead of doing what you really want, that's like, stepping on your own blood."

"Stepping on your own blood…"

"Er…"

"No, it's familiar, in my memories. Yes… it's an old expression. There were two expressions like that – if you said 'stepping on someone's <em>fire</em>', it meant you were stopping someone from going after their passions. But if you said 'stepping on someone's <em>blood</em>', it meant, it meant… a violation."

"So obeying orders is violating yourself? Haha, that's pretty cool."

"Sounds more like victim-blaming," said Yali loudly.

"No, it's not," I said instinctively. "That's a Stern way of thinking. You're thinking, 'well, the person who obeyed orders was doing something unholy, so it's their fault, so we don't have to be mad at the person giving the orders'. But <em>that's not how the Blood God thinks</em>. We <em>do</em> have to be mad at the person giving the orders. The Blood God doesn't forget where the real fault is just because you point fingers! And it makes them <em>more</em> bad, because it means they forced someone else into degrading themselves!"

Yali was quiet for a while before she responded. "Maybe what you're saying will make sense once I've thought about it more," she said neutrally. "But I've spent a lot of time doing what other people told me to. It's a lot to process right now."

"Oh, uh, right." It had been a while since Yali had reacted that way to something, but I still recognized it. It was probably really upsetting for her, she was just holding back. I made myself shut up.

We were both quiet for a bit, just sitting on the couch, Yali resting her head on my shoulder. We were still waiting for Alchemist to show up, there wasn't much left to talk about. I poked a foot at one of the papers that was still laying around. "So, this eighteen months thing," I said. "Isn't that kind of unfair? Like, if you were abused as a kid – er, uh, I mean –"

"It's okay. Go on."

"Or, like, what about those things where someone comes out about how some scumbag sexually assaulted them years ago? Is it like 'sorry, it was eighteen months ago, it doesn't count anymore'?"

"Ah… well…" Yali tiredly lifted her head. "Technically, it's not eighteen months from the date of the <em>crime</em>. It's eighteen months from your awakening of blood."

"Your what?"

"Your awakening of blood. It's… an important concept in Blood law. Let me see if my memories know enough to explain it. It's like, like, like, the time when you've fully realized how much of a violation it was. So, so, if someone was abused, but they're still telling themself they can pretend it didn't happen, their blood hasn't awakened to the crime yet. So the timer hasn't started for their revenge. And if they're a kid, and they don't feel like they have the <em>power</em> to get revenge, they don't count as awakened yet. There's… a lot of rules, just like how the Stern have a lot of rules for exactly when and how they can prosecute someone for a crime. Every temple has its complications…"

"Complications? I mean, what you said all makes sense, it's actually pretty close to how I would feel about –"

"Maybe. Let's talk about something else."

"Oh. Sorry."

"It's okay."

I couldn't think of something else to talk about. We both settled into a long silence, me fidgeting and Yali staring into the distance. There was just so much that had happened today. And from the look of things, it wasn't even over yet.

<bigbreak>

It wasn't much longer before I heard the branches rustling from Alchemist getting close to us. I got up and peered towards the sound, and pretty soon I spotted their cute head bobbing in and out of the leaves. They picked their way through the bushes along the shore of the brook, occasionally giving a nervous glance into the bloodstained water.

Beside me, Yali squeezed my shoulder. Quietly, she muttered, "I know you'll want to tell Alchemist about everything had just happened. But leave it for later. It's important that we let them tell us what they've been thinking of, before we distract them."

"Have they been thinking of something important? Like something that could –"

"Shhhh."

In front of us, Alchemist made their way through the last bit of brambles, and padded into the clearing with us.

"I'm glad you're back!" I said.

Alchemist smiled a little, but their eyes were downcast. They wobbled back and forth. They clearly had something else on their mind.

"I've had… an idea," said Alchemist.
