[????? not sure if this chapter or the next – in any case, towards the end of the big reveal

"[????? Should I use the unraveling potion?]"

"That <em>is</em> what I would have told you to do, as recently as the third layer…" said Yali. "But now… I am beginning to think that the Blood God <em>should</em> rejuvenate."

"[????? but what if Justicar was right? The Blood God has actually been pretty violent in its quest for revenge]"

"The Blood God is a god of anger, and it has been starving for the last 70 years. So are people less angry now? No, of course not. Anger has always been a part of, of, of humanity, of humans. The only difference is that now, their anger isn't being <em>overseen</em>. They don't have a god to… to bring meaning to their anger, to guide it to a better purpose."

?????

"I should have known. Whatever people think of the Blood God, it was never the god of holding a grudge. The god of holding a grudge is the Waiting God, because the Waiting God is the one that cares about the distant past and future. But the Blood God… I've learned a bit about the laws of the old Blood Temple, and they actually explicitly allowed revenge, but only if you did it quickly enough. For common assault, you were allowed to get revenge if it was within a few days, but not after that. If they seriously injured you, it was a lot longer, but there was still a limit. Even for murder. If someone murdered a member of your family, you had 18 months to get revenge. Not a day longer. And everything else was less."

"18 months… That's, less than two years…" ???? "Holy shit! Do you think that means –?"

"…that every year, the Blood God is only getting revenge for being murdered in the previous year?"

"And so if I survive this <em>one</em> time, it'll be over!"

"The Blood law for humans isn't necessarily the same system that uses for itself. Gods are different than humans. But we can hope."

"Holy shit."

?????

"So, this 18 months thing," I said. "Isn't that kind of unfair? Like, if you were abused as a kid – er, uh, I mean –"

"It's okay. Go on."

"Or, like, what about those things where someone comes out about how some scumbag sexually assaulted them years ago? Is it like 'sorry, it was 18 months ago, it doesn't count anymore'?"

"Ah… well, technically, it's not 18 months from the date of the <em>crime</em>. It's 18 months from your awakening of blood."

"Your what?"

"Your awakening of blood. It's… an important concept in Blood law. Let me see if my memories know enough to explain it. It's like, like, like, the time when you've fully realized how much of a violation it was. So, so, if someone was abused, but they're still telling themself they can pretend it didn't happen, their blood hasn't awakened to the crime yet. So the timer hasn't started for their revenge.
