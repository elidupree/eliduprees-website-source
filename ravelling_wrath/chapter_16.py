I watched Alchemist walk away, waiting until they were fully out of sight. No matter how serious things where, I really didn't want to scare Alchemist more than I already had.

Then I turned back to Yali. "So –"

Yali caught my wrist and pulled me down on the mat with her. Before I could react, she kissed me sloppily on the lips.

She did it clumsily and kinda smashed my lip against my teeth, but I didn't care. It had been so long, so <em>long</em>, since anyone had touched me like this. I pressed back into her, my lips and tongue drinking up the warm wetness of her own, my legs tangling together with hers. For the moment, I forgot everything. I could stay like this forever.

Clinging together, we sank down further onto the mat. I lay back and allowed Yali to climb on top of me, her flesh pressing down heavily on the whole length of my body. She never stopped crying, but she kissed me again and again. I closed my eyes and drifted in bliss, drowning in Yali.

I don't know how long we lay like that. My mind was empty of all thoughts, only pleasure and warmth.

But then, slowly creeping into my awareness, I began to notice that something had changed. Yali's movements had gotten rougher, and she was sort of clumsily pawing at me. Was she trying to be sexy? That… wasn't what I expected. I was definitely enjoying it, but it just wasn't like the Yali I knew. A tiny doubt was growing inside me, whispering that something was very wrong.

Reluctantly, I pulled my lips away from her. "Yali, what –"

That only made Yali cry harder. Before I could finish talking, she pressed me down on the mat and closed her lips over mine again.

But now that I had started, I wasn't going to stop. I wrestled her head away from me so that I could talk. "Yali, I don't understand! I mean, don't get me wrong, this is fuckin' hot, but, I thought, you always said –"

Yali struggled and tried to kiss me again, but I kept holding on. Once it sank in that I wasn't going to let her go without a response, she stiffened. Her face scrunched up again, sobbing uncontrollably. Her mouth moved awkwardly, trying to form words. "I – I – I don't want to die!" she blubbered. "I don't want to die before I ever have sex consensually!"

"I don't understand, you always said we're not going to die, what –"

"Justicar is going to kill us!" she blurted loudly, the words crashing at my ears.

"Did you See that?!!"

"No, but –"

I gripped her shoulders. "Then it's NOT going to happen! Didn't you always say that?! Neither of us is going to die! You'll always have a plan!"

"But my plans, they… I thought I knew what I was doing! But everything I planned… I almost got you killed! And then Morrow – it's all my fault!!"

"Come on, <em>Justicar</em> tried to kill me. You <em>saved</em> me. How are you even – wait, just because you didn't foresee it by magic –"

"It's not <em>just</em> that I didn't <em>foresee</em> it," Yali sobbed. "I was the one who told Justicar what happened. I didn't think –"

"Look, it's not your fault, there's no way you could have known she was going to AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, YOU SOLD ME OUT TO THE STERN <strong>AGAIN?!?!!</strong>"

For a moment, I was stunned. [????? Fix initial ambiguity:] A whole second voice had ripped out of me. And a new feeling thundered inside me, saying that this was the <em>truth</em> roaring up through my lungs, that I was done with trying to sugarcoat what was glaring in all our faces. And in the next instant, I was gripped by the cold certainty that those thoughts had not been mine. I pushed myself away from Yali in terror. "No no no, not now, I can't let the Blood God take over –"

Yali's eyes were wide. "When… when did I sell you out to the Stern the <em>first</em> time?"

"Shut up shut up SHUT UP!!" The Blood God was roaring inside of me, desperate to take control. I rolled over and looked away from her, grabbing onto fistfuls of grass and dirt, anything that could distract me from the thoughts that were clamoring on the edges of my mind.

Yali's voice came ripping from behind me, "I want to hear what the Blood God has to say!"

"I'll kill you!! I don't have it under control!"

Yali's hand came down heavily on my shoulder. She tried to pull me back to her. I struggled away and fell in the dirt. She yelled after me, "In the Stern God's world, I searched the future for danger and I saw nothing! The Waiting God could have showed me your death, but it didn't! I need to know! What is the Waiting hiding from me?!"

"<em>Everything!</em>" I yelled back involuntarily.

"Then tell me! The potion I drank earlier is still protecting me! You cannot kill me even if you try! So tell me!"

Yali would be safe…

All my resistance collapsed like tissue paper. Triumphant power flooded into me – the power of the Blood God. Effortlessly, I rose to my feet and stood, straightening up to my full height, turning my face against the thunder. I was still half streaked with dirt, but that was no blemish on my boundless body. I flexed my hand, exulting in every muscle. I drew in a breath, the damp and earthy air exploding into my lungs like a stiff breeze after weeks spent cramped in a room. And then… I looked.

There it was. The Farseer. The one I hated with the bottom of my heart, the one I kept insisting on loving.

And we were at a standstill. The sorcery around its body gleamed in my second sight, a shield that would set the world itself to block me if I struck against it. I could not pierce that shield, not while I was unable to draw on my true fire. Not while I wouldn't let myself.

"Say what you must," said my voice.

The Farseer spoke. "Blood Child, when did I sell you out to the Stern the first time?"

The answer blazed in my mind with perfect clarity. I struggled to find the words to express it. "A… long time ago. At the very beginning of this. It was you! It was you who… who <em>did this</em> to me!"

"What did I do to you?"

"Look for yourself!" I screamed. With a crash, the clouds split apart and a shaft of light landed on me. All over my body, wounds began to appear. A bloody gouge across my stomach. A dozen holes through my chest. Multiple slashes to my arms and legs, that felt like they could have completely severed them. Memories flooded into my mind, of myself, in my dozens of other bodies, crawling desperately as my lifeblood flowed away from me. The pain of the wounds flooded through me, but it felt like catharsis. I was finally laying the truth out in the open. "These are the wounds your Justicars and your <em>laskueh</em> have dealt to me! Now do you see what you have done?!" I demanded. I doubled over, blood dripping from my forehead into my eyes. "I have been blinded, maimed, brought to my knees, shredded limb from limb! You tore down my temple and forced my people under the law of the Stern! Your <em>laskueh</em> have trampled over my body to make your perfect world! But I will not go down without a fight! I will tear the worlds apart before I allow myself to be erased by <em>you</em>!"

?????

"So the Waiting God is trying to erase you? And you kill the Farseer to stop it from happening?"

All at once, a wave of hopelessness washed through me, completely turning around my pride and rage. "To <em>stop</em> you?" I said hollowly. The feelings dropped me to the ground, sprawling with my face in the dirt, and ushered in another torrent of rain, a torrent that flattened my clothes against my back and pounded through them onto my skin. The blood from my wounds pooled and seeped into the soil. "To <em>stop</em> you?" I moaned into the dirt. "I will kill you and kill you and kill you, and when I am gone, you will still be strong. My hands are empty, and I am beating against the mountain. You call <em>me</em> the danger?"

?????

"If I understand you right, every time you've said 'you', you've been talking about the Waiting God. But what do you think about me – Yali?"

"But you <em>are</em> the Farseer."

"I may be the Farseer, but do you see no difference between me and the Waiting God? I am not the god! If the Waiting God has hurt you, I will do anything in my power to stop it!"

I stared at the being in front of me.

Now that I looked at it in detail, it was like an optical illusion, something that couldn't possibly exist. It was giving me a splitting headache. What – but – how – it was definitely a human! And it was definitely woven into the god! It even called itself a Farseer! But then how – how –

Memories came flooding back to me. How it had worked together with that broken fragment, the one we called Neenu. How it had fought against the Justicar, even bizarrely using deception, to prevent my death. A death the Waiting God itself had planned! And how it had claimed that the Waiting God had <em>hidden</em> things from it! How had I not realized before? <em>It</em>, the one I called Yali, was a broken fragment itself! Like a damaged clock with gears running at two different speeds, like a puppet wrestling for a grip on its own strings, like a parasite using its host's own strength to devour it, it was a flaw in the Waiting God's plan, and it was ripping and tearing to widen the flaw at every chance it had.

I tried to shift my focus, to look at the different parts of it. It was hard, because they were woven together so tightly. Every time I tried to see where one ended and the other began, it seemed to shimmer and shift. But slowly, I got a general sense of the shapes. The place where the transcendent web of the god twisted and meshed with… the other part. The human. Yali, I guess.

So Yali was the one I was talking to… Now that I thought about it, what should I even say to her? "Waiting… <em>laskueh</em>," I began contemptuously. But even that didn't seem quite right anymore. "You poor, pathetic thing. Did it really not tell you? Did it not tell any of the others?! That <em>monster</em>! So is that what it wants? It wants to commit the perfect crime! It would kill me and make even its own assassins believe their hands were clean!"

"I believe you," she said. "Can you give me more details? How does the Waiting God kill you each year? How did it start? And you said it destroyed your temple, how did that happen?"

I couldn't believe it. I was actually going to do this. I was actually talking to her. I was the Blood God, and I was <em>talking</em> to her! A peal of laughter burst from me, a sudden release of a tension deep inside. I doubled over laughing, laughing until I cried, straining the muscles in my sides and barely holding myself up. I gasped out, "I thought I could never live with me because I was trying to kill you! And <em>I</em> thought I could never live with <em>me</em> because I kept stopping me from doing anything against you! But <em>you weren't you all along!!</em> Ha ha ha ha hahahaha haha – urk –"

"Steady there. Breathe." Yali tried to hold me up. I took a minute to get myself under control, tears of laughter still leaking from my eyes. "Can you, can you, say that again, but, but, but –"

"Oh yeah, I guess that was confusing. So, there's me and me – wait –" I snickered. "I guess I can't say 'me' for <em>either</em> of us while I'm explaining it. So, there's… there's Rinn, and there's the Blood God. And I thought – I mean, Rinn thought the Blood God was trying to kill Yali, but it was only trying to kill, uh… let's say 'the Farseer'. And <em>I</em> – I mean, the Blood God – the Blood God thought Rinn was trying to – no, that's not quite right, the Blood God didn't understand that Rinn was a separate person? The Blood God thought… we?… were trying not to hurt the Farseer, when it was just Rinn trying not to hurt Yali."

"I – I – I –"

"I know what you're thinking. How are we going to kill the Farseer without hurting Yali? But that doesn't seem so hard, we'll figure something out. We're both amazing. And you too! All three of us are amazing." I slapped Yali on the back. I grinned. "I'm so fucking happy right now! I can't believe it! This whole time, I've been fighting against me, and now I don't have to fight anymore!" I felt like there'd been an oppressive wall inside of me, and it was melting down even as we talked. I shook both of my fists in the air. "Now I am everything again! I am power! I am passion! I am… Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!" I screamed an exultant scream, shaking the sky with my joy. The power blazed forth from my heart, and unquenchable fire of strength, of sureness, of love.

????? more fire stuff; Yali is awed

No wall can hold me. No truth can hide from me. No force can break me for as long as my blood still flows."

Hearing those words, a thrill rose through me. "That sounds like a prayer," I declared. It wasn't a question. I knew this prayer. I had known it forever.

"Yes. The Blood God's prayer. You… I wish you could see yourself. It's beautiful."

I smiled ?????confidently. "I wish you could <em>be</em> me."

?????
<bigbreak>

Getting the details was a lot harder than I had hoped. The Blood God – or at least, the part of me that was the Blood God – had a general sense of what had happened, but it didn't seem to remember specific things that happened the way a human would. Going through its memories took a lot of intuition and guesswork. Sometimes, something just felt right. But if I tried to think about it more, I'd lose it. Eventually, I settled into saying everything out loud as soon as it came into my head – and half the time, I'd immediately feel like, <em>no, I didn't say that right</em>. And then I'd have to say, "no, that's not right", so that Yali would know to delete it from where she was taking notes on her phone. And then I would try to think of something else and see if <em>that</em> was right.

"Stern take it, I thought it would be a lot easier to just let the god speak through me, like I was doing before," I said.

"No, it makes sense… The gods can't form human words on their own. So, it's less like the god speaking through you, and more like, like… you're <em>interpreting</em> for the god. So when the god's thoughts are harder to reach –"

"But the Endless Maze had some puzzles with words in them! And the Codex –"

"It's like I told you. The worlds are constructed based on our assumptions. Any words we saw came from the five Ravellers, one way or another."

"Ugh."

Eventually, with effort, we managed to get some information out of it. A lot of information, actually. ?????

And there was a number. Four. The number of years when the Blood God had ?????

"[????? I gave you chances!]" I roared. I was the Blood God again. This time I knew the "you" wasn't really Yali, but it still felt like the thing to say. [????? Include a time the Farseer died in the same year as killing the blood child intentionally in this:] "You killed me, and I still gave you another chance! Because you were my – my <em>family</em>! The first time, I thought it wasn't your fault! The second time, I thought it could have been a mistake! When you killed me the third time, I knew something was wrong! I was in pain, I was afraid, but I still stayed my hand! I didn't want to throw away the trust I thought we had together! And for my trust, I saw the life choked out of me! The fourth time… I still did not fight back, because…" My voice broke. "I didn't know what to do. You were… strong, you were my…" Hot tears poured down my face. My thoughts cracked. Another memory had awoken, Rinn's memory of this year's Justicar standing over her. The helplessness… the inevitability of my death… I clung to Yali's shoulder. "Yali… help me… I'm scared…"

Yali held me, but she was distant. "[You said ?????. That means I died that year. I should have the memories! We can figure out more of what happened!]"

[????? Yali hunted in the memories for a while. She frowned more and more]

Yali's voice broke the silence, [????? grim/horrified]. "It's not there," she said.

"What?"

"The year you're talking about. The ?????first year the Blood Child killed the Farseer. I don't remember anything from it. I have the year after, and two years after that. [????? I've analyzed it based on memories of what year it was, and political/news events.] I know what year every one of my memories is, now. And the ?????first and ?????third years are missing."

"That's…"

"I should have checked!" yelled Yali. "I had these memories as soon as I knew I was the Farseer! Seventy years of dead Farseers, seventy sets of memories… <em>but there were never seventy sets of memories in me!</em> If only I had checked that there were actually seventy separate individuals in there!"

"Who in the Endless would think of checking something like that?? There's no way you can have known about any of thi–"

"No, I <em>should</em> have known! Whatever people think of the Blood God, it was never the god of holding a grudge! It would never have kept this going for so long! The god of holding a grudge – <em>is the Waiting God</em>."

"Wait, really?"

"Really. The Waiting God is the one that cares about the distant past and future. But the Blood God… I've learned a bit about the laws of the old Blood Temple, and they actually explicitly allowed revenge, but only if you did it soon enough. For common assault, you were allowed to get revenge if it was within a few days, but not after that. If someone seriously injured you, it was a lot longer, but there was still a limit. Even for murder. If someone murdered a member of your family, you had eighteen months to get revenge. Not a day longer. And everything else was less."

"Eighteen months… That's, less than two years…" ???? "Holy shit! Do you think that means –?"

"…that every year, the Blood God is only getting revenge for being murdered in the previous year? Maybe. The Blood law for humans isn't necessarily the same system that it uses for itself. Gods are different than humans. But we can hope."

"And so if I survive this <em>one</em> time, it'll be over!"

"If the Waiting God lets go," said Yali darkly. That wasn't reassuring. <em>When the Waiting God lets go</em> was an expression that meant something that would never happen.

"It'll <em>have</em> to! Once it knows it's <em>lost</em>!"

Yali was silent for a time. "I don't know if it <em>can</em> lose."

"I'm going to rejuvenate! It isn't! That's winning!"

"Even if we succeed… even if that happens this year…"

[????? Rinn desperate to have the Blood God win, because she's caught up in the realization; Yali wants to focus on this year and save Rinn]

?????

"This sucks! I don't <em>want</em> my – I don't want Rinn to die, but what about <em>me</em>?"

"[????? Was that you or the Blood God?]"

"What? Look, <em>I, Rinn,</em> think we need to help the Blood God! You don't know how much pain it's in! Ugh, I can't believe I spent all that time telling it to shut up when it was afraid it was going to be killed!!"

?????

[????? Yali gets convinced, not quite by Rinn's argument but by her own pre-existing grudge against the Waiting, and decides to execute the plan from chapter 19, but says something ambiguous. Perhaps something like "you're seriously going to let the waiting win!?" | Yali seemed to fight with herself, then changed her tune]

?????

"I finally understand that word the Blood God used to talk about you as the Farseer! I mean, not exactly <em>word</em>, I mean, like, it's this concept in my head, –"

"I understand. I can feel the Waiting God using those not-quite-words, too."

"Yeah, so, the Blood God has always called you, like, the Waiting God's <em>laskueh</em>. And I first I thought it meant Raveller, but it doesn't. It means, like… a servant. Someone who works for someone else." Trying to explain it in words felt so flat. Saying <em>someone who works for someone else</em> didn't have the overwhelming sense of contempt that this word had. So I tried to explain. "And, like, to the Blood God, that's really bad. Like… If you obey someone else's orders instead of doing what you really want, that's like, stepping on your own blood."

"Stepping on your own blood…"

"Er…"

"No, it's familiar. Yes… it's an old expression. There were two expressions like that – if you said 'stepping on someone's <em>fire</em>', it meant you were stopping someone from going after their passions. But if you said 'stepping on someone's <em>blood</em>', it meant, it meant… a violation."

"So obeying orders is violating yourself? Haha, that's pretty cool."

"Sounds more like victim-blaming," said Yali loudly.

"No, it's not," I said instinctively. "That's a Stern way of thinking. You're thinking, 'well, the person who obeyed orders was doing something unholy, so it's their fault, so we don't have to be mad at the person giving the orders'. But <em>that's not how the Blood God thinks</em>. We <em>do</em> have to be mad at the person giving the orders. The Blood God doesn't forget where the real fault is just because you point fingers! And it makes them <em>more</em> bad, because it means they forced someone else into degrading themselves!"

?????

"So, this eighteen months thing," I said. "Isn't that kind of unfair? Like, if you were abused as a kid – er, uh, I mean –"

"It's okay. Go on."

"Or, like, what about those things where someone comes out about how some scumbag sexually assaulted them years ago? Is it like 'sorry, it was eighteen months ago, it doesn't count anymore'?"

"Ah… well, technically, it's not eighteen months from the date of the <em>crime</em>. It's eighteen months from your awakening of blood."

"Your what?"

"Your awakening of blood. It's… an important concept in Blood law. Let me see if my memories know enough to explain it. It's like, like, like, the time when you've fully realized how much of a violation it was. So, so, if someone was abused, but they're still telling themself they can pretend it didn't happen, their blood hasn't awakened to the crime yet. So the timer hasn't started for their revenge. And if they're a kid, and they don't feel like they have the <em>power</em> to get revenge, they don't count as awakened yet.



?????

"[????? Alchemist is coming back]. I should use the Seeing to prepare."

"Are you sure? When the Seeing lied to you before?"

"It did not… <em>lie</em>. The Waiting God is, is, is… it doesn't lie if it can help it. It's not like 'you must never lie' like the Stern or 'only the truth will fulfill you' like Blood, but it's still… the truth is the <em>foundation</em> of the Waiting. You know, like, 'You must tell the truth a thousand times before you will be capable of telling one lie.' So… I will be careful, but there are still ways I can make use of the Seeing. Just as long as I know I can't trust it completely."

"That's pretty twisted," I said.

Yali looked dismayed.

"No, it's cool. It's just so twisted. Now that we know the Waiting God is the enemy, I was assuming we'd be like, 'fuck everything Waiting'. But now you're talking about using the Waiting God's own power against it. And that's… badass, but… it's still the enemy's power! You can't make it <em>yours</em>, you can't make it <em>good</em> –"

"I'm not trying to. At this point, I'm trying to, to, to take advantage of it."

"Well, I hope it doesn't come back to bite you."

"I hope so too," said Yali. Then she corrected herself. "No. I don't <em>hope</em> anything. I will <em>make sure</em> it doesn't come back to bite me."



?????


"I've had… an idea," said Alchemist.
