[????? Justicar was squaring off with me with the sword]

"So you're gonna kill me," I said hollowly. I was still sitting with my back to one of the statues. I could have gotten up to face her, but what was the point? In the state I was in, I wouldn't stand a chance against her.

"I have no choice," replied Justicar.

"You have to kill me when I'm helpless," I said bitterly.

"Where you helpless when you struck the Farseer?"

I had nothing to say to that. She was right. I was no better than a murderer.

"But I understand your meaning. To that, you must consider the position I am in. If need be, the Stern God will grant me weapons capable of damaging the fabric of the Otherworld itself. But it has always been my duty to minimize the harm that is done. That is why I must take the chance I have been given. I must kill you while you are too weak to summon soulfire."

"Soulfire? What's that?"

Justicar looked at me incredulously. "A Blood Child three layers deep, and you can't even summon soulfire?"

"See? I'm not what you think I am!" I said desperately, not trying to convince Justicar as much as I was trying to convince myself. "You don't understand –"

"I understand enough!"

?????

The sword hung high in the air above me.

A [????? adjective] relaxation came over me. So this was it. It would all be over soon. The sword would enter my body. I would die. There would be no one left to put Yali in danger. She would ?????

????? <em>Don't you dare sacrifice yourself for me.</em>

It was like my body moved out of its own accord. It flung itself sideways just as the sword swung down. It was so close that the side of the blade bruised my elbow as it passed. Rolling, I staggered to my feet, my muscles screaming from being yanked without a chance to prepare.

I was barely on my feet when the sword came at me again. I leaped to the side, barely fast enough to hear the woosh in my ear as it missed.

At every instant, I was an arms length away from death. Desperately, I wrenched a Blood Blade out of the air. Even that was a strain. I felt like my blood was far away from me, like I had to pull it through a ?????. And as soon as I was holding it, I had to twist my body to block Justicar's sword again.

The two blades met with a sickening thud. I could feel my ????? blade fracture from the force. I leaped backwards ?????

????? [I forced myself to make a blade in my other hand ????? breathing heavily] ????? She seemed invincible. What was I supposed to do?

How could she do this to me? Just days ago, we had spoken to each other. She had told me of her life, and I had told her of mine. And now she would tear that away?

"Am I worthy of my blood?" I demanded.

"Are your victims worthy of theirs?"

The truth burned inside me. If she was trying to turn my question around, that meant she still had some discomfort about what she was doing. And that meant I had a hook in her. "Answer me, yes or no!" I yelled.

"Do not imagine that I enjoy killing! I would like nothing more than to say that no one has to die! But what of the Farseer? What of the dozens or hundreds who will die if the Blood God is allowed to rejuvenate, as its rage infects our city once again?"

Justicar leapt at me again, her sword swinging in a powerful arc. But when she had paused to argue her case, she had given me just enough time to get my bearings. And now, I saw my chance. As the sword came down, I made a mesh of tiny Blood Blades along the palm and fingers of my left hand. I caught the sword in my hand, my blood closing around the blade and trapping it in place. I knew I'd only have an instant before Justicar had it under control again. So in an instant, I rushed forward, making another blade in my right hand and aiming it towards her. It was like my vision narrowed to a tiny window. The only thing that mattered was the point of my blade, zooming forward and inwards, ready to stab into the exposed skin of Justicar's face.

I saw Justicar react, moments too late. My blade landed squarely onto her cheek.

And then it <em>stopped</em>.

My bones shook with the force of the blow. Justicar lifted one hand from her sword and took the tip of my blade between her fingers. She firmly pushed it aside, making it scrape over her cheek like it was my fingernails being scraped over concrete. She didn't have a single scratch.

I stumbled away, uncomprehending. "<em>How?</em>" I gasped. How had my only weapon been so powerless to injure her?

"I told you, did I not? The Stern God's will protects me from all physical harm."

"No fair," I said, my voice breaking.

"The battle between good and evil should not be <em>fair</em>," Justicar declared. "The Stern God understands this. And that is why the Stern has granted me the power to do what must be done. [????? None of your failing has come anywhere near to changing this.] Even if you draw on a greater weapon, even if you <em>cut out my heart</em>, the will of the Stern God will always carry me forward."

She advanced towards me.

I ran.

Before I got five steps, I ran headfirst into a steel wall. Desperately, I pressed my palm to the cold steel, trying to unmanifest it by force. It flickered for a moment, not letting me past, but letting me see behind it. And behind it… was a <em>second</em> wall, which Justicar had placed there while I was dealing with the first.

Hopelessly, I turned around again.

Justicar was still advancing towards me, barely more than a sword's length away. Every road away from here was already blocked off by steel. I couldn't fight. I couldn't run.

"Get away from me!" I screamed. I reached out desperately for anything that could keep her away. I stuck out my hands and manifested a jagged mass of fragments, a thornbush of Blood Blades jutting out in all directions. I felt like I was pouring out the last of my heart.

Justicar sized it up, raised her sword, and shattered her way through my thorns in a single blow.

When the Blood Blades broke, <em>I</em> broke. The little strength I had left drained out of me. My body dropped to the floor, sprawling limply against the feet of the statues. Dimly, distantly, I could feel the pain and terror and ?????. But I couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't form a coherent thought. I was completely empty.

Justicar stood over me and raised her sword for a final time. A tiny part of me screamed that it was time to roll out of the way, but my body did not hear it. Not a muscle moved to take me out of her path. "In the name of the Stern, the Waiting, and every soul you place in danger," she declared. And then she plunged her sword into my unmoving chest.

The pain reached me as a distant echo. I watched, unfeeling, as my blood oozed from the edges of my wound. It was over… I didn't have to fight anymore…

Yali…

As my consciousness flickered, I tried to whisper her name. I couldn't even whisper. I tried to <em>think</em> name, holding onto the one thing that still made me feel a tiny flicker of heart.

Yali…

And then it almost seemed like she was there with me, standing solidly between me and Justicar, striking back to protect me…

<bigbreak>

She… actually was?

My mind raced to catch up with what was happening. Somehow, Yali had appeared right in front of me, fully solid and already in motion, crashing into Justicar and jabbing two fingers into the side of her throat.

Justicar leapt backwards, ripping her sword out of my body. [????? Or maybe it gets left there? Don't complicate the wound logic] "Was that a Severing Step?" she demanded. "That is not a normal Farseer power!"

"I'm not a normal Farseer." Yali's voice was cold and vicious. In the next instant, she whipped out a weapon of her own – a crude spike that buzzed with sorcery, glowing with a greenish, crackling light that felt like it was stabbing into my eyes.

Justicar stood across from her. With one hand, she still held her sword, dripping with my blood. With the other, she touched her neck, where Yali had struck her. The mark of the Watchful Eye was already blossoming there. "You had the advantage of surprise, and you chose only to place the Eye? You must be very confident that you can defeat me."

"I am," said Yali grimly. "If you had killed Rinn Akatura, you would already be dead."

That was funny. Justicar <em>had</em> killed me. I was dead, right?

Not taking her eyes off of Justicar, Yali knelt down beside me. "Take this," she said out of the corner of her mouth. She handed me a potion.

I struggled to hold the potion in my hand. My arms didn't even want to lift up off the floor. Still concentrating on Justicar, Yali carefully moved the potion to my lips. Obediently, I tried to swallow. I felt like I was choking. Half the potion spilled down my chin. But a little found its way down my throat. It started warming me on the inside. Just a little, like a candle on a cold night. But it was something.

?????

Justicar's sword pulsed with white light. For a moment, I was afraid that she would attack again. But she was only cleaning it, making the blood vanish from its surface. A moment later, she slid it back into its sheath. She stood at the far edge of the intersection, seeming like she was about to leave us. "Just tell me one thing," she said. "I would understand if you only chose to stand against <em>me</em>. The wills of our gods are not always in alignment. But you, every step of the way, have chosen a path that is far astray from the path of the Waiting God. I cannot fault you for standing against <em>my</em> god, but who are you to defy your own?"

Yali stood up and stared at Justicar for a long moment. Then she laughed – a long, cold, hollow laugh that rang out like a bell and seemed to shake the very statues around us.

"Who am I? I am Yali Seti, the betrayed daughter of Arinyo Seti, high priest of the Waiting God. I was six years old when she was called by the Waiting God to be its vessel. Six years old when she chose that call above her duty to protect me. Any god who would ask someone for that, <em>is no god of mine.</em>"

Justicar ?????verbed. Visible anger crossed her face. "The gods <em>always</em> have their reasons! You, of all people – for something that you didn't understand when you were a <em>child</em> –"

"You have nothing to say that will change my mind. Now <em>begone</em>."

"Very well," said Justicar. She adjusted the position of the sword on her belt. "But there <em>will</em> be a reckoning. I promise you that."

She strode away, with Yali glaring after her.

The moment Justicar was out of sight, Yali rushed to my side, all her grim determination replaced with panic. She put her hands around my arm and shoulder, clumsily trying to pull me up into a better sitting position.

"You don't need –" I began.

"Shhhh! Don't talk yet! Take the rest of your potion!"

"I'm okay," I said weakly. "See, it's already healing up." I patted my side where Justicar's sword had stabbed through me. There was still a hole in my shirt, but the wound in my body had closed up.

"No, you are not!" Yali thundered. "Your soul is still damaged! Half of that skin is a manifested patch! If you don't take more of the potion, you will <em>die</em>!"

"Okay, okay…" I let Yali feed me the dregs of the potion. Then she tried to collect up some of the part that had spilled. It was pretty gooey, so she was able to wipe part of the spill from my neck and let me lick it off her fingers. [????? I started feeling better]

Yali examined my wound again. It must have satisfied her, because she settled down from an outright panic to just drawn-out anxiety. "It's enough to keep you alive…" she said uneasily. "I'm sorry, I didn't think of, I, I should have brought a second potion, I – "

"Look, I'll be fine. If I'm not gonna die, we can just find Alchemist again later and get another potion. And as long as you're around to kick Justicar's ass if she tries anything –"

Yali's face turned ashen.

"I was bluffing," she whispered back. "I don't have anything that could have hurt her."

"What about –"

The spike she had been holding earlier was still lying near us, but its energy was already fading. She picked it up and stabbed it into her hand, and it just fizzled into nothingness. "I tried to make Alchemist make a weapon for me. Right after they made the Severing Step –"

"What's…"

"What's a Severing Step? It's how I got here in time. It's a sorcery that temporarily severs the link between your body and the world around you, so that your soul can pull you to wherever you want to be in an instant."

"An Alchemist power…?"

"I mean, Alchemist did it, but it's just a regular type of sorcery that regular sorcerers can do, too. You just don't hear about it much because it's too dangerous to use in practice. No one wants to risk tearing their soul or –"

"You did something really dangerous… for me."

"Of course I did. I will risk anything I have to to keep us both alive. And I will destroy anyone I have to, even if it's a god."

"Bad… ass…"





?????




"You're actually the daughter of Arinyo Seti? I mean, I knew you had the same last name, but it's a common name, I didn't think…" I babbled.

"It's easier if people don't know that about me."

The thoughts slowly clicked into place in my brain. "Holy shit, is she the one who… Wait, shit, I didn't mean to bring that up, I'm sorry –"

Yali looked at me incredulously. Then she laughed her harsh laugh again. "I <em>did</em> ask you not to bring that up, didn't I. But I see no reason not to tell you now."

<em>I see no reason not to tell you now.</em> Her words were infinitely cold. I could already sense that telling me would not be a kindness.

<bigbreak>

Arinyo Seti is not the one who abused me. But she bears some of the guilt nonetheless.

I will begin at the beginning. My biological father died not long before I was born. Arinyo Seti had never intended to raise me by herself. With her memory and attention issues, she knew that she was not prepared to live alone, much less to raise a child that way. In the home where I lived, trash piled up for weeks before she would clear it. More than once, the city shut off our water because she had forgotten to pay her bills. And even though she always made sure I ate before she did, there were some days when there was no food left in the house. We were not poor, and she had friends who were willing to help, but she rarely asked for help until I reminded her. By the time I was six years old, I was more organized than my own mother.

That was not her fault. That was not when she betrayed me.

[????? Bit of a description about how she got selected to be high priest, probably involving the old high priest, some other high ranking people, and the god]

?????

a husband and wife who could not have children of their own. [????? They were very nice and did over the top acts of love for each other]

?????

She honestly thought this was the way to give me the life I deserved. This was not when she betrayed me. 

At first, I thought she was right. I ate good food. I lived in a clean house. I missed her, but she had told me to trust the [????? name]s, and I believed her.

It was barely days before their performance fell apart. Everything they did in public was just an act to cover up how bitter and dysfunctional they were in private. They hated each other, they hated themselves, and before long, they hated me as well. There was hardly a day when they didn't find a reason to yell at each other. If [????? something was out of order, it was the other one's fault]. And if I tried to make them stop, they yelled at me too. They called me ?????, worthless. I started making sure the house was in perfect order, hoping there wouldn't be anything to set them off. But every time they caught me trying to clean up, they found a reason to yell at me for that as well. I quickly learned to clean up when no one was looking.

They had never wanted a child to love and care for. They had wanted a child because they thought, if they had to care for a child, they could ?????

?????

To keep me busy and quiet, they gave me the best computers and phones that money could buy. But that was their biggest mistake. I spent more and more time in my room, browsing the Internet, learning everything I could. And before long, I found information on child abuse. I learned that what they were doing to me was not normal, and, more importantly, not <em>legal</em>. And that meant that there was something I could do to change it.

I began recording everything they did. Every

<bigbreak>

?????

"How did your mom get picked to be the high priest if she had a bad memory? Isn't remembering the past really important to the Waiting?"

"Ah… she was always forgetting things she did earlier on the same day, but her memory for things that happened <em>twenty years ago</em> was flawless. In the Waiting tradition, people like that are actually considered blessed. It wasn't a blessing for <em>me</em>…" Yali said sourly, but then stopped herself. "But the ?????s did not have memory problems. If my mother's memory problems were the only thing I had to deal with, I would have been happy with that."
