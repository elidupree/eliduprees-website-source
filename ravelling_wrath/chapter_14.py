My eyes followed the point of Justicar's sword hovering in front of me.

"So you're gonna kill me," I said hollowly. I was still sitting with my back to one of the statues. I could have gotten up to face her, but what was the point? In the state I was in, I wouldn't stand a chance against her.

"I have no choice," replied Justicar.

"You have to kill me when I'm helpless," I said bitterly.

"Where you helpless when you struck the Farseer?"

I had nothing to say to that. She was right. I was no better than a murderer.

"But I understand your meaning. To that, you must consider the position I am in. If need be, the Stern God will grant me weapons capable of damaging the fabric of the Otherworld itself. But it has always been my duty to minimize the harm that is done. That is why I must take the chance I have been given. I must kill you while you are too weak to summon soulfire."

"Soulfire? What's that?"

Justicar looked at me incredulously. "A Blood Child three layers deep, and you can't even summon soulfire?"

"See? I'm not what you think I am!" I said desperately, not trying to convince Justicar as much as I was trying to convince myself. "You don't understand –"

"I understand enough! I was told that you could hold back the Blood God, [????? and for a time I was foolish enough to believe it [except not fully believe]]. But you are a Blood Child through and through, and now, you have crossed the final boundary. From here on, your very existence places us all in danger."

"No, no, no…" I moaned.

"I am sorry. But there is nothing I can do for you except to make this quick and painless."

She stepped forward. The sword rose up in an arc, gleaming with a white light, a numbing light that held me transfixed and tried to erase every thought of fear and pain.

For a long moment, the sword hung high in the air above me.

A strange relaxation came over me. So this was it. It would all be over soon. The sword would enter my body. I would die. There would be no one left to put Yali in danger. She would go on. She at least would escape from this place. Even if I didn't get to escape our fate myself, at least my sacrifice would –

<em>Don't you dare sacrifice yourself for me.</em>

It was like my body moved out of its own accord. It flung itself sideways just as the sword swung down. It was so close that the side of the blade bruised my elbow as it passed. Rolling, I staggered to my feet, my muscles screaming from being yanked without a chance to prepare.

I was barely on my feet when the sword came at me again. I leaped to the side, barely fast enough to hear the woosh in my ear as it missed.

I had no time to think. Death was waiting just an arm's length away. Desperately, I wrenched a Blood Blade out of the air. Even that was a strain. I felt like my blood was far away from me, like I had to pull it from the bottom of a deep hole. And the moment the blade was in my hand, Justicar's sword was already whirling towards my eyes. I had to twist my body to block it, both hands shoving my Blood Blade up in its way.

The two blades met with a sickening thud. I felt mine crack in my hand, terrible fractures spreading throughout its body from the force. I leaped backwards, trying to put even a moment's space between me and the onrushing death.

Justicar stepped towards me, unhesitating, inevitable. I tried to stumble away, breathing hard, my thoughts blank with terror. How could I ever stop her?! She seemed invincible. I reached out wildly in my mind for an answer, grabbing onto anything I could think of.

A thin shred of rage answered me, fragile but blinding. "I don't deserve this!" I screamed, trying to make it real. <em>Justicar</em>. How could she do this to me?! Just days ago, we had spoken to each other! She had told me about her life, and I had told her about mine! And now she would toss that away like so much trash?! If only I could reach her! If only –

The words sprang to my lips. "Am I worthy of my blood?" I demanded.

"Are your victims worthy of theirs?"

The truth burned inside me. If she was trying to turn my question around, that meant she was still carrying some guilt about what she was doing. And that meant I had a hook in her. "Answer me, yes or no!" I yelled.

"Do not imagine that I enjoy killing! I would like nothing more than to say that no one has to die! But what of the Farseer? What of the dozens or hundreds who will die if the Blood God is allowed to rejuvenate, as its rage infects our city once again?"

Justicar leapt at me again, her sword swinging in a powerful arc. But when she had paused to argue her case, she had given me just enough time to get my bearings. With that scrap of rage had come a fragment of my old power. I had the <em>right</em> to protect my life at all costs, to make her burn and bleed if she would not back down. And now, I saw my chance.

As the sword came down, I allowed one of my Blood Blades to lose its shape and flow over my palm and fingers like a glove. I caught the sword in my hand, my blood closing around the blade and trapping it in place. I knew I'd only have an instant before Justicar would understand and free it again. So in an instant, I rushed forward, focusing all of my will to form a blade in my other hand and aiming it towards her. It was like my vision narrowed to a tiny window. The only thing that mattered was the point of my blade, zooming forward and inwards, ready to stab into the exposed skin of Justicar's face.

I saw Justicar react, moments too late. My blade landed squarely onto her cheek.

And then it <em>stopped</em>.

My bones shook with the force of the blow. Justicar lifted one hand from the hilt of her sword and took the tip of my blade between her fingers. She firmly pushed it aside, making it scrape over her cheek like it was my fingernails being scraped over concrete. And once her fingers passed off of the side of her face, they revealed a smooth and flawless cheek, without a trace of a scratch to be seen.

I stumbled away, uncomprehending. "<em>How?</em>" I gasped. How had my only weapon been so powerless to injure her?

"I told you, did I not? The Stern God's will protects me from all physical harm."

"No fair," I said, my voice breaking.

"The battle between good and evil should not be <em>fair</em>," Justicar declared. "The Stern God understands this. And that is why the Stern has granted me the power to do what must be done. None of your flailing has had the slightest chance of changing this. Do you think a more powerful weapon would have saved you? The Blood God does not even comprehend what it is fighting against. A Justicar is not simply a human who will fold over when struck with a blade. Even if you find a way to pierce my defenses, even if you <em>cut out my heart</em>, the will of the Stern God will always carry me forward."

She advanced towards me.

I ran.

Before I got five steps, I crashed headfirst into a wall of steel. Desperately, I pressed my palm to the cold metal, trying to unmanifest it by force. It flickered for a moment, not letting me past, but letting me see behind it. And behind it… was a <em>second</em> wall, which Justicar had placed there while I was struggling with the first.

Hopelessly, I turned around again.

Justicar was still advancing towards me, barely more than a sword's length away. Every road away from here was already blocked off by steel. I couldn't fight. I couldn't run.

"Get away from me!" I screamed. I reached out desperately for anything that could keep her away. I stuck out my hands and summoned a jagged mass of fragments, a thornbush of Blood Blades jutting out in all directions. I felt like I was pouring out the last of my heart.

Justicar sized it up, raised her sword, and shattered her way through my thorns with a single blow.

When the Blood Blades broke, <em>I</em> broke. The little strength I had left drained out of me. My body dropped to the floor, sprawling limply against the feet of the statues. Dimly, distantly, I could feel the pain and terror and longing. But I couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't form a coherent thought. I was completely empty.

Justicar stood over me and raised her sword for a final time. A tiny part of me screamed that it was time to roll out of the way, but my body did not hear it. Not a muscle moved to take me out of her path.

"In the name of the Stern, the Waiting, and every soul you place in danger," she declared. And then she plunged her sword into my unmoving chest.

The pain reached me as a distant echo. I watched, unfeeling, as my blood oozed from the edges of my wound. It was over… I didn't have to fight anymore…

Yali…

As my consciousness flickered, I tried to whisper her name. I couldn't even whisper. I tried to <em>think</em> her name, holding onto the one thing that still made me feel a tiny flicker of heart.

Yali…

And then it almost seemed like she was there with me, standing solidly between me and Justicar, striking back to protect me…

<bigbreak>

She… actually was?

My mind raced to catch up with what was happening. Somehow, Yali had appeared right in front of me, fully solid and already in motion, crashing into Justicar and jabbing two fingers into the side of her throat.

Justicar leapt backwards, ripping her sword out of my body. [????? Or maybe it gets left there? Don't complicate the wound logic] "Was that a Severing Step?" she demanded. "That is not a normal Farseer power!"

"I'm not a normal Farseer." Yali's voice was cold and vicious. In the next instant, she whipped out a weapon of her own – a crude spike that buzzed with sorcery, glowing with a greenish, crackling light that felt like it was stabbing into my eyes.

Justicar stood across from her. With one hand, she still held her sword, dripping with my blood. With the other, she touched her neck, where Yali had struck her. The mark of the Watchful Eye was already blossoming there. "You had the advantage of surprise, and you chose only to place the Eye? You must be very confident that you can defeat me."

"I am," said Yali grimly. "If you had killed Rinn Akatura, you would already be dead."

That was funny. Justicar <em>had</em> killed me. I was dead, right?

Not taking her eyes off of Justicar, Yali knelt down beside me. "Take this," she said out of the corner of her mouth. She handed me a potion.

I struggled to hold the potion in my hand. My arms didn't even want to lift up off the floor. Still concentrating on Justicar, Yali carefully moved the potion to my lips. Obediently, I tried to swallow. I felt like I was choking. Half the potion spilled down my chin. But a little found its way down my throat. It started warming me on the inside. Just a little, like a candle on a cold night. But it was something.

Satisfied, Yali stood again. "Now begone. Leave us before I change my mind."

Justicar's sword pulsed with white light. For a moment, I was afraid that she would attack again. But she was only cleaning it, making the blood vanish from its surface. A moment later, she slid it back into its sheath. She stood at the far edge of the intersection, seeming like she was about to leave us. "Just tell me one thing," she said. "I would understand if you only chose to stand against <em>me</em>. The wills of our gods are not always in alignment. But you, every step of the way, have chosen a path that is far astray from the path of the Waiting God. I cannot fault you for standing against <em>my</em> god, but who are you to defy your own?"

Yali stared at Justicar for a long moment. Then she laughed – a long, cold, hollow laugh that rang out like a bell and seemed to shake the very statues around us.

"Who am I? I am Yali Seti, the betrayed daughter of Arinyo Seti, high priest of the Waiting God. I was six years old when she was called by the Waiting God to be its vessel. Six years old when she chose that call above her duty to protect me. Any god who would ask someone for that, <em>is no god of mine.</em>"

Justicar tensed. Visible anger crossed her face. "The gods <em>always</em> have their reasons! You, of all people – for something that you didn't understand when you were a <em>child</em> –"

"You have nothing to say that will change my mind. Now <em>begone</em>."

"Very well," said Justicar coldly. She adjusted the position of the sword on her belt. "But there <em>will</em> be a reckoning. I promise you that."

She strode away, with Yali glaring after her.

The moment Justicar was out of sight, Yali rushed to my side, all her grim determination replaced with panic. She put her hands around my arm and shoulder, clumsily trying to pull me up into a better sitting position.

"You don't need –" I began.

"Shhhh! Don't talk yet! Take the rest of your potion!"

"I'm okay," I said weakly. "See, it's already heal– ow–" I patted my side where Justicar's sword had stabbed through me. There was still a hole in my shirt, but the wound in my body had closed up.

"No, you are not!" Yali thundered. "Your soul is still damaged! Half of that skin is a manifested patch! If you don't take more of the potion, you will <em>die</em>!"

"Okay, okay…" I let Yali feed me the dregs of the potion. Then she tried to collect up some of the part that had spilled. It was pretty gooey, so she was able to wipe part of the spill from my neck and let me lick it off her fingers. I was almost able to get distracted, just sucking on her fingers, but she didn't let me. Still, the potion was definitely making me feel a little better, life oozing back into my body.

Yali examined my wound again. It must have satisfied her, because she settled down from an outright panic to just drawn-out anxiety. "It's enough to keep you alive…" she said uneasily. "I'm sorry, I didn't think of, I, I should have brought a second potion, I – "

"Look, I'll be fine…" I muttered, straining to speak. "Alchemist can make another… And as long as you're around to kick Justicar's ass if she tries anyth…"

Yali's face turned ashen.

"I was bluffing," she whispered back. "I don't have anything that could have hurt her."

"What about –"

The spike she had been holding earlier was still lying near us, but its energy was already fading. She picked it up and stabbed it into her hand, and it just fizzled into nothingness. "I tried to make Alchemist make a weapon for me. Right after they made the Severing Step. But they couldn't! They won't think of how to hurt people even when they NEED to! If I'd had more time –"

"What's… sev…"

"What's a Severing Step? It's how I got here in time. It's a sorcery that temporarily severs the link between your body and the world around you, so that your soul can pull you to wherever you want to be in an instant –"

"An Alchemist power…?"

"I mean, Alchemist did it, but it's just a regular type of sorcery that regular sorcerers can do, too. You just don't hear about it much because it's too dangerous to use in practice. No one wants to risk tearing their soul or –"

"You did something really dangerous… for me."

"Of course I did. I will risk anything I need to, to keep us both alive."

"Bad… ass…"

Yali blushed a little, but suddenly turned agitated again. "That doesn't matter right now! The important thing is keeping you safe! I, I, I need to think! I <em>don't know what's about to happen!</em>"

It took me a moment to realize what that implied. "Wait, the Seeing –?"

"I don't know why I didn't see that this was going to happen! I <em>used</em> the Seeing! I specifically looked for danger! I didn't see Justicar attacking you! Why couldn't I find it?!"

"Could the Stern God… uh… mess it up somehow?"

"I don't know! It doesn't feel like it! But, but, I <em>don't know!</em> Until I understand why it didn't work, I can't assume that we're safe, ever again! So! First of all, I am <em>not</em> leaving your side again, and I don't care what you have to say about it!"

"…yeah… okay…"

"Good! Now, second, we need to get you to Alchemist as soon as we can! And then we need to get you out of this layer before anything worse happens! But, but, how, how are we going to meet up with Alchemist? If I'd – I didn't think of having a way to contact them –"

"Morrow!"

"What?"

It was too much work to explain, so I just did it. I opened my mind, calling out for Morrow with my thoughts.

Almost immediately, I felt his voice in my head. It didn't actually <em>sound</em> like his voice – it actually sounded more like my own thoughts. But it was obviously him. <em>What happened?? Did Yali beat Justicar?! Wait wait I've gotta tell Raylie, he's so worried –</em>

"Morrow. <em>Please</em> shut up," I said out loud.

<bigbreak>

It was a lot of negotiating and confusion, trying to communicate through Morrow. I didn't know how Alchemist could stand it all the time. But we managed to do it. We planned out a spot to meet up, mostly taking the Alchemist's Path to meet each other.

Yali didn't want me to walk. "I'll carry you. No, no, that would jostle you too. We, we, we should put you in one of those rolling hospital beds." She stuck out her hands, but nothing happened. "I must not have one imprinted… I think I've only seen them in shows…"

"I think I was in one when my leg was broken…"

Manifesting was still agonizingly difficult, but I did it. So now here we were, Yali pushing me along in a hospital bed, occasionally shouting out to order the statues out of the way.

Being carted along in bed gave me some time to process what had just happened. Or try to. My brain was still a mass of dull pain and shock. My train of thought drifted randomly. I babbled whatever came into my head. [????? Consider including two more things Rinn babbles before this, and have Yali reply "Shh" each time:] "You're actually the daughter of Arinyo Seti? I mean, I knew you had the same last name, but it's a common name, I didn't think…"

"It's easier if people don't know that about me."

The thoughts slowly clicked into place in my brain. "Holy shit, is she the one who… Wait, shit, I didn't mean to bring that up, I'm sorry –"

Yali looked at me incredulously. Then she laughed her harsh laugh again. "I <em>did</em> ask you not to bring that up, didn't I. But I see no reason not to tell you now."

<em>I see no reason not to tell you now.</em> Her words were infinitely cold. She was going to tell me, but there was no warmth in this, no kindness, no sense of closeness or vulnerability.

<bigbreak>

Arinyo Seti is not the one who abused me. But [????? she bears some of the guilt] nonetheless.

I will begin at the beginning. My biological father died not long before I was born. Arinyo Seti had never intended to raise me by herself. With her memory and attention issues, she knew that she was not prepared to live alone, much less to raise a child that way. In the home where I lived, trash piled up for weeks before she would clear it. More than once, the city shut off our water because she had forgotten to pay her bills. And even though she always made sure I ate before she did, there were some days when there was no food left in the house. We were not poor, and she had friends who were willing to help, but she rarely asked for help until I reminded her. By the time I was six years old, I was more organized than my own mother.

That was not her fault. That was not when she betrayed me.

I was only dimly aware of the negotiations for her to become high priest. There were long meetings for her to go to, meetings with the old high priest and his advisers, rituals where they consulted with the god. As a child, I was only aware of her absences. But I could also feel her hope for the future. She finally had a calling that made sense to her. And I hoped for her too.

So when she explained to me that I would be given to another family when she was [?????anointed? ordained? as high priest], I believed it was something I could accept. She explained that they would take care of me from then on, that they would give me the care and nurturing that she could not. She honestly thought this was the way to give me the life I deserved. This was not when she betrayed me. 

????? and ????? ?????surname were praised and respected by everyone in our community. They were fashionable. They gave generously to good causes. And everyone remembered their grand gestures of love for each other, the surprise romantic messages they delivered at their formal parties. They always laughed and smiled charmingly, and whenever they were praised, they deflected it with modesty.

And at the same time, they were a husband and wife who could not have children of their own. So it seemed only natural that they would be a good candidate to care for the high priest's child when she was consumed by her duties. Everyone told me it was a perfect match. They said it was sad I would be away from my mother, but they could not imagine a better replacement.

At first, I thought they were right. I ate good food. I lived in a clean house. I missed my mother, but she had told me to trust the [????? name]s, and I believed her.

It was barely days before their performance fell apart. Everything they did in public was just an act to cover up how bitter and dysfunctional they were in private. They hated each other, they hated themselves, and before long, they hated me as well. There was hardly a day when they didn't find a reason to yell at each other. I have a clear memory of a day when they blamed each other for hours over a stain on one of their tabletops. A stain I could barely even see. If either of them saw something that was out of its perfect order, it was the other one's fault.

And if I ever spoke up to make them stop, they yelled at me as well. They called me worthless. They called me an inconvenience. I was no better than the furniture they tried to polish until the stain was invisible. I started making sure the house was in perfect order, hoping there wouldn't be anything to set them off. But when ????? caught me trying to clean the house, he cornered me and berated me until I was frightened into silence, accusing me of trying to cover up for ?????'s carelessness. I quickly learned to clean things up when no one was looking.

They had never wanted a child to love and nurture for her own sake. They had wanted a child because they thought, if they were forced to love and nurture a child, they could pretend that was who they really were. They could complete the story they were telling themselves about who they were and what their relationship was. But they could not. And once they could no longer pretend, I was just another burden to them, a failed prop that they had no way to get rid of.

And as they couldn't get rid of me, they put me to any use they could think of.

I was a child. I didn't understand what sex was. But I had heard them. I had listened through the imperfectly soundproofed walls, trying to understand what made them moan, at one moment, "oh gods, I love you, how could I live without you," and at another moment, "[????? you pervert, you freak, only perverts are into that]".

And then there was the day when I walked in on them.

I understand that memories can be altered when we remember them. False memories are a thing that can happen. And the order of events I remember is impossible. But [????? the overall way it happened is something I can be certain about:] They used me as a glorified sex toy. Maybe they were trying to spice up their sex life to forget everything that was wrong with the relationship. And for all their convoluted rules about which kinds of sex were freakish or perverted, literally using a child's body to pleasure themselves was not covered.

Once the idea was in their minds, it could not be removed. Both of them raped me many times. Both together and separately. [?????femalename in particular forced me into many different positions creatively, all the while complaining that it was on the fair because she thought ????? had gotten to use me more than she had.]

I blamed myself for a long time. I no longer do. Those thoughts are not allowed authority in my mind. I thought, "if only I had not given them the idea, by walking in on them that day, none of this would have happened." Yes. Now I can even say it out loud without being afraid I will believe it. This time was easier than last time. That is good.

On other days, they cried and begged me not to tell anyone what they had done. They said it would ruin them. They accused me of tempting them into it. They accused me of despising them for their weakness. Because I was silent. Because I never cried or screamed. Because I had seen them for what they truly were.

And I did what they told me to. I told almost no one. But. I. On one of our visits. Which happened every other week. On one of our visits. I told. My mother. What was happening.

She refused to believe me.

She told me she <em>understood</em> that I wasn't happy with the ?????s. She told me she <em>understood</em> why I would <em>make up a story</em> to try to get her back. But she was the one who was making up a story because the truth was inconvenient for her! ?????

<em>That</em> is when she betrayed me. To keep her grand plan to serve the Waiting God, she could not admit to her mistake, even to save me from years of abuse. I will never forgive her for that. And I will never forgive the Waiting God for accepting her service after that. The Waiting God knows all, but it did nothing to protect me. My suffering was insignificant to it. No matter what it wants or why, no matter how much [????? I seem to follow in its footsteps], I refuse to let it puppeteer my life any longer.

[????? But that is something I can only say from my comfortable position in the future. Back in the past, I had many years of life left to suffer through. They sent me to a private school described in some way.] In those days, I had only one friend, and I treated her very badly. When she left me, it was the worst day of my life. [????? Bit more details and her name]

?????

To keep me busy and quiet, they gave me the best computers and phones that money could buy. But that was their biggest mistake. I spent more and more time in my room, browsing the Internet, learning everything I could. And before long, I found information on child abuse. I learned that what they were doing to me was not normal, and, more importantly, not <em>legal</em>. And that meant that there was something I could do to change it.

I began recording everything they did. Every

?????

[????? Concerns about pregnancy] I became increasingly certain that I needed to make my move.

I didn't know whether I could trust the police. And I didn't know how far the ?????s would go to silence me. I had already left an earlier copy of my records with [????? a friend I thought I could trust], telling her to go to the police with them if I ever disappeared. When I decided to go to the police myself, I went back to her and told her the plans had changed. If I didn't come back, it would mean the police had betrayed me to the ?????s. So I told her that if I didn't come back, she should take my records to the press.



?????

He called me "a perfect witness" and "my little psychopath". He said I would make a good lawyer one day, and I am not sure whether it was a compliment.

?????

[????? They both pled guilty.]

I had succeeded. I should have been happy.

For years, I had kept myself going with the thought that if only I could prove what had happened, she would take me back, Arinyo Seti would take me back. But it was never something that was going to happen. She is Waiting, just as I am. She had made her commitments, and she would not change them for anything. She did not even tell me to my face. She wrote me a letter. It was a letter full of apologies and explanations. She wrote that everything that had been done to me was her own fault. That she did not know if she could ever be forgiven. And that I would be better off living my life far away from her.

Twenty minutes after I read that letter, I cried for the first time in years. I still wanted believe that there was a home I could go back to. I didn't want to believe that she was no more than a [????? flawed/evil] human. I still have that letter, in the drawer of my nightstand. It is the bitterest thing I own.

 ????? I was given into the custody of the Stern. For the next ????? years, I was raised and educated in a Stern monastery.

In a way, it was [????? a relief]. My life had been uprooted in every way, but the Stern gave me stability. The monks kept the same routine every day, ?????. It was a predictability that I had never had before. It gave me a chance to rest and relax, for the first time in my life.

Szaieto, the monk responsible for my upbringing, liked routines as much as I did. We had all our little rituals together. Every morning, he woke me up by tapping the three times on my bedpost. I have actually recorded the sound of that so I can use it as my alarm clock now that I live on my own. And after every meal, we had a hand gesture that we did – I can't really describe it, but I can show you later.

But I was never happy there. For years, I had dedicated my life to a single purpose – escape. But once I had succeeded, I had no idea what to do with my life. I was deeply depressed during my years at the monastery, even if I did not show it on the outside. The monks had answers to a lot of questions, but, but, not that one. There was one other orphan near my age there, but I didn't have anything in common with him.

So, last year, I asked for permission to live independently, and to attend a regular high school. I don't think it was a normal thing to ask for in my situation. But Szaieto and the other monks had been very impressed by how organized and independent I was. They were sad to see me go, but they arranged for me to live in one of the houses the Stern Temple normally reserves for retirees. It's technically rented from the Stern Temple, but it's paid for out of the trust they set up after my parents – after the ?????s were convicted. So… that's why I live there now. The arrangement is, I have a stipend that lets me take care of my basic needs, and the monastery sends someone to visit me once a week to make sure I'm getting along okay.

I guess there's not much more to tell. [????? Some stuff about the school?] [????? Here or above: now I have a mission again so I'm not currently depressed]

<bigbreak>

Yali smiled joylessly. "Can you tell I've told this story before? The parts before ?????, that is. I haven't told anyone since I came to [????? our school]. I wanted to try having a normal school life, just to try it."

Her words kept echoing around my head like it was an empty cave. I felt like there were a million things I wanted to say, but none of them came to me. How? How could people be so horrible? I was supposed to be angry, to hate ????? and ????? and Arinyo Seti for everything they had put her through. But there was an emptiness inside me where the anger should have been.

What could I say? What would Rinn Akatura say? I was supposed to say something, to sympathize, to have an answer to the whole picture of what she told me. But it was a picture of something I couldn't comprehend. My mind stubbornly clung to the tiny details it could make sense of.

"I can't believe your only friend left you…" I said hollowly. "Like, officially <em>left</em> you. On a specific day and everything…"

Yali answered matter-of-factly. "It was 100% my own fault. No child her age could have given me what I needed. I practically bullied her until she was a nervous wreck."

"…<em>you</em> did that? <em>You</em>…?"

"You've only ever seen what I'm like when I'm with <em>you</em>," she said simply.

?????

"How did your mom get picked to be the high priest if she had a bad memory? Isn't remembering the past really important to the Waiting?"

"Ah… she was always forgetting things she did earlier on the same day, but her memory for things that happened <em>twenty years ago</em> was flawless. In the Waiting tradition, people like that are actually considered blessed. It wasn't a blessing for <em>me</em>…" Yali said sourly, but then stopped herself. "But the ?????s did not have memory problems. If my mother's memory problems were the only thing I had to deal with, I would have been happy with that."

"The Broken Gate. It will be, it will be, <em>different</em>."

"Will I stop being… like this?"

"Yes." Yali turned towards me. She put her hands on my shoulders and spoke seriously. "Whatever happens, there's one thing I want you to remember. <em>Nothing</em> that happened in this layer was your fault. Do you understand me?"

"O… kay," I said, uncomprehending.

"You don't believe me," she said.

"I don't believe anything right now."

"I understand. But remember it. In case you need it later."

"Okay."

I faced the portal.

At the thought of stepping in, a terrible loneliness gripped me. I couldn't bear to go away from Yali again. With a desperate craving, I turned and moved in to kiss her.

She gently held me away. "Even if you do that, you don't feel anything. It only makes us both feel worse."

I slumped against her arms.

"I know," she said. "But there's nothing else we can do. Go into the Gate. Things will be better on the other side."

Her strong hands turned me around and guided me towards the portal. My heart cracked and crumpled as my legs carried me into the blackness.

The Broken Gate swallowed me.

The ocean crashed over me. A black ocean, heavy and infinite, tossed and dropped my body across its waves. It washed into my head, flooding away my tiny feelings of fear and despair and want. It washed into my mouth, flooding away my flimsy words of explanation. It washed into my eyes, leaving nothing behind them but the raw force of the cosmos.

I was naked in the biting storm. The world lashed my skin with lines of pain, but I felt no need to strain against it. Every muscle felt its tension drain away, a deep relaxation like sinking into the softest mattress [????? and also peeing? How to make this sound grand?]. I was carried away on a tide of warm and cold. My throat was blocked, yet my chest was full of more breath than my lungs could bear.

?????, like a deep scratch that rubbed over every pore of my skin and drilled down into my very bones. ?????. I was long past telling whether it was a scratch of comfort or of pain. It filled me up, like the roar of water filled my ears. This scratch was everything, everything I could feel or be. Tears poured from me, wrenching at my few remaining scraps of emotion and then draining them into the infinite sea. I was full and empty, awash with agony and bliss. I was everything and nothing. I was the clouds and the desert sand.

[????? Final line?]
