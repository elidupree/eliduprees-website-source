<em>Uuuuuuggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.</em>

It would have been so easy to just go back to sleep again. ?????. But ?????. My arms and legs were full of pins and needles. My mouth felt like it was full of fuzzy cloth. And I needed to pee real bad.

I stubbornly clung onto consciousness.

I tried to sit up. It didn't work very well. I just sort of twitched like a dying fish. Getting up was a huge pain. I wanted to just go back to sleep. But I really did need to get up. I needed to pee. [????? Replace: It was a pretty unfamiliar sensation.

Right, that hadn't happened in a while…

<em>Wait a minute, if I need to pee, does that mean I'm not in the Otherworld anymore?! Where am I?</em>] I decided to ask that out loud, in case Mom or Dad or someone else was listening. "Ooeauuhhh uaaahhhh," I said.

The floorboards creaked as I heard the thump-thump-thump of a heavy shape rushing to my side.

I tried to sit up again. A hand pushed me down. "Shhhhh. Shhhhh. It'll be okay," said a soothing voice.

"Yaaaaaallllllleeeeeeeehhhhhhhh," I moaned with relief.

"Shhhhh. The potion I gave you is still in effect. You're probably not in shape to stand yet. Even if the healing is completely finished, the effects on your soul are, are, are, you might not be fully conscious yet, so your control over your body might not be complete. It's better to relax while…" Yali kept explaining the details for a while, but it all turned to fuzz when it went into my ears.

When she paused for breath, I forced out the words, "Yeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhh, but, I need to <em>peeeeee</em>."

"Oh. I – I could –" she looked around. "Well, if… don't try to move anything too quickly, but, how's your shoulders?"

I slowly tried flexing my shoulders in all directions. It was an effort, and one of my <em>arms</em> flopped around out of my control, but the <em>shoulders</em> didn't seem to have any problems. "Guh azzz new," I slurred.

"That's good. That means the healing has finished like it was supposed to. So, so… just keep being careful… let's see what we can do."

Yali knelt down next to me and pulled my limp arm over her shoulder. Once I locked my arms in place, she slowly stood, carrying most of my weight. I unsteadily stumbled my feet over each other, bouncing randomly against Yali's body as we walked towards the bathroom.

"Where ahhhh we?" I said. It was, like, a regular indoors room, but not one I'd seen before.

"I took us to a hotel. I told them you passed out drunk at an early Unravelling Week celebration and needed a place to stay."

I almost laughed, but it hurt and I sort of choked instead.

"Wait a minute… wait a minute!!! We're back from the Otherworld?? Oh duh, if I need to pee then – wait, how –"

"I'll explain everything in, in a minute," said Yali, in between trying to keep us both balanced on our feet.

Together, we stumbled into the bathroom. In front of the toilet, Yali paused awkwardly. "I can, can, give you your privacy, if, if you think you've got, got, –"

"I mean, you've seen me naked before –"

"Not consensually!" said Yali quickly.

"Oh gods, I'm sorry about that, I totally wasn't thinking about –"

"What?! I meant not consensually for <em>you</em>! You weren't, weren't, weren't in a sound state of mind when I put the Eye on you! And now wouldn't be consensual either, you're clearly under duress because –"

"Whatevaahhh," I said as I dropped my pants. I wriggled out of her arms and collapsed onto the toilet seat. She tried to look away, but immediately had to support me to keep me from falling over.

"Ahhhhh…" I moaned with relief. "I feel like I haven't peed in weeks!"

"Months, actually."

I hurt myself laughing again. It was a pretty comical situation, me letting go on the toilet while Yali was stuck awkwardly holding onto my shoulders to keep me balanced. "This is gonna be a hilarious story someday…" I said.

Yali smiled despite herself. "How very Waiting of you," she said.

<bigbreak>

[????? Summary language of Yali taking care of Rinn for hours or up to a day]

[????? Yali serves Rinn some food]

It looked delicious. "Hang on, what do I eat this with?"

"I think it came with a plastic fork…" Yali fiddled with the packaging.

"Whatever," I said, manifesting a fork-shaped Blood Blade and digging in.

"Is that –" said Yali, astonished.

I held up the fork and we both stared at it.

"Uh…" I said, belatedly realizing what I'd done. "I thought… um… there's no way we're still in the Otherworld, is there?!"

"No…" Yali took the fork and snapped it in half with her fingers. I didn't feel anything through the fork, either. "Manifested matter is weak here, even if you're a god. But, but, you know what this means?!" she said ?????excitedly.

"No, I don't, I'm, like, <em>completely</em> bamboozled."

"It means that when the Blood God rejuvenated, when it took some of your threads – it <em>left the threads for summoning Blood Blades with you.</em> It thinks it doesn't need them anymore!"

"That's… wow." I said. "But, like, what if it <em>does</em> need them? I mean, we won <em>this</em> year, but…"

"Let's, let's, let's talk about that <em>after</em> you've eaten."

"Works for me." I made another fork and ripped into my food. ?????

<bigbreak>

After my stomach settled a bit, we finally got to talking about the Ravelling. Yali carefully explained how she'd tricked me. How I'd been unconscious all the way from the fight to the final portal. How <em>both</em> the Blood God and the Waiting God had rejuvenated. How she had worked to influence the Waiting God to change its mind. I listened and asked a few questions, but it all felt like something that had happened a long time ago, maybe in a previous lifetime.

"You're not… not bothered by this?" she said carefully. "By how I, I, deceived you?"

I shrugged. "I mean, it was pretty smart. We don't know what the Blood God would've done."

"I thought you, you, you, sort of became one with the Blood God."

"I…" I reached out for the part of me that was the Blood God. Nothing happened. "I guess it's gone now. That kinda sucks, I was really starting to enjoy it. But, I mean, it <em>did</em> try to kill you for ages, so… <em>Huh</em>. When I said that, I was, like, subconsciously expecting that it was going to, like, be frustrated in my head. But it really <em>is</em> gone, isn't it?"

"Yeah," said Yali somberly. "Mine's gone, too."

[????? Yali dissatisfied by not knowing how much she influenced the Waiting God]

"I… remember something."

"What is it?"

"From when I was unconscious. I must've been in the portal, because I… I <em>was</em> the god."

[????? Yali looked at me intently]

"I could feel the other gods all around me. Not just the other four gods, but all the gods from all around the world, too. But the five of us, we were all, in… our own, special space. And I was, like… I really wanted to know what the Waiting God was going to feel like. And I, looked, or, not <em>looked</em>, but, you know. And it felt like… something. The Waiting God felt…"

[????? Yali looked at me even more intently. It seemed impossible to put into words. I struggled to put it into words]

"…<em>uncertain</em>."

[????? Yali was frustrated "we will still have to see"]

"[????? How can you be devaluing your accomplishments?] You did more than anyone could have POSSIBLY expected!! You made the <em>Waiting God uncertain?!?</em> Not just any god, but the <em>Waiting God?!?!!</em> That's like… you wrestled with a mountain, and <em>the mountain fell over!</em> And now you're beating yourself up because you couldn't make the mountain beg for mercy! ?????"


?????

"I'm very grateful that you didn't, didn't let me… In the Broken God's world, when I was…"

I was confused for a moment, then realized that she must be referring to when she had sort of come on to me sexually. "Of course!" I said, embarrassed. "I mean, there was obviously something wrong! If I'd have had sex with you in a situation like that, that would make me an asshole!" I didn't mention how close I had felt to just… letting things happen.

"Now, when we eventually do have sex, it can be something beautiful, instead of, instead of, desperate."

"Eventually…" I echoed, a little disappointed.

Her face darkened. "I know what you're thinking. And there's about 40% of me that wants to just throw it all to the Seeking and, and, do it, right now. But…" She paused. "I always knew my trauma wasn't going to go away overnight. I had a plan for it. And if I don't stick to that plan, if I try to have sex before I've dealt with the trauma, it, it, things will happen, that, aren't what I want. That hasn't changed. In fact… when I think about it, I probably have even <em>more</em> trauma than when we started."

"Well, shit…"

"I succeeded. We both got through the Ravelling alive. But there was probably a cost."

"Uh, so, I don't mean to, like, doubt you or anything –"

"Go on, say it."

"You keep saying 'probably'… and you seem pretty calm about all this…"

She smiled ruefully. "I'm okay <em>now</em>, because I'm filling up my mind with taking care of you. But pretty soon, you won't need me for everything, and then… other things are going to come back. You've only <em>known</em> me while I had the Seeing, and the memories. Now that those are gone… I only have my own memories to live with again. I might need… a lot of, of, emotional support, from you, soon… if that's okay…"

"Of course," I breathed.

"Although I'll understand if you have… other duties…"

"Duties? How the fuck am I going to have 'duties'??"

"You know, if you become the new High Priest of Blood."

"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?????!!!!!!"

I was completely blown away. I probably would have literally fallen down if I wasn't already sitting. There were so many things that were impossible about that, I didn't even know where to start. "But I thought – I thought former Ravellers couldn't even <em>be</em> priests!"

Yali smirked. "And <em>I</em> thought Rinn Akatura didn't care about the rules."

"And more importantly, how do you even become a – <em>there isn't even a Blood Temple!!</em>"

"That's just the thing, though, isn't it? The Blood God has rejuvenated. And now some of us here in the material world will need to recreate the Blood Temple. And, I'm not asking you to decide on anything right now, but you… you're the one who knows the Blood God inside and out. The only person alive who does."

?????

<bigbreak>

It wasn't a long time before I got to see [????? what Yali's trauma looked like] for myself.

One morning I woke up early and noticed that she wasn't in bed. She wasn't at her computer, either. I found her sitting on the kitchen floor, leaning her head into the wall and crying.

"Hey, anything I can help with?" I said, trying to sound gentle. She didn't react.

I knelt down next to her and reached out to her. I picked up her hands in mine and gently squeezed. She weakly squeezed back.

"I'm here," I said. "Let's [????? get you somewhere more comfortable?]

She didn't answer. Not sure what to do, I just stayed with her and kept holding her hands. Time passed. I couldn't tell if I was helping. But I loved holding her big soft hands, I could keep sitting here forever. But knowing she was feeling like this was breaking my heart.

Finally, she shifted a little. With a hoarse voice, she choked out a few words.

"She's dead because of me."

I tensed up. "Who in the – wait, you can't mean <em>Justicar??</em> Screw her!"

My words didn't seem to get through. Yali kept muttering into the wall. "If only I just hadn't made you stab me… If only I just hadn't told her…"

"Come on, it was literally 100% her own fault she got killed! You literally gave her a chance to back out when she was in the middle of trying to kill us! Not to mention you <em>literally saved my life, so –</em>"

"Rinn," said Yali heavily.

"Yeah?"

She turned her head halfway towards me. "Can you honestly tell me that she'd still be dead right now if I hadn't told her what happened?"

"You can't think like that! It's not your fault, you didn't do anything wrong!!"

"I'm not… disagreeing with you." Yali took a ragged breath. "But… think about it… can you honestly tell me she'd still be dead right now if I hadn't told her what happened?"

"Stern take it…" I thought about it. "Yeah! I can!" I said aggressively.

"You… can?"

"Yeah, YOU think about it! So let's pretend I don't stab you and we all get to the Broken God's world just fine. What happens then? <em>Morrow</em>! It's not like he went off the rails just because I was screaming for help, he was going to lose control no matter what! And there's no way Justicar wouldn't have heard about it, and then she'd be trying to kill <em>Morrow</em> until one of <em>them</em> was dead. He might have even attacked her first! So unless you'd be happier if Morrow was dead than Justicar, you can just shut right up about blaming yourself, it's hot bullshit!"

Yali stared at me blankly.

"Oh my gods, if you're gonna say you <em>would</em> be happier if Morrow was dead than –"

"It's not… that."

"Then what is –"

Yali waved her hand for me to be quiet.

"Okay, at least [????? let's get you somewhere more comfortable?]"

Yali allowed me to give her a hand up. I was probably completely useless – she was way heavier than I could lift. But she stood up and let me lead her to the couch. Once we'd both sat down, I put my arms around her shoulders and tried to pull her to lean into me, but she just leaned straight back and stared past me into space.

She exhaled, long and shakily. "I shouldn't be dumping this on you… You were there too, you, you, did it just as much as I did…"

"Yeah, but I don't feel guilty about it," I said. It felt a little weird being so casual about it. "I mean, if I killed someone <em>now</em>, I'd probably be pretty freaked out about it. But when I remember it, it's like it's the Blood God's memory more than mine. It doesn't feel like killing somebody, it feels like, I guess… righteously destroying a…"

"Good! Don't think about it too much. Leave the memory how it is."

I blinked. "That's <em>super</em> not what I expected you to say."

"Why not? We can't change what happened. I just don't want you to feel bad about what you had to do."

I gaped at her.

"What? I really don't."

"Are you kidding me!! That's what you say to <em>me</em>, but for <em>yourself</em>, you're all 'it's all my fault' and –"

"I…" Yali took another breath. "I suppose I <em>should</em> learn to take my own advice. I deserve to be happy."

"FUCK YES you do!! You literally fought the gods themselves to keep me safe! You fought an invincible swordswoman with your bare hands –"

"That's enough," she said, smiling slightly.

"– You did SO much for us! I don't know how I would have made it if it wasn't for you! And not just me, even Alchemist –"

"I said, <em>that's enough!</em>" she snarled bitterly.

"What –"

Yali's face scrunched up again, sobbing uncontrollably. Shit! Had I fucked up again?? I squeezed my arms around her shoulders, but she didn't react at all. I felt like I had been locked out. I just hung onto her while she shook, overcome with wave after wave of new tears. When ?????, ?????. When she began sniffling, I offered my sleeve for her to blow her nose in.

Finally, looking down, she blubbered, "How do you know what to say, when, when, when <em>you</em> feel bad? You always have something to say… How do you do it…?"

I wanted to help, but I wasn't sure how. "I mean, I don't know, I just say what comes naturally?"

"Like… what? Just, what's something you might say if you were, if you were…"

"I dunno, I guess if I was upset I'd be like 'I can't stand this, this is all too much'…"

"<em>This is all too much,</em>" whispered Yali. "It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much." She breathed again. "Thank you."

<bigbreak>

Yali sat there for a long time. ????? Slow and heavy breathing. Her tears dried up, but her eyes were still puffy and reddish.

The sun slowly rose, filtering through the blinds. The light made me realize what time it was and how long we'd been just sitting there. I offered to bring Yali some breakfast, but she just patted my hand and got up to get it herself. I followed her as she plodded around the kitchen, gathering up a meal for both of us. I was kinda hungry myself and I wanted to jump ahead, but this was my time to care for Yali. I stayed back and let her go through her process.

When we were done, Yali gathered up the dishes and brought them to the sink to wash. She scrubbed each plate with practiced movements, like she'd done this a million times before.

"You want to know something?" said Yali wistfully.

"Yeah?"

"The whole time I was in the Otherworld, there wasn't a single moment when I felt bad about killing Justicar. She was just, just… someone who was in the way of my goals. So I knew I had to get her out of the way, in whatever way was practical."

"That's…"

"That's the Waiting. It's what the god is, and it's a lot of what I am, too. When I think back to how I made the ?????s suffer, and Morrow… what I remember is, I <em>succeeded</em>. In the end, the only thing that matters is if you accomplished your goal. Your feelings don't matter – unless your feelings are part of the plan, I mean, <em>your</em> feelings mattered because of the whole Blood God thing, and my feelings sometimes mattered because I had to manage them in order to –"

"But your feelings <em>always</em> mat–"

"I know. I know." Yali [????? held up her hands to tell me she gets it and I should be quiet]. "And now… I think I'm a little more Blood. It… it hurts…" She gave a hollow chuckle. "Justicar tried so hard… And also, I… I hate her and I wish I could have made her suffer more before she died… oh, I don't know." She laughed again. "I guess I'm more Broken now, too."


[????? Where in this chapter?:]

[????? Rinn implies something like "we changed the world because of the power of love"]

"I meant what I said to Alchemist. I wasn't just trying to scare them. If you hide from the truth, if you don't have a plan, love will do nothing for you. Our love was very important, it was part of why we succeeded, but it wasn't the only part. We also had a plan for how to take that love and –"

"– and make it have meaning," I finished.

"- and use it to reach the outcome we wanted," finished Yali.

?????

[????? "And like…" [????? Yali physicality] "Love's never going to protect you from an abuser. An abuser might talk about love and niceness, but they'll never stop abusing until they know they have something to lose. When did Morrow say 'I did something wrong'? Only after his powers were gone and he couldn't hurt us anyway. And Justicar in the fifth layer… She ultimately didn't listen to me anyway, but she didn't even <em>start</em> listening until I had physically taken her sword out of her hands.

[????? "You can't help [someone who's hurting people, Morrow] unless you have power over them – maybe Rinn adds this, because it's more Blood]
