<em>Uuuuuuggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.</em>

It would have been so easy to just go back to sleep again. It was so much work to push through the blanket of sleep over me, so easy to let go and let it pull me back. But this was like the seventh time I'd drifted awake, and it was getting more and more uncomfortable every time. My arms and legs were full of pins and needles. My mouth felt like it was full of fuzzy cloth. And I needed to pee real bad.

I stubbornly clung onto consciousness.

I tried to sit up. It didn't work very well. I just sort of twitched like a dying fish. Getting up was a huge pain. I wanted to just go back to sleep. But I really did need to get up. I needed to pee.

This sucked. I <em>never</em> had trouble getting up in the morning! And this wasn't even my familiar bed back at home. Wait a minute, where even was I? I decided to ask that out loud, in case Mom or Dad or someone else was listening. "Ooeauuhhh uaaahhhh," I said.

The floorboards creaked. I heard the thump-thump-thump of a heavy shape rushing to my side.

I tried to sit up again. A heavy hand pushed me down. "Shhhhh. Shhhhh. It'll be okay," said a soothing voice.

"Yaaaaaallllllleeeeeeeehhhhhhhh," I moaned with relief.

"Shhhhh. The potion I gave you is still in effect. You're probably not in good enough shape to stand yet. Even if the healing is completely finished, the effects on your soul are, are, are, you might not be fully conscious yet, so your control over your body might not be complete. It's better to relax while…" Yali kept explaining the details for a while, but it all turned to fuzz when it went into my ears.

When she paused for breath, I forced out the words, "Yeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhh, but, I need to <em>peeeeee</em>."

"Oh. I – I could –" She looked around. "Well, if… don't try to move anything too quickly, but, how's your shoulders?"

I slowly tried flexing my shoulders in all directions. It was an effort, and one of my <em>arms</em> flopped around out of my control, but the <em>shoulders</em> didn't seem to have any problems. "Guh azzz new," I slurred.

"That's good. That means the healing has finished like it was supposed to. So, so… just keep being careful… let's see what we can do."

Yali knelt down next to me and pulled my limp arm over her shoulder. Once I locked my arms in place, she slowly stood, carrying most of my weight. I unsteadily stumbled my feet over each other, bouncing randomly against Yali's body as we walked towards the bathroom.

"Where ahhhh we?" I said. It was, like, a regular indoors room, but not one I'd seen before.

"I took us to a hotel. I told them you passed out drunk at an early Unravelling Week celebration and needed a place to stay."

I almost laughed, but it hurt and I sort of choked instead.

"Wait a minute… wait a minute!!! We're back from the Otherworld?? Oh duh, if I need to pee then – wait, how –"

"I'll explain everything in, in a minute," said Yali, in between trying to keep us both balanced on our feet.

Together, we stumbled into the bathroom. In front of the toilet, Yali paused awkwardly. "I can, can, give you your privacy, if, if you think you've got, got, –"

"I mean, you've seen me naked before –"

"Not consensually!" said Yali quickly.

"Oh gods, I'm sorry about that, I totally wasn't thinking about –"

"What?! I meant not consensually for <em>you</em>! You weren't, weren't, weren't in a sound state of mind when I put the Eye on you! And now wouldn't be consensual either, you're clearly under duress because –"

"Whatevaahhh," I said as I dropped my pants. I wriggled out of her arms and collapsed onto the toilet seat. She tried to look away, but immediately had to support me to keep me from falling over.

"Ahhhhh…" I moaned with relief. "I feel like I haven't peed in weeks!"

"Months, actually."

I hurt myself laughing again. It was a pretty comical situation, me letting go on the toilet while Yali was stuck awkwardly holding onto my shoulders to keep me balanced. "This is gonna be a hilarious story someday…" I said.

Yali smiled despite herself. "How very Waiting of you," she said.

<bigbreak>

[????? Summary language of Yali taking care of Rinn for hours or up to a day]

????? an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. At first, I couldn't figure out what it was. Then I laughed. "Oh my gods, I forgot what it feels like to be hungry!"

"I'll get something for you to eat," said Yali. "And for me, I mean, I took you straight here and I haven't eaten since, so I should probably get something…" She looked around, patting her pockets.

"Do we get room service?" I said.

Yali pulled a fistful of cash out of her pocket.

"Nice," I said.

Yali counted through the bills absentmindedly. "It's not enough for overpriced things like room service, though," she muttered. "I need to make this last until we take a taxi home. They might have frozen my account when I went missing, and if I try to use it, the monks might get notified… I mean, they'll find out I'm back eventually, I just want some time to adjust… Anyway, I know the stores around here. I'll go get something. If you're okay on your own…" Yali examined me again, then checked a few things about magical healing on the internet [???? Check consistent capitalization of Internet]. Eventually, she was satisfied that I wouldn't die if she left me alone for a few minutes. She didn't let me come with her, though. She made me stay at the hotel and rest.

Before long, she got back with some prepackaged meals in a bag. They weren't anything special, but the way I was feeling, they all looked delicious. Yali set them down on the table and started carefully getting one ready. Normally I would have ripped into it as soon as it wasn't frozen, but my head was still a <em>little</em> fuzzy, so I let Yali do with her way, checking it every thirty seconds as it heated up in the microwave.

At long last, she set it down in front of me.

"Hang on, what do I eat this with?" I said.

"I think it came with a plastic fork…" Yali fiddled with the packaging.

"Whatever," I said, manifesting a fork-shaped Blood Blade and digging in.

"Is that –" said Yali, astonished.

I held up the fork and we both stared at it.

"Uh…" I said, belatedly realizing what I'd done. "I thought… um… there's no way we're still in the Otherworld, is there?!"

"No…" Yali took the fork and snapped it in half with her fingers. I didn't feel anything through the fork, either. "Manifested matter is weak here, even if you're a god. But, but, you know what this means?!" she said loudly.

"No, I don't, I'm, like, <em>completely</em> bamboozled."

"It means that when the Blood God rejuvenated, when it took some of your threads – it <em>left the threads for summoning Blood Blades with you.</em> It thinks it doesn't need them anymore!"

"That's… wow." I said. "But, like, what if it <em>does</em> need them? I mean, did we really stop the…"

"Let's, let's, let's talk about that <em>after</em> you've eaten."

"Works for me." I made another fork and ripped into my food. ????

<bigbreak>

After my stomach settled a bit, we finally got to talking about the Ravelling. Yali carefully explained how she'd tricked me. How I'd been unconscious all the way from the fight to the final portal. How <em>both</em> the Blood God and the Waiting God had rejuvenated. How she had worked to influence the Waiting God to change its mind. I listened and asked a few questions, but it all felt like something that had happened a long time ago, maybe in a previous lifetime.

"You're not… not bothered by this?" she said carefully. "By how I, how I, deceived you?"

I shrugged. "I mean, it was pretty smart. We don't know what the Blood God would've done."

"I thought you, you, you, sort of became one with the Blood God."

"I…" I reached out for the part of me that was the Blood God. Nothing happened. "I guess it's gone now. That kinda sucks, I was really starting to enjoy it. But, I mean, it <em>did</em> try to kill you for ages, so… <em>Huh</em>. When I said that, I was, like, subconsciously expecting that it was going to, like, be frustrated in my head. But it really <em>is</em> gone, isn't it?"

"Yeah," said Yali somberly. "Mine's gone, too."

"That's, uh, that's good, right?"

Yali hesitated. "It should be. I should be happy that we both got out alive and now I can live my life without the Waiting God looking over my shoulder, any more than it always does for everybody."

"But…?"

Yali's eyes moved slowly, staring at the table. "I just wish I knew if it worked. If, if, the Waiting God is even thinking anything different, because of what I did. But I guess we won't really know until next year's Ravelling. I don't remember anything after I went into the final portal and the god started taking me apart."

????

A thought drifted into my head. It was only half-formed, but I felt like I should say it. "I… remember something," I said.

"What is it?"

"From when I was unconscious. I must've been in the portal, because I… I <em>was</em> the god."

Yali looked at me intently.

"I could feel the other gods all around me. Not just the other four gods, but all the gods from all around the world, too. But the five of us, we were all, in… our own, special space. And I was, like… I really wanted to know what the Waiting God was going to feel like. And I, looked, or, not <em>looked</em>, but, you know. And it felt like… something. The Waiting God felt…"

Yali leaned forward, her eyes drilling into me like she was hanging on every word I said. That made me kinda nervous, because I wasn't that confident about what I remembered. It was all hazy and unreal. But Yali needed me to do this. I struggled to put the memory into words.

"It felt… <em>uncertain</em>," I finished.

Yali slumped a little. "I guess I shouldn't have hoped for something clearer…"

"Are you kidding me?!"

"What? You can't just say 'Are you kidding me?' all the time, I literally don't know what you're –"

"How can you just sit there like you didn't just do the most amazing thing anyone's ever done?! You made the <em>Waiting God uncertain?!?</em> Not just any god, but the <em>Waiting God?!?!!</em> That's like… you wrestled with a mountain, and <em>the mountain fell over!</em> And now you're beating yourself up because you couldn't make the mountain beg for mercy! That's – that's like – "

"I just don't know if it was enough."

"It was more than anyone could <em>possibly</em> have expected!"

"That doesn't mean it was enough." Yali stood at the window and stared out, looking over the Waiting Temple and all the old-fashioned buildings arrayed around it. "What people expect from you, and what's enough… they're nothing close to each other. What's the best that people expect from a kid who's being abused by their parents? Maybe to tell a trusted adult?" She grinned viciously.

"Oh gods."

"I'm sure some of the people out there still hate me because I spoiled their fun, because they can't go to the ????s' parties anymore. They all just want to pretend that everything is fine. Like if you just go to school and do what you're supposed to, and then get a job and do what you're supposed to, and maybe give to charity a little, then you've done enough, and everything will be fine. But it's not fine. It won't be fine. And they don't even want to <em>imagine</em> what it would take to fix everything. So if I don't do it, no one else will do it for me. So no, I can't afford to say I've done enough just because I did something no one else did. If I'm the only one doing it, I have to do it perfectly, because if <em>I</em> make a mistake, there won't be a second chance to get it right."

"That's dark," I said.

"That's the truth. And you can say you don't like the truth, you can try to change it, but you can't just –" Yali took a breath, then slowly exhaled, turning back from away the window towards me. "Sorry. I don't need to lecture <em>you</em> about this. <em>You</em> get it. Whenever <em>you</em> see a problem, you're like, 'I'm going to put a stop to this right now, and I don't care what anyone else thinks'."

"Fuck yeah," I said. It came out a little weaker than I intended it. Guess I still wasn't recovered all the way yet.

Yali padded over and sat down next to me. Somberly, she said, "If there's one thing the Waiting God was right about, it's that humanity needs to change. But maybe, with people like you and me… [????? Maybe the world will be better someday – callback to the caretaker]"

I held her hand, intertwining my fingers with hers. "?????. Think about it, we already changed the world once! [????? Description of their actions in terms of loving/caring for each other] It'll be, like, 'here comes Yalkatura – changing the world with the power of love!'"

Yali smiled. "I like how optimistic you are. But I think we might need a different slogan."

"What's wrong with the power of love? I figured you'd like that better than [????? 'shut up or we'll kick your ass'] –"

Yali smirked. "[????? 'Shut up or we'll kick your ass'] does have a certain appeal… But no. I just wouldn't want to imply that love is everything, or even the majority, of what gave us the power to stand against the gods. I meant what I said to Alchemist, I wasn't just trying to scare them. If you hide from the truth, if you don't have a plan, love will do nothing for you. Our love was very important, it was part of why we succeeded, but it wasn't the only part. We also had a plan for how to take that love and –"

"– and make it have meaning," I finished.

"- and use it to make sure we got the outcome we wanted," finished Yali. She gave me a sidelong look. "I guess you said it the Blood way."

?????

[????? "And like…" [????? Yali physicality] "Love is never going to protect you from an abuser. An abuser might talk about love, they might talk about trying to be a better person, but they'll never stop abusing until they know they have something to lose. When did Morrow say 'I did something wrong'? Only after his powers were gone and he couldn't hurt us anyway. And Justicar in the fifth layer… She ultimately didn't listen to me anyway, but she didn't even <em>start</em> listening until I had physically taken her sword out of her hands.

[????? "You can't help [someone who's hurting people, Morrow] unless you have power over them – maybe Rinn adds this, because it's more Blood]
<bigbreak>

[????? more summary language until they take a taxi home]

I flung open the door, then ran and flopped on the couch. I leaned back luxuriantly, pressing my neck into the soft cushions. "Ahhhhh… I've sure missed hanging out in the best house in the world."

Yali closed the door quietly behind her. "What makes this the best –"

"Because <em>you</em> live here, obviously. C'mere."

Yali lowered herself onto the couch next to me. She leaned in, putting her big arms around me. I basked in her warmth, closing my eyes as she ruffled my hair. Before long, I felt her gently nuzzling into me, slowly kissing the side of my neck. I let myself melt away into an endless, relaxed comfort. We had been through so much together. And now, we were home again. [????? See below] [????? plant seeds of "the monks will visit" and "returning to family/school"]

Time passed. After a while, Yali lay back, too. We both stared dreamily up at the ceiling together, with Yali softly holding my hands in hers.

"So, this is a small thing…" Yali said quietly, stroking my hand. "But, I'm very grateful that you didn't, didn't let me… In the Broken God's world, when I was…"

I was confused for a moment, then realized that she must be referring to when she had sort of come on to me sexually. "Of course!" I said, embarrassed. "I mean, there was obviously something wrong! If I'd have had sex with you in a situation like that, that would make me an asshole!" I didn't mention how close I had felt to just… letting things happen.

"Now, when we eventually do have sex, it can be something beautiful, instead of, instead of, desperate."

"Eventually…" I echoed, a little disappointed.

Her face darkened. "I know what you're thinking. And there's about 40% of me that wants to just throw it all to the Seeking and, and, do it, right now. But…" She paused. "I always knew my trauma wasn't going to go away overnight. I had a plan for it. And if I don't stick to that plan, if I try to have sex before I've dealt with the trauma, it, it, things will happen, that, aren't what I want. That hasn't changed. In fact… when I think about it, I probably have even <em>more</em> trauma than when we started."

"Well, shit…"

"I succeeded. We both got through the Ravelling alive. But there was probably a cost."

"Uh, so, I don't mean to, like, doubt you or anything –"

"Go on, say it."

"You keep saying 'probably'… and you seem pretty calm about all this…"

She smiled ruefully. "I'm okay <em>now</em>, because I'm filling up my mind with taking care of you. But pretty soon, you won't need me for everything, and then… other things are going to come back. You've only <em>known</em> me while I had the Seeing, and the memories. Now that those are gone… I only have my own memories to live with again. I might need… a lot of, of, emotional support, from you, soon… if that's okay…"

"Of course," I breathed.

"Although I'll understand if you have… other duties…"

"Duties? How the fuck am I going to have 'duties'??"

"You know, if you become the new High Priest of Blood."

"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT???!?!?!!!!"

I was completely blown away. I probably would have literally fallen down if I wasn't already sitting. There were so many things that were impossible about that, I didn't even know where to start. "But I thought – I thought former Ravellers couldn't even <em>be</em> priests!"

Yali smirked. "And <em>I</em> thought Rinn Akatura didn't care about the rules."

"Wh– Wha– And more importantly, how do you even become a – <em>there isn't even a Blood Temple!!</em>"

"That's just the thing, though, isn't it? The Blood God has rejuvenated. And now some of us here in the material world will need to recreate the Blood Temple. And, I'm not asking you to decide on anything right now, but you… you're the one who knows the Blood God inside and out. The only person alive who does."

"You're actually serious. Oh gods, you're actually serious."

"I am," she said.

"Oh gods," I said, putting a hand to my forehead. "I know I was talking about changing the world, but… okay, it sounds awesome, but… gods, I need a nap. I need to take a nap for, like, a whole month, before I can even think about temple stuff."

"That's fine. In fact… that's a relief, actually," said Yali.

"Wait, how is it a relief to <em>you</em>?"

Yali smiled wistfully. "Yeah, I've got all these notes… stuff I learned about the old Blood Temple when I was still in the Otherworld, stuff that might be useful if we ever want to build a new one. And I'm not sure if <em>I</em> want to look at those notes anytime this month, either. I mean, other than to email them to myself so I have a backup. And I already did that while you were still unconscious. Yeah. ?????

?????

[????? Maybe: I pulled Yali back towards me, and [????? she indulged] [squishing me into the couch]. So many things in the future, but for now, we could just forget all that. And maybe move "we had been through so much together" down here?]

<bigbreak>

It wasn't a long time before I got to see [????? what Yali's trauma looked like] for myself.

One morning I woke up early and noticed that she wasn't in bed. [????? Establish that they started sleeping in the same bed] She wasn't at her computer, either. I found her sitting on the kitchen floor, leaning her head into the wall and crying.

"Hey, anything I can help with?" I said, trying to sound gentle. She didn't react.

I knelt down next to her and reached out to her. I picked up her hands in mine and gently squeezed. She weakly squeezed back.

"I'm here," I said. "Come on, let's go somewhere more comfortable?"

She didn't answer. Not sure what to do, I just stayed with her and kept holding her hands. Time passed. I couldn't tell if I was helping. But I loved holding her big soft hands, I could keep sitting here forever. But knowing she was feeling like this was breaking my heart.

Finally, she shifted a little. With a hoarse voice, she choked out a few words.

"She's dead because of me."

I tensed up. "Who in the – wait, you can't mean <em>Justicar??</em> Screw her!"

My words didn't seem to get through. Yali kept muttering into the wall. "If only I just hadn't made you stab me… If only I just hadn't told her…"

"Come on, it was literally 100% her own fault she got killed! You literally gave her a chance to back out when she was in the middle of trying to kill us! Not to mention you <em>literally saved my life, so –</em>"

"Rinn," said Yali heavily.

"Yeah?"

She turned her head halfway towards me. "Can you honestly tell me that she'd still be dead right now if I hadn't told her what happened?"

"You can't think like that! It's not your fault, you didn't do anything wrong!!"

"I'm not… disagreeing with you." Yali took a ragged breath. "But… think about it… can you honestly tell me she'd still be dead right now if I hadn't told her what happened?"

"Stern take it…" I thought about it. "Yeah! I can!" I said aggressively.

"You… can?"

"Yeah, YOU think about it! So let's pretend I don't stab you and we all get to the Broken God's world just fine. What happens then? <em>Morrow</em>! It's not like he went off the rails just because I was screaming for help, he was going to lose control no matter what! And there's no way Justicar wouldn't have heard about it, and then she'd be trying to kill <em>Morrow</em> until one of <em>them</em> was dead. He might have even attacked her first! So unless you'd be happier if Morrow was dead than Justicar, you can just shut right up about blaming yourself, it's hot bullshit!"

Yali stared at me blankly.

"Oh my gods, if you're gonna say you <em>would</em> be happier if Morrow was dead than –"

"It's not… that."

"Then what is –"

Yali waved her hand for me to be quiet.

"Okay, at least let's go somewhere more comfortable?"

Yali allowed me to give her a hand up. I was probably completely useless – she was way heavier than I could lift. But she stood up and let me lead her to the couch. Once we'd both sat down, I put my arms around her shoulders and tried to pull her to lean into me, but she just leaned straight back and stared past me into space.

She exhaled, long and shakily. "I shouldn't be dumping this on you… You were there too, you, you, did it just as much as I did…"

"Yeah, but I don't feel guilty about it," I said. It felt a little weird being so casual about it. "I mean, if I killed someone <em>now</em>, I'd probably be pretty freaked out about it. But when I remember it, it's like it's the Blood God's memory more than mine. It doesn't feel like killing somebody, it feels like, I guess… righteously destroying a…"

"Good! Don't think about it too much. Leave the memory how it is."

I blinked. "That's <em>super</em> not what I expected you to say."

"Why not? We can't change what happened. I just don't want you to feel bad about what you had to do."

I gaped at her.

"What? I really don't."

"Are you kidding me!! That's what you say to <em>me</em>, but for <em>yourself</em>, you're all 'it's all my fault' and –"

"I…" Yali took another breath. "I suppose I <em>should</em> learn to take my own advice. I deserve to be happy."

"FUCK YES you do!! You literally fought the gods themselves to keep me safe! You fought an invincible swordswoman with your bare hands –"

"That's enough," she said, smiling slightly.

"– You did SO much for us! I don't know how I would have made it if it wasn't for you! And not just me, even Alchemist –"

"I said, <em>that's enough!</em>" she snarled bitterly.

"What –"

Yali's face scrunched up again, sobbing uncontrollably. Shit! Had I fucked up again?? I squeezed my arms around her shoulders, but she didn't react at all. I felt like I had been locked out. I just hung onto her while she shook, overcome with wave after wave of new tears. When she tried to sit up and lost her balance, I let her brace herself on my arm. When she started sniffling, I offered my sleeve for her to blow her nose in.

Finally, looking down, she blubbered, "How do you know what to say, when, when, when <em>you</em> feel bad? You always have something to say… How do you do it…?"

I wanted to help, but I wasn't sure how. "I mean, I don't know, I just say what comes naturally?"

"Like… what? Just, what's something you might say if you were, if you were…"

"I dunno, I guess if I was upset I'd be like 'I can't stand this, this is all too much'…"

"<em>This is all too much,</em>" whispered Yali. "It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much. It's too much." She breathed again. "Thank you."

<bigbreak>

Yali sat there for a long time. I kept cuddling up to her, feeling her slow and heavy breathing through my body. Her tears dried up, but her eyes were still puffy and reddish.

The sun slowly rose, filtering through the blinds. The light made me realize what time it was and how long we'd been just sitting there. I offered to bring Yali some breakfast, but she just patted my hand and got up to get it herself. I followed her as she plodded around the kitchen, gathering up a meal for both of us. I was kinda hungry myself and I wanted to jump ahead, but this was the time for me to take care of Yali. I stayed back and let her go through her process.

When we were done, Yali gathered up the dishes and brought them to the sink to wash. She scrubbed each plate with practiced movements, like she'd done this a million times before.

"You want to know something?" said Yali wistfully.

"Yeah?"

"The whole time I was in the Otherworld, there wasn't a single moment when I felt bad about killing Justicar. She was just, just… someone who was in the way of my goals. So I knew I had to get her out of the way, in whatever way was practical."

"That's…"

"That's the Waiting. It's what the god is, and it's a lot of what I am, too. When I think back to how I made the ????s suffer, and Morrow… what I remember is, I <em>succeeded</em>. In the end, the only thing that matters is if you accomplished your goal. Your feelings don't matter – unless your feelings are part of the plan, I mean, <em>your</em> feelings mattered because of the whole Blood God thing, and my feelings sometimes mattered because I had to manage them in order to –"

"But your feelings <em>always</em> mat–"

"I know. I know." Yali waved for me to be quiet. "And now… I think I'm a little more Blood. It… it hurts…" She gave a hollow chuckle. "Justicar tried so hard… And also, I… I hate her and I wish I could have made her suffer more before she died… oh, I don't know." She laughed again. "I guess I'm more Broken now, too."
