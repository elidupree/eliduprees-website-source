Two bodies lay before me. One dead, one only unconscious, both my doing. One Justicar. One Rinn.

Was it over?

I listened for the future. There was the heavy hum of Alchemist's presence. The deadened coil of Morrow's anguish. And the strong, reassuring pulse of Rinn's heartbeat. I followed its thread down every branch, into every corner of the future, letting no tiny offshoot escape my notice. But everywhere I looked, the heartbeat continued. All the paths led unerringly to the final portal.

It was –

If I said it was over, I would sit down, and I wouldn't get up again for a long time. But there were many things I still needed to do.

First, I would have to look at Rinn. There would still be injuries on her body. But logically, I knew that she was not in pain, and that the injuries would not be permanent. The healing potion I had given her would see to that. So there was no need for me to feel anxious about what I saw.

I looked.

Unspeakable feelings pressed in at the edges of my mind. If I kept looking at this mutilation, I wouldn't be able to stay in control. I would strike Justicar in anger, even though she was already dead. And the tradition was clear: Anyone who defiles a corpse will be cursed for life. I was not sure if the curse was literal, but this would not be a good time to risk being cursed, not after everything we had just survived. So I looked away.

I took a minute to pack away the unwanted thoughts. Then I tried again, looking at Rinn the way a doctor might, seeing only the practical facts and not my tangled feelings about them.

The left arm and left leg were positioned at angles that wouldn't be possible if the bones were intact. Most likely, they had been reduced to powder by Justicar's first attack. Before they could heal properly, I would have to move them to a more natural position. Meanwhile, beneath the body, the right shoulder was also crushed, torn and bloody.

?????

In the first aid videos I had seen, they said that you were supposed to put an unconscious person on their side, to make sure they could breathe properly. Did that apply to this situation? If I put Rinn on her side, it would put a lot of weight on one of her shoulders. And <em>both</em> of her shoulders had been crushed. They were being magically healed, but I didn't know if it was possible for them to heal into a deformed position. I checked the future, but the healing process wouldn't be complete until after we returned to the material world, so I couldn't see far enough to be sure.

Could I put her in a different position?

Also, how would I transport her? One way or another, she would have to arrive at the final portal. She was light enough that I could carry her, but if I slipped or jostled her along the way, it could reinjure her.

?????

[????? Once Rinn is relatively stable, Looking at Rinn's face,] There was a peaceful half-smile on her face. She looked so cozy, nestled in the foam blocks. It made me want to ruffle her hair, to cup her cheek in my hand. But if I did those things, I would want more, and then more. It would lead to things I shouldn't do when she was unconscious, even if she wasn't injured. So if I started down that path, I would have to spend my concentration on calming myself down, just as much as I did when I thought about Justicar or Morrow. It was easier if I didn't think about any of it.

Now there was nothing more I could do for Rinn immediately. Maybe now I would have time to think and plan my next move.

Should I find a place to sit? It would not be possible for me to relax, not so soon after Rinn had been in danger. And even if I could, it would make me suffer. As much as I had improved my endurance, I could already feel my muscles burning from the strain of combat. For now, the feeling was kept at a distance, but if I relaxed, it would catch up with me.

I compromised by manifesting a hard bench and sitting up straight on it. That called back a memory of Szaieto chiding me that it wasn't good for me to be so tense. It was funny to think of such an ordinary thing at a time like this. I allowed myself to be amused, but only for a moment. I had plans to make.

<bigbreak>

I had never intended to take the unravelling potion.

When I had foreseen Alchemist approaching with idea of the potion, I had tried many different futures. I had tried to convince Rinn of my true plan. But the Blood God refused to hear of anything that would allow the Waiting God to rejuvenate. And provoking the Blood God now wasn't something I was willing to risk. I might have been able to convince it if at least <em>Rinn</em> had been on my side. But this wasn't something that Rinn could truly understand either. To her, a fight was simple. You beat up the enemy, and then you won. So if the Blood God rejuvenated and the Waiting God did not, it would be a complete success. A total victory for the Blood God.

To me, that wasn't enough.

The Waiting God had <em>allowed</em> its Farseers to die. It had callously sacrificed them, for no more reason than to prove its story that the Blood God was a monster. Rinn's words echoed in my head: <em>I will kill you and kill you and kill you, and when I am gone, you will still be strong.</em> And the Waiting God knew it. The Waiting saw the grand span of time. The loss of a single rejuvenation, in a single year, was nothing to it. And so that loss was nothing to me as well. I was not content to take away only what it had already willingly discarded.

What I needed was a way to access the Waiting God directly, [so that I could leave a <em>permanent</em> scar ????? so that the [wounds I dealt to it] would be <em>permanent</em>.].

What I needed… were the threads it had woven into my soul.

And so, here we were. Everything was going according to plan. Justicar was no longer a threat. Rinn… Well, that was one of the things it would be easier not to think about. Working with Alchemist, I had learned that the most powerful healing potions also leave the drinker unconscious, sometimes for days at a time. And when Rinn wasn't with us, I had asked them to heighten that effect even further, just in case. I had sincerely hoped that Rinn wouldn't have to be injured. If she hadn't been, I would have used the Seeing again, to search again for ways the Blood God could be convinced. But this way, at least, everything was simpler. Now Rinn was no longer a threat, no matter what I chose to do. Neither she nor the Blood God inside her would wake until we had already entered the final portal.

Now only my most powerful enemy was left.

<bigbreak>

How was I going to do this?

 [???? Yali planning to confront the Waiting]

I remembered how Rinn had talked when she was speaking for the Blood God. She hadn't said "Rinn" and "the Blood God". She had said "me" and "me". If I wanted to influence the Waiting, it wouldn't work to think about it as attacking an external enemy. I would have to treat it as if I was trying to change part of <em>myself</em>.

I smiled grimly.

Keeping still and silent, I listened for the Waiting God's presence. The part of me that I listened for when I used the Seeing. The reassuring pillar of inevitability. The watchful presence that knew the past and future, that would grant me the knowledge to guide the world to [????? the best possible outcome].

It was time to cast doubt on all that. I thought it over, doubting each part in turn. Its reassurance had no foundation. The knowledge it offered was misleading. Its vision for the world was wrong.

With each new thought, the presence felt weaker. This wasn't working. By denying it directly, I was only distancing myself from it. To really influence it, I would have to <em>synchronize</em> with the god. I would have to go deep into its thoughts, even if that meant feeling like I believed them.

But, even if I knew what it felt like to listen to the Waiting God… what did it feel like to <em>be</em> the Waiting God?

I did not know, but I <em>knew</em>. The Waiting God did not feel the reassurance of inevitability. The Waiting God <em>was</em> inevitability. To be the Waiting God <em>was</em> to watch and wait. To plan. To know. The Waiting God did not obtain knowledge. It <em>reviewed</em> knowledge. Past and future were already united within its soul.

So… I waited.

The knowledge I wanted would come to me. In fact, it was already here. It would simply rise to our attention when the time was right. As we had already done innumerable times throughout the span of years, we would review our plan. Our plan for the Blood God. For the temples. For our city.

?????.

The city stretched across the centuries, from its cloudy origins as a struggling cluster of huts, to the compromise of the five walls around its current city center on the hill, to the unified metropolis it could one day become.

?????

Three other forces struggled to guide the city, each with their own shortsighted fragments of wisdom.

The Stern were a foundation. Flawed, at times unnecessarily cruel, but a foundation. Where humanity would not accept our gentle guidance to the proper path, Stern would ensure that the way was not lost. And where the Stern reached to excess, they could be tempered, guided into a more efficient shape.

The Seeking were a source of inspiration, pointing the way to undiscovered futures. Ever impetuous, they reached out for disaster in equal measure to delight. Yet they had no power to achieve disaster without a loan of the others' strength. Their strength could be regulated, their ingenuity turned to the benefit of all.

But Blood…

Blood refused guidance. Unlike the Seeking, they did not merely flare up and die down.

?????

Once there was no more Blood, the city could flourish unhindered.

[????? Favorable description of the Waiting God's vision of a world without the Blood God]

THIS WAS SO WRONG. HOW COULD I NOT HAVE SEEN IT? HOW? <EM>HOW?!</EM>

The thoughts came from nowhere, disrupting our focus. Was there something urgent we had missed? We smoothly put aside our thoughts of the plan –

NO! YOU – I – OUR PLAN <EM>WAS</EM> THE MISTAKE! ALL THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING! WE DIDN'T DESERVE TO GET TO STOP THINKING OF IT! SHE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, SHE WAS SUFFERING! HOW HAD I NOT SEEN IT?! <EM>HOW?!</EM>

Terror pressed in from the base of our mind. A crushing feeling gripped our chest. This made no sense! This was our plan, our plan! Nothing had changed! How could it be wrong?! How was Blood a "she"?! How – something was wrong, what was happening –

I was Yali again, my body shaken away from the god by a violent force. It was agony, pushing myself back upright and trying to control the painful tears. My mind was in chaos. I'd thought I was being clever, using my own feeling of guilt, but it had gotten mixed up with my guilt about [????? childhood friend] – no, it HAD been clever! It had <em>worked!</em> The Waiting God was shaken too, I had felt it! A feeling of triumph rose inside me. And this was only the beginning! I gathered my determination. I listened for the Waiting again, and felt…

Nothing but fatigue.

After a moment, I understood. It was like the way I had felt back in the material world, when I had forced myself to use the Seeing for as long as I could. My connection to the Waiting God had been overtaxed. Well… if it was like before, it would recover after a time. It would not be soon, but I would have many more chances to confront the god. Still, this was troublesome. There were multiple things I would have to consider. How might the Waiting God's thoughts change while I was unable to access them? Would ????? ????? [????? concern about lack of access to the Seeing] [????? what about the memories? Are they also inaccessible?] [????? possibility of the main confrontation happening in the final portal]

<bigbreak>

For now, there was nothing more I could do with the Waiting God.

I forced myself to my feet. I had sat for a long time, thinking and planning, but my thoughts had begun to stray. If I tried to keep at it much longer, I would begin to think of things that were not necessary, things that would only distract me with worries. It was time to take Rinn and begin moving.

But first… there was Justicar's body to consider.

If I left Justicar's body now, there would be no one left to say the prayer for the dead. A brief and spiteful thought told me that I could simply leave her to rot. But the satisfaction would be short-lived, and I would likely have guilt and doubt about that decision for much longer. It was better to say a prayer. It would bring closure to this tragedy.

But which prayer should I say? Every god had its own prayer for the dead. I knew all the Waiting prayers by heart, but it seemed cruel to say a Waiting prayer, when it was the Waiting God which had created the situation that caused her death. The Stern prayer was what she would want, but the Stern prayer also said "[????? may your sacrifice be successful]". I would not be able to say that sincerely. And in the eyes of the gods, an insincere prayer was the same as no prayer at all.

Could I say a Blood prayer?

To be true to the Blood God, I would have to say the prayer with true emotion. But if I felt the emotions that my body wanted me to feel, I wouldn't be able to keep doing what I needed to do.

In the end, I settled with the Broken. [????? The Broken prayer] 

?????

I walked.

Next to the vast structures of this world, I felt very small. Walking past just one building took multiple minutes. I felt suspended in time, slowly trudging away, wheeling Rinn along with me, the pulsing sun continuously burning away. I couldn't look straight ahead without getting it in my eyes. So I looked down. I had no sense of what was coming. The buildings and flagstones went past me one after another, without any plan or sense of order.

The road heaved sharply uphill, twisting at an angle that made it hard to walk, as if a mountain had begun rising under the city with no regard to what was built there. I trudged past a collapsed tower, even its fallen stones taller than I was. I trudged past a massive spike of metal reaching up at an angle into the sky, like a giant's spear stabbed up through the ground from below. And everywhere, the braided cables of steel, [????? very large], that Rinn called the muscles of the city.

My road ended at the entrance to a massive open-air forge. [????? Very large] mechanical bellows sat motionless, looming nearby broad anvils layered with the dust of years. Enormous crucibles stood against the sky, with channels where molten metal might have poured down from them. The whole place was piled with every kind of tool and device imaginable, the floor barely visible under them. I could just imagine Rinn digging through the piles, pulling out random devices and doing irresponsible things with them. I smiled despite myself.

But to me, this was all so much trash. The tools might represent something with a purpose, if you looked across all of history. But right now, they were just things in my way. How would I cart Rinn past the forge without a flat floor to roll my wagon along?

If <em>Rinn</em> was awake, she would probably manifest a giant bridge going all the way over everything, like she had before. Maybe even I would be able to do that, if my "heart was ready". But that wasn't something I could think about now.

Could a clear the piles away? Could I go around? Could I manifest a sort of boardwalk over them?

The boardwalk would not work. The piles were unsteady. They might shift under us, and then Rinn could be reinjured. And going around… even if I could find a way to go around, it probably wouldn't be allowed. This was the Blood God's world. I remembered Rinn saying that we wouldn't get closer to the heart unless we used our own bodies. In the same way, going <em>around</em> a problem just wasn't the Blood way of doing things.

I sat a while and thought of how I could move the things. No good ideas came to me. Eventually, I stood up and began hauling them out of the way one at a time, making a path just wide enough for me and my wagon. It was heavy work. Each thing seem to be tangled with a dozen others. Pain accumulated in my back.

Many of the tools were already rusted out, and fell apart as I tried to pull them away.


[????? Yali becomes physically tired of moving up in, and stopped to rest]

It was time to move forward with my <em>other</em> plan.

If I was going to spend time studying the past, I would need to get comfortable. I manifested my familiar reclining chair and sat down. I wasn't comfortable at first. An old wound bothered me. I shifted my position until it was more tolerable. My leg was cramped. I reclined the chair just right to let it relax. My legs itched where they had gotten warm from walking. I concentrated until the itch subsided.

Finally, my body stopped interrupting my thoughts.

The sun was glaring in my eyes. I had chosen an indoor spot to rest, but the sun shone through a window, and the reflection on the far wall was too bright. I manifested a folding divider wall between me and the reflection, but somehow, even the ambient light in the room was glaring in my eyes. I manifested a sleep mask to completely shut out the light. That didn't help either. Belatedly, I realized what was really happening. It wasn't the physical light that was bothering me. It was the Blood God's presence. I wouldn't be able to shut <em>that</em> out. And given what I was about to do, I wouldn't even want to. It would be better if I could be aware of it, even if it was a strain. So I unmanifested the mask and wall. Instead of shutting out the bright light, I stared into it. I waited until every part of me stopped seeing it as a source of pain, and started seeing it as a point of reference.

And then, I began my task. I began to dig up the memories.


If I wanted to know more about the Blood Temple, I would have to search among my memories for what I might know and what I didn't. I attempted to think back to any memories related to the Blood Temple. None appeared. That seemed impossible. Surely, many of the former Farseers had lived in a time when the Blood Temple was still active. Did I have memories from those years? I did. Did I have memories from Farseers who lived in the fifth layer of the city? I did. The main Blood Temple building would have been at the main square of the fifth layer. I had seen a picture of it, in an old book I had found in a back room of the Stern monastery. Could I picture a memory of that temple?

Slowly, an image formed into place. The wide front door, with the Burning Heart emblazoned at the top of its arch. Echoes of the deep pounding of its drums on its festival days. Flickering images of crowds gathered in celebration or rage.

The Waiting God was resisting me. It had hidden the truth for as long as it could, and it would not simply give up now. But it was not in its nature to lie, either. It had shown me a misleading story of the past, and it had lied by omission about the future. But it had never shown me a false vision, and it would not refuse to show me a memory once I asked a specific question.

I kept digging. Many of the Farseers had only known of the blood Temple from a distance. A few were more promising. There was a lawyer who had argued cases in the Blood courts. [????? Other examples]

I decided to investigate the lawyer first. The first thing I felt was his frustration and contempt for the Blood legal system. [????? Shouldn't there be examples of specific memories here?] In Stern court, you only needed to prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that a defendant had violated the law. I – the lawyer – had done that many times. There were many restrictions on the arguments you could make and the evidence you could present, to prevent unjust convictions, but if you studied the law, as I had, you could rely on them to obey consistent rules.

Not so much with Blood court. In Blood court, it wasn't enough for me to prove a violation of the <em>law</em> – I needed a violation of someone's <em>blood</em>. That was irritatingly vague and inconsistent. Obviously, it didn't only mean people's literal blood. Literal blood was the highest standard – any case of assault where the victim was bruised or their skin was broken would automatically count. And property crimes would <em>sometimes</em> count, because it was still considered a <em>violation of blood</em> if the victim experienced fear or insecurity as a result of the crime. But if you tried to get someone convicted for theft or vandalism of a storefront, even if they were the most contemptible repeat offender? Ha! You might as well try to convince a fish that it was wet.

I was sick of being assigned to cases in the fifth layer. Now, I was proud of my work – someone <em>else</em> in my position might give up, but I would never abandon a case that I could still win. Not infrequently, [????? I found a way to argue that part of the crime had happened in the fourth layer, which was officially shared between the Blood and Stern temples.]. If that was so, the case would have to be reviewed by the ????? – the body that governed what to do with crimes that crossed between the jurisdiction of multiple temples.
 ?????
 
I took a lot of notes on my phone, too. I wasn't sure if I was going to keep any of the former Farseers' memories after I was brought back to the material world. I would <em>probably</em> still have my own memories of <em>remembering</em> the other memories, but I preferred not to rely on that if I didn't have to.


?????

I would probably have liked Alchemist a lot better if I hadn't had to do so much work to stop them from getting themself killed. I might even have liked Morrow better if the Seeking God hadn't pointed the worst part of him directly at the one I loved. But the past cannot be changed.
