Two bodies lay before me. One dead, one only unconscious. One Justicar. One Rinn.

Was it over?

I listened for the future. There was [????? details of the other ravellers]. [????? Something about the strong pulse of rinn's heartbeat in every corner of the future, reaching to the final portal].

It was –

If I said it was over, I would sit down, and I wouldn't get up again for a long time. But there were many things I still needed to do.

First, I would have to look at Rinn. There would still be injuries on her body. But logically, I knew that she was not in pain, and that the injuries would not be permanent. The healing potion I had given her would see to that. So there was no need for me to feel anxious about what I saw.

I looked.

Unspeakable feelings pressed in at the edges of my mind. If I kept looking at this mutilation, I wouldn't be able to stay in control. I would strike Justicar in anger, even though she was already dead. And the tradition was clear: Anyone who defiles a corpse will be cursed for life. I was not sure if the curse was literal, but this would not be a good time to risk being cursed, not after everything we had just survived. So I looked away.

I took a minute to store away the unwanted thoughts. Then I tried again, looking at Rinn the way a doctor might, seeing only the practical facts and not my tangled feelings about them.



?????

In the first aid videos I had seen, they said that you were supposed to put an unconscious person on their side, to make sure they could breathe properly. Did that apply to this situation? If I put Rinn on her side, it would put a lot of weight on one of her shoulders. And <em>both</em> of her shoulders had been crushed. They were being magically healed, but I didn't know if it was possible for them to heal into a deformed position. I checked the future, but the healing process wouldn't be complete until after we returned to the material world, so I couldn't see far enough to be sure.

Could I put her in a different position?

Also, how would I transport her? One way or another, she would have to arrive at the final portal. She was light enough that I could carry her, but if I slipped or jostled her along the way, it could reinjure her.

[????? Once Rinn is relatively stable, Looking at Rinn's face,] There was a peaceful half-smile on her face. She looked so cozy, nestled in the foam blocks. It made me want to ruffle her hair, to cup her cheek in my hand. But if I did those things, I would want more, and then more. It would lead to things I shouldn't do when she was unconscious, even if she wasn't injured. So if I started down that path, I would have to spend my concentration on calming myself down, just as much as I did when I thought about Justicar or Morrow. It was easier if I didn't think about any of it.

?????

If I left Justicar's body now, there would be no one left to say the prayer for the dead. [???? this was moved up, replace?] According to tradition, anyone who left a body un[?????honored] would be cursed for life. I was not sure if the curse was literal, but this would not be a good time to risk being cursed, not after everything we had just survived. But which prayer should I say? Every god had its own prayer for the dead. I knew all the Waiting prayers by heart, but [????? it seemed offensive] to say a Waiting prayer when it was the Waiting God who had created the situation that caused her death. The Stern prayer was what she would want, but the Stern prayer also said "[????? may your sacrifice be successful]". I would not be able to say that sincerely. And in the eyes of the gods, an insincere prayer was the same as no prayer at all.

Could I say a Blood prayer?

To be true to the Blood God, I would have to say the prayer with true emotion. But if I felt the emotions that my body wanted me to feel, I wouldn't be able to keep doing what I needed to do.

In the end, I settled with the Broken. [????? The Broken prayer]

?????

[????? Yali becomes physically tired of moving up in, and stopped to rest]

It was time to move forward with my <em>other</em> plan.

If I was going to spend time studying the past, I would need to get comfortable. I manifested my familiar reclining chair and sat down. I wasn't comfortable right away. An old wound bothered me, so I shifted my position until it was more tolerable. My leg was cramped. I reclined the chair just right to let it relax. My legs itched where they had gotten warm from walking. I concentrated until the itch subsided.

Finally, my body stopped interrupting my thoughts.

The sun was glaring in my eyes. I had chosen an indoor spot to rest, but the sun shone through a window, and the reflection on the far wall was too bright. I manifested a folding divider wall between me and the reflection, but somehow, even the ambient light in the room was glaring in my eyes. I manifested a sleep mask to completely shut out the light. That didn't help either. Belatedly, I realized what was really happening. It wasn't the physical light that was bothering me. It was the Blood God's presence. I wouldn't be able to shut <em>that</em> out. And given what I was about to do, I wouldn't even want to. It would be better if I could be aware of it, even if it was a strain. So I unmanifested the mask and wall. Instead of shutting out the bright light, I stared into it. I waited until every part of me stopped seeing it as a source of pain, and started seeing it as a point of reference.

And then, I began my task. I began to dig up the memories.


If I wanted to know more about the Blood Temple, I would have to search among my memories for what I might know and what I didn't. I attempted to think back to any memories related to the Blood Temple. None appeared. That seemed impossible. Surely, many of the former Farseers had lived in a time when the Blood Temple was still active. Did I have memories from those years? I did. Did I have memories from Farseers who lived in the fifth layer of the city? I did. The main Blood Temple building would have been at the main square of the fifth layer. I had seen a picture of it, in an old book I had found in a back room of the Stern monastery. Could I picture a memory of that temple?

Slowly, an image formed into place. The wide front door, with the Burning Heart emblazoned at the top of its arch. Echoes of the deep pounding of its drums on its festival days. Flickering images of crowds gathered in celebration or rage.

The Waiting God was resisting me. It had hidden the truth for as long as it could, and it would not simply give up now. But it was not in its nature to lie, either. It had shown me a misleading story of the past, and it had lied by omission about the future. But it had never shown me a false vision, and it would not refuse to show me a memory once I asked a specific question.

I kept digging. Many of the Farseers had only known of the blood Temple from a distance. A few were more promising. There was a lawyer who had argued cases in the Blood courts. [????? Other examples]

I decided to investigate the lawyer first. The first thing I felt was his frustration and contempt for the Blood legal system. [????? Shouldn't there be examples of specific memories here?] In Stern court, you only needed to prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that a defendant had violated the law. I – the lawyer – had done that many times. There were many restrictions on the arguments you could make and the evidence you could present, to prevent unjust convictions, but if you studied the law, as I had, you could rely on them to obey consistent rules.

Not so much with Blood court. In Blood court, it wasn't enough for me to prove a violation of the <em>law</em> – I needed a violation of someone's <em>blood</em>. That was irritatingly vague and inconsistent. Obviously, it didn't only mean people's literal blood. Literal blood was the highest standard – any case of assault where the victim was bruised or their skin was broken would automatically count. And property crimes would <em>sometimes</em> count, because it was still considered a <em>violation of blood</em> if the victim experienced fear or insecurity as a result of the crime. But if you tried to get someone convicted for theft or vandalism of a storefront, even if they were the most contemptible repeat offender? Ha! You might as well try to convince a fish that it was wet.

I was sick of being assigned to cases in the fifth layer. Now, I was proud of my work – someone <em>else</em> in my position might give up, but I would never abandon a case that I could still win. Not infrequently, [????? I found a way to argue that part of the crime had happened in the fourth layer, which was officially shared between the Blood and Stern temples.]. If that was so, the case would have to be reviewed by the ????? – the body that governed what to do with crimes that crossed between the jurisdiction of multiple temples.
 ?????

[???? Yali planning to confront the Waiting]

I remembered how Rinn had talked when she was ????? the Blood God. She hadn't said "Rinn" and "the Blood God" – she had said "me" and "me".

?????

I would probably have liked Alchemist a lot better if I hadn't had to do so much work to stop them from getting themself killed. I might even have liked Morrow better if the Seeking God hadn't pointed the worst part of him directly at the one I loved. But the past cannot be changed.
