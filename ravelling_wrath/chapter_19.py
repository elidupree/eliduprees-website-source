Two bodies lay before me. One dead, one only unconscious, both my doing. One Justicar. One Rinn.

Was it over?

I listened for the future. There was the heavy hum of Alchemist's presence. The deadened coil of Morrow's anguish. And the strong, reassuring pulse of Rinn's heartbeat. I followed its thread down every branch, into every corner of the future, letting no tiny offshoot escape my notice. But everywhere I looked, the heartbeat continued. All the paths led unerringly to the final portal.

It was –

If I said it was over, I would sit down, and I wouldn't get up again for a long time. But there were many things I still needed to do.

First, I would have to look at Rinn. There would still be injuries on her body. But logically, I knew that she was not in pain, and that the injuries would not be permanent. The healing potion I had given her would see to that. So there was no need for me to feel anxious about what I saw.

I looked.

Unspeakable feelings pressed in at the edges of my mind. If I kept looking at this mutilation, I wouldn't be able to stay in control. I would strike Justicar in anger, even though she was already dead. And the tradition was clear: Anyone who defiles a corpse will be cursed for life. I was not sure if the curse was literal, but this would not be a good time to risk being cursed, not after everything we had just survived. So I looked away.

I took a minute to pack away the unwanted thoughts. Then I tried again, looking at Rinn's body the way a doctor might, seeing only the practical facts and not my tangled feelings about them.

The left arm and left leg were positioned at angles that wouldn't be possible if the bones were intact. Most likely, they had been reduced to powder by Justicar's first attack. Before they could heal properly, I would have to move them to a more natural position. Meanwhile, beneath the body, the right shoulder was also crushed, torn and bloody. Again, I would have to reposition it.

How would I go about this? What position could I put them in?

In the first aid videos I had seen, they said that you were supposed to put an unconscious person on their side, to make sure they could breathe properly. Did that apply to this situation? If I put the body on its side, it would put a lot of weight on one of the shoulders. And <em>both</em> of the shoulders had been crushed. They were being magically healed, but I didn't know what would happen if they tried to heal while they were still in a deformed position. I checked the future, but the healing process wouldn't be complete until after we returned to the material world, so I couldn't see far enough to be sure.

Could I put her in a different position?

Also, how would I transport her? One way or another, she would have to arrive at the final portal. She was light enough that I could carry her, but if I slipped or jostled her along the way, it could reinjure her. It would be better if I found a way to move her while keeping her stable, with padding.

I considered this for a while. At last, I settled on an idea. Concentrating, I manifested the same rolling hospital bed that we had used in the Stern God's layer. By itself, this wouldn't be suitable for the current layer's cracked and slanted roads, but it was a start. Next, I changed its wheels. Using manifesting, I reshaped them to have big, soft rubber tires, to soften the bumps. Also, relying on one of the old Farseers' memories, I added ratchets to the wheels, so the bed wouldn't roll back down a hill if I lost my grip on it. After a lot of reshaping, I ended up with a sort of bulky wagon with a mattress on top.

The next thing was to put Rinn on it. I didn't want to hurt her more by trying to lift her directly. So I manifested an inflatable cushion under her body, and slowly inflated it, to lift her up a little at a time. With careful manifesting, I was able to lift her whole body evenly. Once it was up alongside the mattress on the wagon, I manifested another mat under her so I could slide her across.

By the same process, I lifted her into a sitting position in the wagon. To make sure she wouldn't fall, I surrounded her body with stiff foam blocks. I shaped each block around her, so her whole body was nestled in a perfect mold. Once I got the shape right, I made the blocks merge together, and also merged to them into the mattress underneath, so there was one, solid object holding Rinn in place, and it couldn't slip or fall apart.

I stepped back and checked my work. It seemed suitable. Rinn was secure now, with only her head sticking out of the foam. There was a peaceful half-smile on her face. She looked so cozy, nestled in the foam. It made me want to ruffle her hair, to cup her cheek in my hand. But if I did those things, I would want more, and then more. It would lead to things I shouldn't do when she was unconscious, even if she wasn't injured. So if I started down that path, I would have to spend my concentration on calming myself down, just as much as I did when I thought about Justicar or Morrow. It was easier if I didn't think about any of it.

Now there was nothing more I could do for Rinn immediately. Maybe now I would have time to think and plan my next move.

Should I find a place to sit? It would not be possible for me to relax, not so soon after Rinn had been in danger. And even if I could, it would put me in pain. As much as I had improved my endurance, I could already feel my muscles burning from the strain of combat. For now, the feeling was kept at a distance, but if I relaxed, it would catch up with me.

I compromised by manifesting a hard bench and sitting up straight on it. That called back a memory of Szaieto chiding me that it wasn't good for me to be so tense. It was funny to think of such an ordinary thing at a time like this. I allowed myself to be amused, but only for a moment. I had plans to make.

<bigbreak>

I had never intended to take the unravelling potion.

When I had foreseen Alchemist approaching with idea of the potion, I had tried many different futures. I had tried to convince Rinn of my true plan. But the Blood God refused to hear of anything that would allow the Waiting God to rejuvenate. And to provoke the Blood God now wasn't something I was willing to risk. I might have been able to convince it if at least <em>Rinn</em> had been on my side. But this wasn't something that Rinn could truly understand either. To her, a fight was simple. You beat up the enemy, and then you won. So if the Blood God rejuvenated and the Waiting God did not, it would be a complete success. A total victory for the Blood God.

To me, that wasn't enough.

The Waiting God had <em>allowed</em> its Farseers to die. It had callously sacrificed them, for no more reason than to prove its story that the Blood God was a monster. Rinn's words echoed in my head: <em>I will kill you and kill you and kill you, and when I am gone, you will still be strong.</em> And the Waiting God knew it. The Waiting saw the grand span of time. The loss of a single rejuvenation, in a single year, was insignificant to it. And so that loss was insignificant to me as well. I was not content to take away only what it had already willingly discarded.

What I needed was a way to access the Waiting God directly, [so that I could leave a <em>permanent</em> scar ????? so that the [wounds I dealt to it] would be <em>permanent</em>.].

What I needed… were the threads it had woven into my soul.

And so, here we were. Everything was going according to plan. Justicar was no longer a threat. Rinn… Well, that was one of the things it would be easier not to think about. Working with Alchemist, I had learned that the most powerful healing potions also leave the drinker unconscious, sometimes for days at a time. And when Rinn wasn't with us, I had asked Alchemist to heighten that effect even further, just in case. I had sincerely hoped that Rinn wouldn't have to be injured. If she hadn't been, I would have used the Seeing again, to search again for ways the Blood God could be convinced. But this way, at least, everything was simpler. Now Rinn was no longer a threat, no matter what I chose to do. Neither she nor the Blood God inside her would wake until we had already entered the final portal.

Now only my most powerful enemy was left.

<bigbreak>

How was I going to do this?



 [???? Yali planning to confront the Waiting]

I remembered how Rinn had talked when she was speaking for the Blood God. She hadn't said "Rinn" and "the Blood God". She had said "me" and "me". If I wanted to influence the Waiting, it wouldn't work to think about it as attacking an external enemy. I would have to treat it as if I was trying to change part of <em>myself</em>.

I smiled grimly.

Keeping still and silent, I listened for the Waiting God's presence – the part of me that I listened for when I used the Seeing. The reassuring pillar of inevitability. The watchful presence that knew the past and future, that would grant me the knowledge to guide the world to [????? the best possible outcome].

It was time to cast doubt on all that. I thought it over, doubting each part in turn. Its reassurance had no foundation. The knowledge it offered was misleading. Its vision for the world was wrong.

With each new thought, the presence felt weaker. This was too easy. It couldn't possibly be this easy to influence the god, so I had to assume I wasn't influencing it. After a little more thinking, I realized what was really happening. By denying the god directly, I was only distancing myself from it. To really influence it, I would have to <em>synchronize</em> with the god. I would have to go deep into its thoughts, even if that meant feeling like I believed them.

To do that, I would have to feel like the Waiting God. But how would I do this? Until now, I had only known what it felt like to listen to the Waiting God. What did it feel like to <em>be</em> the god?

I did not know, but I <em>knew</em>. The Waiting God did not feel the reassurance of inevitability. The Waiting God <em>was</em> inevitability. To be the Waiting God <em>was</em> to watch and wait. To plan. To know. The Waiting God did not obtain knowledge. It <em>reviewed</em> knowledge. Past and future were already united within its soul.

So… I waited. The knowledge I wanted would come to me. In fact, it was already here.

I closed my eyes. I reached out for the Seeing, then allowed my mind to drift. Threads of past and future floated past me, ghosts of other worlds that could have been. In the darkness of my closed eyes, I could still see the Blood God's city around me. Only I could see it even more clearly than before. I saw the buildings and towers from every side at once. I saw the foundations and the insides of the walls. From every brick and beam, more threads trailed off, leading back to the Ravellers, from whose imagination they had formed. The mimicry was so simple, so bold. It was easy to see how Blood had made this. It had chosen these images of ruination, even now, when it had only just begun to weaken. Perhaps it understood what was coming. Yes… it could see the shape of things. This was one of its few virtues. Yet how unfortunate that it could not see as we did.

Blood…

It could not see the truth of our city.

[????? Possibly cut, maybe move: It would simply rise to our attention when the time was right. As we had already done innumerable times throughout the span of years, we would review our plan. Our plan for the Blood God. For the temples. For our city.]


The city stretched across the centuries, from its cloudy origins as a struggling cluster of huts, to the compromise of the five walls around its present-day center on the hill, to the unified metropolis it could one day become. We who rested in every foundation, we who stood watch over every lintel, had guided this city, quietly pointing the way to its potential. The city did not always ?????, it did not always follow where we landed, but we showed it to the shape of what it could be coming, and it would always return to that shape in the end.


Within our oversight, three other forces struggled to guide the city, each with their own shortsighted fragments of wisdom.

The Stern were a foundation. Flawed, yes; at times unnecessarily cruel, yes; but a foundation. Where humanity would not accept our gentle guidance to the proper path, the Stern would ensure that the way was not lost. And where the Stern reached to excess, they could be tempered, guided into a more efficient shape.

The Seeking were a source of inspiration, pointing the way to undiscovered futures. Ever impetuous, they reached out for disaster in equal measure to delight. Yet they had no power to achieve disaster without a loan of another's strength. The strength available to them could be regulated, their ingenuity turned to the benefit of all.

But Blood…

Blood refused guidance. Unlike the Seeking, they did not merely flare up and die down. Once they had latched onto a design, they refused to let go, even if it went against all that was right. Across history, a trail stood out, a trail of instances when our careful dreaming had unveiled a route the city could take for the benefit of all, only for Blood to reject it. With the others, we could adapt. When the Stern denied a plan of ours, we could find an imperfect alternative – one that would be palatable to the Stern, yet serve the same overall purpose. But with Blood, it was as if they could see into our process, and spitefully reject every alternative design we unearthed, even if it was a design that Blood would otherwise accept.

????? [????? Look for inspiration in Blood as the unconscious mind rejecting choices that aren't in your human-selfish interest]

Thus, the city was limited, only able to develop in ways that could navigate around Blood's ?????limitations.

?????

Once there was no more Blood, the city could flourish unhindered.



?????

[????? Favorable description of the Waiting God's vision of a world without the Blood God]

THIS WAS SO WRONG. HOW COULD I NOT HAVE SEEN IT? HOW? <EM>HOW?!</EM>

The thoughts came from nowhere, disrupting our focus. Was there something urgent we had missed? We smoothly put aside our thoughts of the plan –

NO! YOU – I – OUR PLAN <EM>WAS</EM> THE MISTAKE! ALL THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING! WE DIDN'T DESERVE TO GET TO STOP THINKING OF IT! SHE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, SHE WAS SUFFERING! HOW HAD I NOT SEEN IT?! <EM>HOW?!</EM>

Terrible uncertainty crept into the base of our mind. Our human chest had filled with a crushing feeling. This made no sense! To doubt the plan of centuries was incoherent. Yet the thought had appeared. Why had we thought the plan was wrong? Why… why had we thought of Blood as "she"? How – something was very wrong, we needed to review our –

I was Yali again, my body shaken away from the god by a violent force. It was agony, pushing myself back upright and trying to control the painful tears. My mind was in chaos. I'd thought I was being clever, using my own feeling of guilt, but it had gotten mixed up with my guilt about [????? childhood friend] – no, it HAD been clever! It had <em>worked!</em> The Waiting God was shaken too, I had felt it! A feeling of triumph rose inside me. And this was only the beginning! I gathered my determination. I listened for the Waiting again, and felt…

Nothing but fatigue.

After several minutes, I understood. It was like the way I had felt back in the material world, when I had forced myself to use the Seeing for as long as I could. My connection to the Waiting God had been overtaxed. Well… if it was like before, it would recover after a time. It would not be soon, but I would have many more chances to confront the god.

Still, this was troublesome. There were multiple things I would have to consider. How might the Waiting God's thoughts change while I was unable to access them? Would ????? ????? [????? concern about lack of access to the Seeing] [????? what about the memories? Are they also inaccessible?] [????? possibility of the main confrontation happening in the final portal]

<bigbreak>

For now, there was nothing more I could do with the Waiting God.

I forced myself to my feet. I had sat for a long time, thinking and planning, but my thoughts had begun to stray. If I tried to keep at it much longer, I would begin to think of things that were not necessary, things that would only distract me with worries. It was time to take Rinn and begin moving.

But first… there was Justicar's body to consider.

If I left Justicar's body now, there would be no one left to say the prayer for the dead. A brief and spiteful thought told me that I could simply leave her to rot. But the satisfaction would be short-lived, and I would likely have guilt and doubt about that decision for much longer. It was better to say a prayer. It would bring closure to this tragedy.

But which prayer should I say? Every god had its own prayer for the dead. I knew all the Waiting prayers by heart, but it seemed cruel to say a Waiting prayer, when it was the Waiting God which had created the situation that caused her death. The Stern prayer was what she would want, but the Stern prayer also said "[????? may your sacrifice be successful]". I would not be able to say that sincerely. And in the eyes of the gods, an insincere prayer was the same as no prayer at all.

Could I say a Blood prayer?

To be true to the Blood God, I would have to say the prayer with true emotion. But if I felt the emotions that my body wanted me to feel, I wouldn't be able to keep doing what I needed to do.

In the end, I settled with the Broken. [????? The Broken prayer] 

?????

I walked.

Next to the vast structures of this world, I felt very small. Walking past just one building took multiple minutes. I felt suspended in time, slowly trudging away, wheeling Rinn along with me, the pulsing sun continuously burning away. I couldn't look straight ahead without getting it in my eyes. So I looked down. I had no sense of what was coming. The buildings and flagstones went past me one after another, without any plan or sense of order.

The road heaved sharply uphill, twisting at an angle that made it hard to walk, as if a mountain had begun rising under the city with no regard to what was built there. I trudged past a collapsed tower, even its fallen stones taller than I was. I trudged past a massive spike of metal reaching up at an angle into the sky, like a giant's spear stabbed up through the ground from below. And everywhere, the braided cables of steel, [????? very large], that Rinn called the muscles of the city.

My road ended at the entrance to a massive open-air forge. [????? Very large] mechanical bellows sat motionless, looming nearby broad anvils layered with the dust of years. Enormous crucibles stood against the sky, with channels where molten metal might have poured down from them. The whole place was piled with every kind of tool and device imaginable, the floor barely visible under them. I could just imagine Rinn digging through the piles, pulling out random devices and doing irresponsible things with them. I smiled despite myself.

But to me, this was all so much trash. The tools might represent something with a purpose, if you looked across all of history. But right now, they were just things in my way. How would I cart Rinn past the forge without a flat floor to roll my wagon along?

If <em>Rinn</em> was awake, she would probably manifest a giant bridge going all the way over everything, like she had before. Maybe even I would be able to do that, if my "heart was ready". But that wasn't something I could think about now.

Could a clear the piles away? Could I go around? Could I manifest a sort of boardwalk over them?

The boardwalk would not work. The piles were unsteady. They might shift under us, and then Rinn could be reinjured. And going around… even if I could find a way to go around, it probably wouldn't be allowed. This was the Blood God's world. I remembered Rinn saying that we wouldn't get closer to the heart unless we used our own bodies. In the same way, going <em>around</em> a problem just wasn't the Blood way of doing things.

I sat a while and thought of how I could move the things. No good ideas came to me. Eventually, I stood up and began hauling them out of the way one at a time, making a path just wide enough for me and my wagon. It was heavy work. Each thing seem to be tangled with a dozen others. Pain accumulated in my back.

Many of the tools were already rusted out, and fell apart as I tried to pull them away. This left debris in my path, which I would have to clear away. If I bent down to lift every fragment, it would soon become too much for me.


[????? Yali becomes physically tired of moving up in, and stopped to rest]

It was time to move forward with my <em>other</em> plan.

If I was going to spend time studying the past, I would need to get comfortable. I manifested my familiar reclining chair and sat down. I wasn't comfortable at first. An old wound bothered me. I shifted my position until it was more tolerable. My leg was cramped. I reclined the chair just right to let it relax. My legs itched where they had gotten warm from walking. I concentrated until the itch subsided.

Finally, my body stopped interrupting my thoughts.

The sun was glaring in my eyes. I had chosen an indoor spot to rest, but the sun shone through a window, and the reflection on the far wall was too bright. I manifested a folding divider wall between me and the reflection, but somehow, even the ambient light in the room was glaring in my eyes. I manifested a sleep mask to completely shut out the light. That didn't help either. Belatedly, I realized what was really happening. It wasn't the physical light that was bothering me. It was the Blood God's presence. I wouldn't be able to shut <em>that</em> out. And given what I was about to do, I wouldn't even want to. It would be better if I could be aware of it, even if it was a strain. So I unmanifested the mask and wall. Instead of shutting out the bright light, I stared into it. I waited until every part of me stopped seeing it as a source of pain, and started seeing it as a point of reference.

And then, I began my task. I began to dig up the memories.


If I wanted to know more about the Blood Temple, I would have to search among my memories for what I might know and what I didn't. I attempted to think back to any memories related to the Blood Temple. None appeared. That seemed impossible. Surely, many of the former Farseers had lived in a time when the Blood Temple was still active. Did I have memories from those years? I did. Did I have memories from Farseers who lived in the fifth layer of the city? I did. The main Blood Temple building would have been at the main square of the fifth layer. I had seen a picture of it, in an old book I had found in a back room of the Stern monastery. Could I picture a memory of that temple?

Slowly, an image formed into place. The wide front door, with the Burning Heart emblazoned at the top of its arch. Echoes of the deep pounding of its drums on its festival days. Flickering images of crowds gathered in celebration or rage.

The Waiting God was resisting me. It had hidden the truth for as long as it could, and it would not simply give up now. But it was not in its nature to lie, either. It had shown me a misleading story of the past, and it had lied by omission about the future. But it had never shown me a false vision, and it would not refuse to show me a memory once I asked a specific question.

I kept digging. Many of the Farseers had only known of the blood Temple from a distance. A few were more promising. There was a lawyer who had argued cases in the Blood courts. [????? Other examples]

I decided to investigate the lawyer first. The first thing I felt was his frustration and contempt for the Blood legal system. [????? Shouldn't there be examples of specific memories here?] In Stern court, you only needed to prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that a defendant had violated the law. I – the lawyer – had done that many times. There were many restrictions on the arguments you could make and the evidence you could present, to prevent unjust convictions, but if you studied the law, as I had, you could rely on them to obey consistent rules.

Not so much with Blood court. In Blood court, it wasn't enough for me to prove a violation of the <em>law</em> – I needed a violation of someone's <em>blood</em>. That was irritatingly vague and inconsistent. Obviously, it didn't only mean people's literal blood. Literal blood was the highest standard – any case of assault where the victim was bruised or their skin was broken would automatically count. And property crimes would <em>sometimes</em> count, because it was still considered a <em>violation of blood</em> if the victim experienced fear or insecurity as a result of the crime. But if you tried to get someone convicted for theft or vandalism of a storefront, even if they were the most contemptible repeat offender? Ha! You might as well try to convince a fish that it was wet.

I was sick of being assigned to cases in the fifth layer. Now, I was proud of my work – someone <em>else</em> in my position might give up, but I would never abandon a case that I could still win. Not infrequently, [????? I found a way to argue that part of the crime had happened in the fourth layer, which was officially shared between the Blood and Stern temples.]. If that was so, the case would have to be reviewed by the ????? – the body that governed what to do with crimes that crossed between the jurisdiction of multiple temples.
 ?????
 
I took a lot of notes on my phone, too. I wasn't sure if I was going to keep any of the former Farseers' memories after I was brought back to the material world. I would <em>probably</em> still have my own memories of <em>remembering</em> the other memories, but I preferred not to rely on that if I didn't have to.

?????

<bigbreak>

I had spent enough time in memories. My body was rested again. I forced myself to my feet and began to walk again.

Most of the journey was not difficult. I only had to endure the soreness of my legs, from the walking, and my arm, from hauling Rinn in the wagon, and my eyes, from the constant glare that I couldn't block even with a visor. It was all unimportant. What mattered was reaching the black dot in the distance, the final portal.

[????? Yali comes to a huge crevice in the ground]

This was a problem. I had to keep going towards the portal, but I couldn't think of a way across the crevice. It was too wide for me to manifest a bridge across it. The edges were too steep for me to cart Rinn down one side and up the other.

?????

Could I manifest a hot air balloon? No… even if I could do that, I wouldn't know how to land it without jostling Rinn. Besides, Rinn had said that we wouldn't "get closer to the heart" unless we moved using our own bodies. Would it count as using my own body if I used my arms to operate an engine that carried me…? How did Rinn even know what counted and what didn't? If she was awake, she'd probably say it was obvious, like you could feel it with your body or something.

It wasn't obvious to <em>me</em>.

?????

I would have to figure out how to do the large-scale manifesting Rinn and Justicar had been doing.

I stood and held out my arms, copying the way Rinn usually stood to manifest. How did she do it? What kind of feelings did she draw on when she was making that golden bridge? She was probably just completely confident. She could probably unleash the full power of her soul, without trying at all. The problem was, that wasn't me.

I had to try.

In my mind, I visualized a bridge in front of me, a steel structure that word span all the way across the crevice. Then I focused my will on making it real. Like before, it flickered into existence, but then flickered out again. I stayed calm and focused, trying to make it stable. But it was too weak. I pushed with my mind, but it failed to become real.

I stared at the crevice for many minutes, trying each variation I thought of. First I tried to push harder with my mind. When that didn't work, I tried to push more gently. I tried to build the bridge a little at a time, but it got harder and harder the more I added. I ended up with something that didn't even reach a quarter of the way across. I was clearly missing something. When Rinn had done it, it felt like she wasn't trying at all. So I tried not trying at all, just waving my hand and expecting the bridge to appear for me. Again, nothing happened.

A shred of impatience broke out of me.

The instant it did, the bridge was real. The instant I got myself under control again, it was gone.

I tried to do it again, allowing the impatience to come forward. I glared at the crevice, forcing the bridge to appear again. It did, if unsteadily. Now all I had to do was to stabilize it, to find a way to sustain the impatient feeling long enough to finish the bridge, but not to lose control –

When I looked, the bridge was gone again. Even with the impatience still at the forefront of my mind, the bridge had disappeared the moment I felt like I could regulate it.

So that was how it was.

I should have known. This was the Blood God's world. It would want us to unleash our feelings, not to regulate them. ?????

?????

I had many choices of which feelings to unleash. It probably wasn't correct to use the impatience. It wasn't an especially strong feeling, which probably made it "not my true feelings" to the Blood God, or something like that. My true feelings were… well, there was the pain, but I wasn't sure how I would make a bridge with that. I needed something that was intense, but also strong, capable of –

I <em>definitely</em> had one of those. It was already rising to my mind. I had been trying not to use this one so often, but if the Blood God was going to force me, it had only itself to blame. I could already feel my heart thudding, a foul feeling in my mouth and throat.

It would be so easy, so satisfying, to let the feeling take over. For the moment, I held it back. It would probably be a good idea to put Rinn at a safe distance. Concentrating, I rolled her wagon far away from the edge. Then I walked back alone, to stand at the edge of the crevice, glaring at the city. Did it want me to unleash my feelings? Fine, then. I <em>would</em>.

A bridge. I <em>could</em> make a bridge. But why should I just adapt to the world when <em>it</em> had never adapted to <em>me</em>? I raised my arm like a claw. I would show the Blood God what would happen if you tried to control Yali Seti. I reached out my will and tore into the ground on the other side of the crevice. Under the force of my manifesting, concrete cracked and collapsed, buildings crumbled, and the waste slowly slid and fell into the hole. What had Rinn said? "Every human is the equal of the entire world"? How misguided. I was <em>better</em> than this world. Rinn and I were the only things that mattered. Everything else here, from this despicable crevice standing in my way, to the crumbling temple buildings that had never done me any good anyway, was worthless. They didn't <em>deserve</em> for me to <em>allow</em> them to remain standing.

I felt a pressure pushing back at me. I could tell what <em>that</em> meant. The Blood God didn't <em>like</em> me calling the world worthless. But I didn't care what it liked. I pushed past its resistance, toppling building after building into the pit. <em>You tried to kill me, you put the one I love through so much pain, and now you <strong>dare</strong> tell me how to feel? We may have a truce, but you have no right to speak to me.</em>

[????? Yali finishes filling the crevice with waste, then flattens it into a road and walks across, eventually cooling down and expressing a more balanced view of the Blood God. In particular, she realizes that if she wants the Waiting God to feel guilt and to change, she has to make that be part of herself, and so making "change in how I feel about the Blood God" is as important as it is problematic]

I had resented the Blood God. I had seen it as getting in my way, interfering with me. My hands began shaking as I realized it. That was how the Waiting God felt. I would never be able to change the Waiting God if my own soul [????? had a tendency to] confirm its [????? prejudices].

There was a great pain behind my eyes. I didn't want this. I had been justified. Every part of my dislike for the Blood God was fully justified. But it didn't matter how justified I was. If I kept fighting against it, the fighting would be part of me. And then the Waiting God would absorb that part of me. And then it would continue the cycle that had nearly killed us both.

If I wanted to win, I would have to do the opposite. Somehow, somehow, I would have to, to <em>value</em> the Blood God's perspective.

I would have to accept its influence. I would have to become more Blood.

<bigbreak>

I was still walking across my ruinous bridge. It was a long way across the chasm. And my eyes had decided to start crying. I kept having to blink the tears away so I could see where I was going. It was making it take extra concentration to keep rolling Rinn along steadily.

Even if I could make myself accept the Blood God… how?

<em>Rinn</em> would know what to do. She was really into this Blood stuff. She'd probably say something like "just feel your feelings!" or "look to your own heart!" like it made perfect sense. But my feelings didn't make sense. If I let them control me, I wouldn't be able to think or get anything done. That was why I had to keep each of them under careful management. If I got upset when I had to do something important, it could destroy everything I had worked for, and then I would have much more to be upset about. Being upset was supposed to mean you <em>didn't</em> want something to happen, so it made no sense to be upset if that would cause more of it.

That was why I ?????. It was like I had told Rinn, months ago now. I had to take each of my feelings out for a drive, in a controlled way, when it was safe. That way I could know their limits. I could know how to put them back away when they were getting in my way.

But that was something to do when it was <em>safe</em>. Not something to do <em>now</em>. ?????.

I kept that thought in my head for a while, mulling it over.

It was wrong.

Now <em>was</em> the time to take my feelings out for a drive. [????? Reasoning involving the Waiting God]

Well, not <em>now</em>. When I did it, it might have physical effects on the world, so I needed to get Rinn to more stable ground first.

?????

<bigbreak>

I sat. I stared.

I hadn't done this in a long time. Ever since I was chosen as the Farseer, I had been entirely focused on how to keep us both alive. Managing Rinn's feelings was important to keep us physically safe, so that was what I had filled my mind with. My own feelings weren't important to that, except when they were relevant to keeping our relationship healthy. So I had held them back for this whole time.

I was already getting a headache. I didn't want to do this.

But the Waiting was in my nature. To achieve my goals, I would always do what I needed to, no matter how painful it was in the moment. And the pain was waiting for me, right in the back of my mind where I had stored it away. All I had to do was bring it forward.

Decisively, I brought it forward.

The sun was glaring in my eyes. It was hard to breathe. There was so much pain in my head, so much emptiness, I didn't know how to handle it. ?????

My eyes were crying again. It hurt. Was this what the Blood God wanted? Was it Blood to just have all this pain? With Blood, the pain was supposed to <em>mean</em> something.

Why? Why did it always have to be me? Why did I have to do all the work when everyone else could only see what was right in front of them? ?????

[????? I was discontent just sitting here]. I wanted something more. What did I actually want? I couldn't tell. I tried to pay attention to what I was feeling. For a moment, I had an impulse to curl up on the ground. But that didn't make sense. If I curled up on the ground, that would just give me extra, physical pain, not the cathartic feeling I seemed to be imagining. So that wasn't really what I wanted. Or was it? I couldn't tell. What was the Blood thing to do? It definitely wasn't Blood to keep sitting around wondering about it. Blood was more impulsive than that. Was I supposed to just follow the impulse without thinking about it? That might be it. I tried to force myself to curl up, the way I had imagined. That ran into a block. I couldn't get myself to do it.

[????? Yali eventually figures out how to do it by releasing herself instead of forcing herself, then collapses awkwardly on the bench(?) And it hurts and seems kind of pathetic but then finally a bit of catharsis shows up]



?????

And along with the portal, the others were already there. Alchemist and Morrow.

I would probably have liked Alchemist a lot better if I hadn't had to do so much work to stop them from getting themself killed. I might even have liked Morrow better if the Seeking God hadn't pointed the worst part of him directly at the one I loved. But the past cannot be changed.

I listened for the future. I felt myself walk towards the portal. I saw Morrow hurry towards me and speak to me, ask me questions. I felt myself lash out at him. I felt myself hold back. I felt ?????. I saw both of them step away from me, huddling quiet and scared at a distance. I saw us maintain an uncomfortable truce until the time came to enter the portal.

This was not the future I would choose. I could do better. I cared about Rinn, and Rinn wouldn't want me to do anything that would upset Alchemist.

I listened for a different future. I felt myself pretending to be calm, answering Morrow's questions so that Alchemist would think we had an understanding. I felt the futures where my frustration built up until I struck him again, ?????. I listened for a future where I would navigate my feelings, where I could keep the illusion going and maintain the peace between us. I saw the three of us waiting together at the portal. I felt [????? not so great]. This was not the future I would choose. [????? With those feelings, I would not be prepared to face the Waiting God.]

I listened for a different future. I knew that both of them were already afraid of me. I felt myself march towards the portal, determined to make them be the ones to suffer, instead of me. When Morrow ran to meet me, I shouted him down. I ordered them both to be quiet and speak only to answer my questions. Finally, at the end of everything, I could <em>finally</em> just make them give me the peace and quiet I deserved. No more staying on good terms with Alchemist just in case we needed more potions. No more letting words come out of Morrow's disgusting face. I would finally just get what <em>I</em> wanted. And then I could face the Waiting God with pride. I would be the one who was in control.

As much as part of me liked that future, it was not the one I would choose either. I could still do better.

<bigbreak>

After a dozen more futures, I found the one that satisfied me. I forced myself to my feet, hefted the handle of Rinn's wagon, and headed for the portal.

Morrow approached me, as I had seen. I caught his hand, keeping it close between us, out of Alchemist's view. I looked in his eyes to make sure I could see the fear there. "Don't speak to me," I said quietly.

I let go of Morrow's hand. He backed away from me. This was going well.

I rolled the wagon close to the portal, where Alchemist was waiting. Alchemist nervously approached and looked at Rinn's head, the only part of her that was sticking out of the foam. Tears filled their eyes.

"Is, she… You used, the…"

"The second one we made," I said gently. "?????"

"Will she… that one was…"

Alchemist was trying to ask about the side effects of the potion. In the futures, I had tried dozens of responses before I found one that would [????? keep Alchemist from worrying].

[????? Alchemist asks about Justicar]

"Dead," I said. "We couldn't convince her to stop." I waited for Alchemist to glance at Rinn, wondering if Rinn had been the one who killed her. I said the best thing I had found to assuage their worries. "We did it together."

"Oh. I guess, you had to do it…" Tears dripped down their face.

"I wish I could tell you something else."

"I know."
