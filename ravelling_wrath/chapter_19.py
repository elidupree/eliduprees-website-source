Two bodies lay before me. One dead, one only unconscious. One Justicar. One Rinn.

Was it over?

I listened for the future. There was [????? details of the other ravellers]. [????? Something about the strong pulse of rinn's heartbeat in every corner of the future, reaching to the final portal].

It was â€“

If I said it was over, I would sit down, and I wouldn't get up again for a long time. But there were many things I still needed to do.

First, I would have to look at Rinn. There would still be injuries on her body. But logically, I knew that she was not in pain, and the healing potion I had given her had seen to that. So there was no need for me to feel anxious about what I saw.

I looked.



?????

In the first aid videos I had seen, they said that you were supposed to put an unconscious person on their side, to make sure they could breathe properly. Did that apply to this situation? If I put Rinn on her side, it would put a lot of weight on one of her shoulders. And <em>both</em> of her shoulders had been crushed. They were being magically healed, but I didn't know if it was possible for them to heal into a deformed position. I checked the future, but the healing process wouldn't be complete until after we returned to the material world, so I couldn't see far enough to be sure.

Could I put her in a different position?

Also, how would I transport her? One way or another, she would have to arrive at the final portal. She was light enough that I could carry her, but if I slipped or jostled her along the way, it could reinjure her.

?????

If I left Justicar's body now, there would be no one left to say the prayer for the dead. According to tradition, anyone who left a body un[?????honored] would be cursed for life. I was not sure if the curse was literal, but this would not be a good time to risk being cursed, not after everything we had just survived. But which prayer should I say? Every god had its own prayer for the dead. I knew all the Waiting prayers by heart, but [????? it seemed offensive] to say a Waiting prayer when it was the Waiting God who had created the situation that caused her death. The Stern prayer was what she would want, but the Stern prayer also said "[????? may your sacrifice be successful]". I would not be able to say that sincerely. And in the eyes of the gods, an insincere prayer was the same as no prayer at all.

Could I say a Blood prayer?

To be true to the Blood God, I would have to say the prayer with true emotion. But if I felt the emotions that my body wanted me to feel, I wouldn't be able to keep doing what I needed to do.

In the end, I settled with the Broken. [????? The Broken prayer]
