The Blood God's Gate nestled my body like a hand in a glove.

Only now, I realized that all of the other four Gates had been trying to squeeze my soul through shapes where it didn't fit. But this one was <em>made</em> for me. My blood pumped warmly through my veins. I floated, submerged in a sea of gentle pressure, cradling me and feeding me with strength. I breathed in through every pore of my skin, absorbing its energy. My heart, still stained with worries and pain, began to fill with warm, relaxed, irrepressible power. Once my heart was full, the power overflowed into my chest. Once my chest was full, it overflowed into my limbs. Slowly, it expanded into every fingertip. My hands were ready to ?????. My toes were ready to launch me into a springing leap that would carry me across the soaring sky. It flowed into my neck and shoulders, pushing aside the old tension and leaving my muscles with perfect strength and control. It flowed into my jaw, my tongue, my lips. ?????

And then, when I was completely filled, when my body had received every swallow of fuel it could take, the way slid open. The rest of the Blood God's power pulsed at my back, endless, encouraging, ready to lift me up no matter how many times I fell.

Effortlessly, I stepped into the world.

It was the city from my dreams, the city of steel and stone, with a blazing sun that pulsed like a heart. I basked in the warm sunlight, turning my chest to face the power of the wind, my eyes drinking up the vivid colors. The city's banners of red and gold and black, the sky of brilliant blue, the sun a blazing orange like sunset and midday rolled into one. I raised my arms and unleashed a flare of soulfire around me, just because I could. At last, at last, this was a world I could feel my heart in.

And then <em>she</em> was there as well.

Her feet thumped onto the ground scarcely five meters in front of me. Concentrating, she drank a potion, and I felt the shield shimmer into existence around her – the same shield she'd used in the fourth layer. I laughed easily. "Relax, I'm not going to attack you. I know what we're doing."

"Tell me what we're doing."

She was focused on the plan, and her focus on the plan was beautiful. I smiled as the words rolled off my tongue. "First we're going to kick Justicar's ass, then you're going to drink the unravelling potion. I survive. You survive. The Blood God rejuvenates. The Waiting God doesn't. It's a perfect ending."

"Good enough." Her eyes drilled past me, looking into the future. "This is it," she said grimly. "Justicar will be here soon."

"Already?" I said. But I wasn't really surprised. This was <em>my</em> world, the Blood God's world. There was no reason to wait around. It was time to get things over with. "Let's go, then!"

"Go? Go where?"

I raised my arm towards the sun, where it hung over a distant part of the city. "Towards the center of the Blood God's power."

Yali set her feet against the flagstones, solemnly facing towards the sun. She stared along the long uphill road, past the enormous arches and jagged towers, to the tiny, distant black dot that was the highest point of the city, standing high astride the city like a crown of steel. Standing directly beneath the sun, the crown was joined to the sky by a pillar of brilliant light.

"That is also the location of the final portal," Yali said. "I understand."

We moved.

?????

[????? Perhaps in response to Yali saying the world is overwhelming, Rinn feeling like she's the equal of every huge building, like she could take them down in one punch; examining the muscles of the city, "I punched it affectionately"]

?????


"When Justicar gets here, she does something that interferes with my Seeing. It's like a white light that I can't see past.


?????

"Justicar will come to us before long. I have some potions I'm going to drink to prepare for whatever happens. I would have brought some for you, but –"

Part of me felt like saying, <em>how come I don't get any potions?</em> But it was only a small part. She could use potions if she wanted to. I didn't need any. I had myself, and that was stronger than any potion.

"– because if it comes to a fight, your soulfire will purge them from your system anyway."

"Good point."

Yali drank [????? number] potions, one after another. The power of sorcery sizzled around her. I could feel the shield she'd used in the previous layer. I could feel an aura of strength and speed, and some other things I couldn't recognize. Looking at her with my eyes, I half expected her to look incredibly badass, but she actually looked softer and wiser instead. 

?????

<em>Deception!!</em> cried out a tiny part of me. Was she trying to feed me the unravelling potion?! But that was impossible. If it was the unravelling potion, I would be able to feel its energy, [????? description matching the first description]. But <em>this</em> potion felt warm and wholesome. It smelled of sweetness and comfort, promising to waft my pain away and carry me home. How could I think this was deception? This was Yali. She was strength. She was safety. She was love.

I raised my neck – the only part of me that I could still move – and let her press the potion to my lips. Its sweetness flooded into my mouth. Its warmth expanded in my chest. One by one, its effects reached each of the pains that were tearing apart my body, and wiped them gently away. And finally, it reached my head, and all of my scrambling thoughts began to fade, leaving me to drift away to a soft and comfortable darkness. ''',
