The Blood God's Gate nestled my body like a hand in a glove.

Only now, I realized that all of the other four Gates had been trying to squeeze my soul through shapes where it didn't fit. But this one was <em>made</em> for me. My blood pumped warmly through my veins. I floated, submerged in a sea of gentle pressure, cradling me and feeding me with strength. I breathed in through every pore of my skin, absorbing its energy. My heart, still stained with worries and pain, began to fill with warm, relaxed, irrepressible power. Once my heart was full, the power overflowed into my chest. Once my chest was full, it overflowed into my limbs. Slowly, it expanded into every fingertip. My hands were ready to ?????. My toes were ready to launch me into a springing leap that would carry me across the soaring sky. It flowed into my neck and shoulders, pushing aside the old tension and leaving my muscles with perfect strength and control. It flowed into my jaw, my tongue, my lips. ?????

And then, when I was completely filled, when my body had received every swallow of fuel it could take, the way folded open. The rest of the Blood God's power pulsed at my back, endless, encouraging, ready to lift me up no matter how many times I fell.

Effortlessly, I stepped into the world.

It was the city from my dreams, the city of steel and stone, with a blazing sun that pulsed like a heart. I basked in the warm sunlight, turning my chest to face the power of the wind, my eyes drinking up the vivid colors. The city's banners of red and gold and black, the sky of brilliant blue, the sun a blazing orange like sunset and midday rolled into one. I raised my arms and unleashed a flare of soulfire around me, just because I could. At last, at last, this was a world I could feel my heart in.

And then <em>she</em> was there as well.

Her feet thumped onto the ground scarcely five meters in front of me. Concentrating, she drank a potion, and I felt the shield shimmer into existence around her – the same shield she'd used in the fourth layer. I laughed easily. "Relax, I'm not going to attack you. I know what we're doing."

"Tell me what we're doing."

She was focused on the plan, and her focus on the plan was beautiful. I smiled as the words rolled off my tongue. "First we're going to kick Justicar's ass, then you're going to drink the unravelling potion. I survive. You survive. The Blood God rejuvenates. The Waiting God doesn't. It's a perfect ending."

"Good enough." Her eyes drilled past me, looking into the future. "This is it," she said grimly. "Justicar will be here soon."

"Already?" I said. But I wasn't really surprised. This was <em>my</em> world, the Blood God's world. There was no reason to wait around. It was time to get things over with. "Let's go, then!"

"Go? Go where?"

I raised my arm towards the sun, where it hung over a distant part of the city. "Towards the heart of the Blood God's power."

Yali set her feet against the flagstones, solemnly facing towards the sun. She stared along the long uphill road, past the enormous arches and jagged towers, to the tiny, distant black dot that was the highest point of the city, standing high astride the city like a crown of steel. Perched directly beneath the sun, the crown was joined to the sky by a pillar of brilliant light.

"That is also the location of the final portal," Yali said. "I understand."

We moved.

My muscles warmed from our steady walking. We flowed up the street, like two drops of blood flowing up a vein, returning to the heart. We passed shattered towers still reaching towards the sky, twisted monuments of blackened steel, sculptures like raised fists towering high above. The sheer scale of everything was enormous. Even where a one of the great stone fingers had broken from a sculpture and fallen to the ground, it was taller than we were.

And all throughout the city, densely braided cables of steel snaked about, some half buried in the ground, some crawling up the buildings like vines. An endless network tying the city together, they nestled the buildings and spires, as if they had all grown together as a single being.

I punched one of them affectionately. "These are like the muscles of the city!" I said.

[????? examining the muscles of the city, "I punched it affectionately"]

<bigbreak>

"I feel like we're so small," said Yali.

"I don't!" I said cheerfully. "We're the equals of this world! See those towers? They're so huge! But we have, like, the pride of humanity inside us! We could punch them down if we wanted! Or build our own! Every human is equal in value to the entire world!"

"That, that, that sounded awesome, but I'm not sure if it makes sense?"

I laughed. "Check this out!" I knelt down, pressing my hands to the flagstones beneath us. An enormous hand of stone emerged from the ground under us, its palm lifting us up. It bore us upwards and upwards, past shattered windows and smokestacks, past the tallest spires of ancient temples, until we finally rose above the skyline and saw the entire city laid out before us. The city seemed to stretch on into infinity in every direction, a forest of silent silhouettes against the dusky sky.

I watched Yali looking out over the city, taking it all in. Her eyes were slightly widened, her head pulled slightly back. Coming from Yali, that meant she was totally blown away.

"And if you think <em>that's</em> awesome," I continued, "then just wait 'til you see what you already have, right here." I pressed my hand over her heart.

She answered with her own hand over mine[????? Ambiguity]. Then she smiled wistfully. "I love how sincere you are. I will try to, to, to remember this moment, for sometime in the future when I can appreciate it properly."

I felt the impulse to complain, but a heavier feeling laid over it. "I… understand," I said, the weight of truth weighing down my voice. "Your heart… isn't ready to accept this."

"It will be! Once I take the time to, to deal with things. Once I, I…"

"I understand." 

"It just, isn't something I can think about right now. Not until the situation with the gods is resolved."

"Right. Then let's get it resolved."

I swept a hand across the skyline. From where we stood, a golden pathway rolled out. From the countless little pathways of the city, the muscles rose up, moving firmly into position to carry it, a spiderweb of cables holding it up as it snaked between the rooftops. My pathway gleamed invitingly, a direct route to our destination. I took Yali's hand and started out along its length.

"Can you make a train, too?" said Yali distractedly.

I laughed. "I <em>could</em> make a train. We could ride as far as the moon and back. But we'll never get closer to the heart unless we move there with our own bodies."

"I'm not sure I like this Blood God of yours," said Yali affectionately.

<bigbreak>

Yali paused as we walked along the golden road.

"Justicar's getting close," she said. "I have some potions I'm going to drink to prepare for whatever happens. I would have brought some for you, but –"

An old part of me felt like saying, <em>how come I don't get any potions?</em> But it was only a small part. She could use potions if she wanted to. I didn't need any. I had myself, and that was stronger than any potion.

"– because if it comes to a fight, your soulfire will purge them from your system anyway."

"Good point."

Yali drank [????? number] potions, one after another. The power of sorcery sizzled around her. I could feel the shield she'd used in the previous layer. I could feel an aura of strength and speed, and some other things I couldn't recognize. Looking at her with my eyes, I half expected her to look incredibly badass, but she actually looked softer and wiser instead. 

Then she spun and looked me in the eye. "When Justicar gets here, she does something that interferes with my Seeing. It's like a white light that I can't see past. That's not a good sign. But still, remember the plan. If Justicar is willing to talk, stay back and let me do the talking. No matter what she says, just stay calm, keep your hands open, and don't do anything to provoke her. And if she attacks us, kill her."

"I can do that." I whipped out a Blood Blade, its whole length bright red and blazing with soulfire. I whirled and slashed it through the air, cutting imaginary enemies into dozens of pieces. In the next instant, I let the blade melt back into my body. I opened my hands and let a warm sense of peace flow through me.

Yali squinted. "That was very fast, how you switched back and forth. I could almost have missed it."

I smiled confidently. She just didn't understand. "I didn't switch anything. My heart goes out to everyone who has blood. My fury strikes at anyone who would tear us down. I am one being."

"Uh… Okay then."

?????

[????? Justicar takes her first swing at Yali]

But somehow, her sword didn't go in the right direction. Yali had already sidestepped the blow. In the next instant, Justicar recovered and took another swing. But no matter how many times the sword slashed and stabbed, it didn't come close to Yali at all. Yali just kept calmly stepping out of the way, using small, simple movements to avoid every attack. [????? It was making Justicar look pretty incompetent.]

[????? Intersperse with dealing with Rinn's own stuff:] I realized what was going on. Yali was using the Seeing to see exactly where Justicar was going to attack next. ?????

They were at a standstill. As much as the sword darted and flashed, it had no chance of getting past Yali's attention. On the other hand, Justicar ????verbed, showing no sign of tiring or slowing down. [????? My eyes got lost in the movement]

And then Yali struck.

As Justicar took a swing, Yali surged forward, going right past the sword and slamming into Justicar's chest. In the fraction of a second it took Justicar to regain her balance, Yali grabbed onto her sword arm and heaved, sending her stumbling. With a disciplined motion, Justicar spun around, landing solidly on her feet and facing Yali again. But there was one difference.

Yali was now holding the sword.

Yali held the sword calmly at her side, leaning on the hilt and pressing the razor-sharp point into a stone brick. She gave Justicar a moment to register what had happened. Then she spoke. "I will give you one chance to hear what I have to say," she said.

"Speak quickly," said Justicar tightly. Her hands glowed, lines of light stabbing into the air, ready to unleash some new attack at a moment's notice.

"We have all been deceived," said Yali gravely. "?????

?????

Our bodies were locked together. For a long moment, we hung in a delicate balance on the three feet we had between us. But then, we began to topple. Our bodies fell together, crashing among the wreckage. Justicar's stiff body landed on top of mine, ?????.

????? It was over. I relaxed into the pain, [????? My blades, including any leg supports] melted away into blood. ?????

And then Yali was there. Her hands heaved Justicar off of me, letting the sun's warming light fall on my head and chest. I couldn't move my arms to lift myself, but I bent my neck towards her, closing my eyes happily. Yali was here. Everything was going to be okay.

She knelt beside me. I felt her place one arm behind my back and lift me up into a sitting position, pulling me close to her. "Drink," she said softly, lifting a potion up to my face.

<em>Deception!!</em> cried out a tiny part of me. Was she trying to feed me the unravelling potion?! But that was impossible. If it was the unravelling potion, I would be able to feel its energy, that blinding haze of force that threatened to tear the universe apart. But <em>this</em> potion felt warm and wholesome. It smelled of sweetness and comfort, promising to waft my pain away and carry me home. How could I think this was deception? This was Yali. She was strength. She was safety. She was love.

I raised my neck – the only part of me that I could still move – and let her press the potion to my lips. Its sweetness flooded into my mouth. Its warmth expanded in my chest. One by one, its ?????effects reached each of the pains that were tearing apart my body, and wiped them gently away. And finally, it reached my head, and all of my scrambling thoughts began to fade, leaving me to drift away to a soft and comfortable darkness. ''',
