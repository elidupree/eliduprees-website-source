The Blood God's Gate nestled my body like a hand in a glove.

Only now, I realized that all of the other four Gates had been trying to squeeze my soul through shapes where it didn't fit. But this one was <em>made</em> for me. My blood pumped warmly through my veins. I floated, submerged in a sea of gentle pressure, cradling me and feeding me with strength. I breathed in through every pore of my skin, absorbing its energy. My heart, still stained with worries and pain, began to fill with warm, relaxed, irrepressible power. Once my heart was full, the power overflowed into my chest. Once my chest was full, it overflowed into my limbs. Slowly, it expanded into every fingertip. My hands were ready to ?????. My toes were ready to launch me into a springing leap that would carry me across the soaring sky. It flowed into my neck and shoulders, pushing aside the old tension and leaving my muscles with perfect strength and control. It flowed into my jaw, my tongue, my lips. ?????

And then, when I was completely filled, when my body had received every swallow of fuel it could take, the way slid open. The rest of the Blood God's power pulsed at my back, endless, encouraging, ready to lift me up no matter how many times I fell.

Effortlessly, I stepped into the world.

"Justicar will come to us before long. I have some potions I'm going to drink to prepare for whatever happens. I would have brought some for you, but –"

Part of me felt like saying, <em>how come I don't get any potions?</em> But it was only a small part. She could use potions if she wanted to. I didn't need any. I had myself, and that was stronger than any potion.

"– because if it comes to a fight, your soulfire will purge them from your system anyway."

"Good point."

Yali drank [????? number] potions, one after another. The power of sorcery sizzled around her. I could feel the shield she'd used in the previous layer. I could feel an aura of strength and speed, and some other things I couldn't recognize. Looking at her with my eyes, I half expected her to look incredibly badass, but she actually looked softer and wiser instead.
