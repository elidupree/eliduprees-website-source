"Can be rest of you stop manifesting for a while?" said Yali suddenly.

"Sure, but why?" I said.

"It's the Seeing. It's –"

"Ooh! Ooh!" said Morrow. "Does it mess it up when he manifest? How does it work? Tell me!"

"The truth is, even though it's called the Seeing," began Yali patiently, "it's not much like seeing with my eyes. It's more like, sort of… holding very still, to <em>listen</em> for the future. And your manifesting is very… noisy. So it's hard to hear anything past what you're about to manifest."

"Oh! So – wait a minute, you just asked us to stop manifesting! So before that, you were <em>already</em> about to ask us to stop manifesting! So you shouldn't have seen us manifesting anything in the future! How does that make sense?!"

"I think, I think, maybe it's about the fact that it was <em>my</em> decision? I mean, I didn't decide to tell you until after I saw it, so maybe, maybe…"

"If the Farseer could reliably predict the results of the Farseer's own future decisions," Justicar cut in, "then what would happen if she foresaw a danger? Naturally, she would act to prevent the danger. But then the danger would never occur as she saw it. That would be a contradiction, so it follows that, <em>until</em> the Farseer has committed to a decision, she can still See the results of alternate decisions she could make." She looked to Yali. "Is that not so?"

"Something like that, yes."
