"So," I said, summarizing the last hour of discussion, "the Alchemist is, like, infinitely far away. They broke their star, and it's not on the pattern anymore. We don't know if they did it on purpose. We don't know if they have any control over where it's going. And <em>we</em> have no way to get off the pattern to follow them, because what they did was probably an Alchemist power. And we have no way to communicate with them. And Yali's power is useless as usual, because apparently the Waiting God still think this is part of the challenge. And even if they <em>did</em> figure out where we are, and <em>could</em> move their star on purpose, they might crash into us really fast, because they don't have the pattern to slow them down at the right moment. It would be even worse than what happened with Morrow, because, uh…"

"Because Morrow was slowed down by air resistance. All of our bodies would be destroyed, hostile intent or no."

"Right, because there's air in space."

"Right."

?????

"Her? I thought you called the Alchemist 'he' earlier. "

"I just say whatever feels right at the time!"

"Woah, so is the Alchemist, like, genderfluid?" I said. "Also, hang on, what's the Alchemist's name?"

"I'm in her mind!! Do people normally think about their own name??"

"<em>I</em> do," I said, smirking. "Every morning I wake up and say, 'Sure is a fine day to be Rinn Akatura!" I was exaggerating, but only a little.

"You should ask for his, or her, name," said Justicar. "So that we know what to call him. Or her."

Unfortunately for Justicar, Morrow was already [????? back to interacting with Alchemist]

?????


"So, now that you're here, what's your name? We've just been calling you 'the Alchemist' this whole time."

The Alchemist wobbled back and forth shyly.

"It's okay!! Rinn's a friend!" said Morrow.

The Alchemist hesitated. "Well I, maybe, my name? There are, a few different things people call me. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad? To just be the Alchemist? Do some alchemizing?"

"Alchemy," corrected Justicar. The Alchemist flinched.

"Technically," said Yali, "The Alchemist's ability to make potions <em>isn't</em> alchemy. It has more in common with sorcery."

"That is impossible," said Justicar. "The titles are given to us by the gods. They cannot be incorrect."

"Maybe what <em>we</em> know as 'alchemy' is called that because it's similar to what the <em>Alchemist</em> does, not the other way around. But in any case –"

"Oh my gods, you guys," I said.

"Everybody shut UPPPPP!" yelled Morrow. "Alchemist has something to say!!"

Alchemist smiled nervously.

"Are you, uh, sure about that?" I said to Morrow. "They don't seem to be –"

"I said shut UPPPPP!!"

"Okay, fine."

After a very awkward silence, Alchemist managed to psych themself up into saying something. "I – me? I can make potions?"

"It is one of the abilities available to the Alchemist," said Yali. "Once you learn how to do it, you should be able to store parts of the Broken God's power in a physical medium,

?????

"Now that were altogether – all five of us – we can…" I wasn't quite sure where I was going with this, but there is something that felt almost nostalgic about the five of us all being together and friendly with each other – or at least tolerating each other, I guess. There was an irritating doubt in the back of my mind, but for now, I just wanted to have fun. "Let's have a campfire! And then we can tell stories around the campfire!"

"We could also tell stories without setting anything on fire," said Justicar.

"Yeah, but then we wouldn't get to set things on fire." I dropped a pile of logs out of thin air onto the middle of the star. Then I took a big, exaggerated breath inwards, and breathed fire all over the logs. Alchemist startled. "Haha, didn't mean to spook ya!" I said. The logs weren't properly on fire yet, so I gave them another few fiery breaths until they caught.

"Now everyone sit around the fire!" I said. They all did, to varying degrees of reluctance. Yali and I sat on a camping mat, with Yali sleepily putting in one arm around my shoulders. On the other side, Morrow and Alchemist were in a similar position. Alchemist initially seemed nervous about the fire, but once they relaxed and started warming themself, their face melted into a dreamy smile. It was really heartwarming.

Justicar insisted on staying in a stiff chair a slight distance away.

"Wait, so you can just read our minds all the time?"

"No, only Alchemist's."

"What."

"Ow'm I supposed to read those two's minds past how they're on guard all the time?"

"What about me?" I said.

"Oh, I don't NEED to read YOUR mind. I can already tell what you're going to do next."

"Oh yeah? What am I going to do next?"

"First you're going to deny it, then you're going to complain that it's not fair."

"No, I'm not."

"There's the denial…" said Justicar.

"Hey!" <em>That's not fair</em>, I thought, but this time my mind managed to get a step ahead. I shut my mouth instead. Yali chuckled.

?????

"Can be rest of you stop manifesting for a while?" said Yali suddenly.

"Sure, but why?" I said.

"It's the Seeing. It's –"

"Ooh! Ooh!" said Morrow. "Does it mess it up when we manifest? How does it work? Tell me!"

"The truth is, even though it's called the Seeing," began Yali patiently, "it's not much like seeing with my eyes. It's more like, sort of… holding very still, to <em>listen</em> for the future. And your manifesting is very… noisy. So it's hard to hear anything past what you're about to manifest."

"Oh! So – wait a minute, you just asked us to stop manifesting! So before that, you were <em>already</em> about to ask us to stop manifesting! So you shouldn't have seen us manifesting anything in the future! How does that make sense?!"

"I think, I think, maybe it's about the fact that it was <em>my</em> decision? I mean, I didn't decide to tell you until after I saw it, so maybe, maybe…"

"If the Farseer could reliably predict the results of the Farseer's own future decisions," Justicar cut in, "then what would happen if she foresaw a danger? Naturally, she would act to prevent the danger. But then the danger would never occur as she saw it. That would be a contradiction, so it follows that, <em>until</em> the Farseer has committed to a decision, she can still See the results of alternate decisions she could make." She looked to Yali. "Is that not so?"

"Something like that, yes."
