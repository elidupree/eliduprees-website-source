"So," I said, summarizing the last hour of discussion, "the Alchemist is, like, infinitely far away. They broke their star, and it's not on the pattern anymore. We don't know if they did it on purpose. We don't know if they have any control over where it's going. And <em>we</em> have no way to get off the pattern to follow them, because what they did was probably an Alchemist power. And we have no way to communicate with them. And Yali's power is useless as usual, because apparently the Waiting God still thinks this is part of the challenge. And even if they <em>did</em> figure out where we are, and <em>could</em> move their star on purpose, they might crash into us really fast, because they don't have the pattern to slow them down at the right moment. It would be even worse than what happened with Morrow, because, uh…"

"Because Morrow was slowed down by air resistance," supplied Yali.

"Right, because there's air everywhere, even though we're in space."

"Right. The air generally moves along with the closest star. But the stars control the movement of the air, so with the star itself moving, there would be nothing to slow it down. All of our bodies would be destroyed, hostile intent or no."

"Stern take it."

"What if we made a really bright light?" said Morrow. "And then used it to flash out a code!"

"If the Alchemist even points their telescope in this direction…" I said.

Yali shook her head. "What we see in the telescope isn't the literal light of the stars at all. It's a soul thing."

"But we can see where the other Ravellers are! So we could move around in the stars and spell out a message! Like skywriting!" exclaimed Morrow. But then he drooped. Even Morrow could see the obvious flaws with that plan.

"There's <em>gotta</em> be something," I said. "We've all got magic powers! And all we need is to talk at a long distance! Doesn't any of us have any powers that work at a distance? Hey, Justicar, I saw you manifesting at a distance earlier, can you manifest a message to where the Alchemist is?"

"<em>A</em> distance, yes. But I doubt I could manifest a kilometer away, much less the distances of the stars."

"What about you, Yali? Your Seeing can go any distance, right? I know it doesn't work for this exactly, but what if –"

Yali shook her head sadly. "A Farseer's powers only ever obtain information, not change the world directly. Not even to communicate."

"Uh, Morrow…? I mean, you <em>did</em> say you smelled Yali's mind from space?"

"That might actually work," said Yali. "The mind is part of the soul. And our souls aren't necessarily considered 'far away from each other' just because our bodies are…"

"Ooh! So I could sniff around for the Alchemist! I could totally do that, what if –" Morrow threw his head back, pointing his face up into space.

It wasn't anything like when Yali was using the Seeing. Morrow immediately shut his eyes really tight, opened his mouth, and waggled his tongue around. He swayed around, like he was exploring for the best-tasting part of the air, then flopped down onto his knees and started <em>licking</em> the star we were standing on. His ass was sticking up in the air, it was pretty comical.

"Why is he licking the floor??" I said.

"If it <em>is</em> about the soul connection… all the stars are part of the same pattern, so the star itself would have the closest connection to anything on any other star," said Yali.

"Issh ieh uh ick uhhbehh," said Morrow, still licking the floor furiously.

"What?"

He turned his head sideways to yell to us. "It's like a big puppy!"

"The Alchemist is like a big puppy?" said Yali.

"Can puppies be Ravellers?" I said.

"What is like a big puppy?" said Justicar.

"There's a human there too! I can barely smell it!"

"A human <em>and</em> a puppy?" I said. "Would the gods bring someone's pet into the Otherworld with them?"

"It's never happened before…" said Yali.

"It's <em>not</em> a puppy! It's totally different! It doesn't have paws!" yelled Morrow. He kept licking the star for another minute. "It can't feel, or see, or hear anything! It's lost and confused! It had a bright line to hold onto, but it dropped it and now it can't find it again!!"

"What <em>is</em> it??" I said.

Morrow was still busy licking the floor. Justicar raised an eyebrow. "There <em>is</em> one other mind that should be in here with us. One that we <em>would</em> call 'it'."

"It's not the Waiting God," said Yali. "I would know. But… A mind that isn't human… A mind that's connected to the star…" With a sudden realization, she whispered an old saying: "<em>Only the Broken God can create life.</em>"

"You think the Alchemist <em>created</em> a new form of life??" I said.

"This doesn't add up," said Justicar, unimpressed. "Newly created life would not have a strong soul. But this is something that the Imminent sensed much <em>more</em> strongly than he sensed the Alchemist themself. It makes much more sense if he is sensing a god."

"It's the star!!" I yelled.

"What?"

"It's the star! The Alchemist <em>brought their star to life</em>! Think about it! The star was attached to the pattern, but now it's not! That's exactly what Morrow just said! Hey, Morrow! Tell it to come over here!"

"Don't do that!" shouted Yali. "If it <em>is</em> the star, tell it to come close to here but be careful not to crash into us!

The next few minutes were a frantic struggle to figure out how to communicate with a living star when all you had was magic mind powers, and when the person with the magic mind powers had zero attention span. Morrow eventually figured out a way to insert thoughts into the mind of the star, so he could read what the star thought back in response. And then there was a problem of how to tell the star where to go. As far as we could tell, it literally had no senses, except for the sense of whether it was on the pattern. And it just wasn't any more. It couldn't, like, tell when it was getting closer or farther away or anything.

The only thing it <em>could</em> do was try to move. And since it could never tell whether the moving was working, it had just kept trying to move every which way, hoping something would happen. And it didn't have a language to express which <em>direction</em> it was trying to move, so Morrow had to try to interpret it for us.

"Okay this! What it's doing now! It feels like '<em>glep</em>'!"

"Glep?"

"Glep!"

"Okay," said Yali, watching the telescope intently. "I'm not seeing movement right now. Tell it to <em>glep</em> as hard as it can, then we'll wait 10 minutes to see if it just has a slow buildup."

"It already glepped! It can't glep any farther! Now it feels like it should <em>kzz</em>!"

"Didn't it <em>kzz</em> earlier? And that took it farther away from us?"

"That's when kzz was hard! Like an engine backfiring! Now it's ready to kzz for real!"

"Okay. We can try kzz again, just to see. Justicar?"

"Done." Justicar wrote down "kzz" in a little notebook, along with the current time, down to the nearest ten seconds.

This went on for hours. It was hard to follow along, because I couldn't use the telescopes well enough to keep the moving star in view. But I was never bored. From the sound of things, the star could actually be here <em>soon</em>, because it didn't have to obey the normal rules. And then all five of us would be together! And even though I didn't have Morrow's magic or the others' knowledge, I still had plenty to do. It was my job to keep Morrow on task, because I was the one who knew how to talk to him. Yali and Justicar were too direct, just telling him what to do. But if you wanted him to actually do something, you had to <em>inspire</em> him. Like by hinting at what he could find out if he tried. Or by pretending you didn't think he could do it. He was a real sucker for dares and challenges, just like me.

"We're getting close!!" exclaimed Morrow from the floor. "The Alchemist! I can taste him! He's so lonely and sad!!" he said mournfully. "I'm going to think to him!"

For the next few minutes, Morrow didn't answer anything we said. He just kept licking the floor, his face turning alternately mournful and blissfully happy.

"His mind is <em>delicious</em>," Morrow raved. "Would you believe he actually didn't know he made the star come to life! But then I told her! She named her Neenu!"

"She… her?" I said. "Are there three people there??"

"I just say whatever feels right at the time!"

"Wait, do you mean – Woah, so is the Alchemist, like, genderfluid?" I said. "Also, hang on, Neenu is the star's name? What's the Alchemist's name?"

"I'm in her mind!! Do people normally think about their own name??"

"<em>I</em> do," I said, smirking. "Every morning I wake up and say, 'Sure is a fine day to be Rinn Akatura!" I was exaggerating, but I didn't <em>completely</em> make it up, haha.

"You should ask for his, or her, name," said Justicar. "So that we know what to call him. Or her."

Unfortunately for Justicar, Morrow was already back in his own world with the Alchemist.

?????

[????? Eventually they got here]. Neenu didn't sweep smoothly toward us like all the other stars we'd seen. She zigzagged back and forth erratically, like someone who was trying to juggle but kept almost dropping stuff.

?????

The Alchemist stood nervously at the edge of Neenu.

[????? It's just a little jump. You can do it!]

"Or WE could all go ride on Neenu!" said Morrow, jumping across. He immediately [????? hugged Alchemist, but with more details]. I jumped across to join them, then looked back to Yali.

"I can't do it," said Yali, standing at the edge of our old star and shuddering.

"What do you mean, you can't –"

"It's the Waiting God. It <em>knows</em> where that star is supposed to be!



"I have a duty to complete the challenge set by this world's god," said Justicar doubtfully. "Stepping onto this altered star seems to transgress that. But I suppose I also have a duty to make sure the rest of you remain safe." She strode across Yali's bridge.



"So, now that we're all here, what's your name? We've just been calling you 'the Alchemist' this whole time."

The Alchemist wobbled back and forth shyly.

"It's okay!! Rinn's a friend!" said Morrow.

The Alchemist hesitated. "Well I, maybe, my name? There are, a few different things people call me. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad? To just be the Alchemist? Do some alchemizing?"

"Alchemy," corrected Justicar. The Alchemist flinched.

"Technically," said Yali, "The Alchemist's ability to make potions <em>isn't</em> alchemy. It has more in common with sorcery."

"That is impossible," said Justicar. "The titles are given to us by the gods. They cannot be incorrect."

"Maybe what <em>we</em> know as 'alchemy' is called that because it's similar to what the <em>Alchemist</em> does, not the other way around. But in any case –"

"Oh my gods, you guys," I said.

"Everybody shut UPPPPP!" yelled Morrow. "Alchemist has something to say!!"

Alchemist smiled nervously.

"Are you, uh, sure about that?" I said to Morrow. "They don't seem to be –"

"I said shut UPPPPP!!"

"Okay, fine."

After a very awkward silence, Alchemist managed to psych themself up into saying something. "I – me? I can make potions?"

"It is one of the abilities that the Alchemist can learn," said Yali. "Once you learn how to do it, you should be able to store parts of the Broken God's power in a physical medium, like a potion."

"If I could, maybe, learn? To do that? If you could help me?"

"

?????

"Now that we're all together – all five of us – we can…" I wasn't quite sure where I was going with this, but there is something that felt almost nostalgic about the five of us all being together and friendly with each other – or at least tolerating each other, I guess. There was an irritating doubt in the back of my mind, but for now, I just wanted to have fun. "Let's have a campfire! And then we can tell stories around the campfire!"

"We could also tell stories without setting anything on fire," said Justicar.

"Yeah, but then we wouldn't get to set things on fire." I dropped a pile of logs out of thin air onto the middle of the star. Then I took a big, exaggerated breath inwards, and breathed fire all over the logs. Alchemist startled. "Haha, didn't mean to spook ya!" I said. The logs weren't properly on fire yet, so I gave them another few fiery breaths until they caught.

"Now everyone sit around the fire!" I said. They all did, to varying degrees of reluctance. Yali and I sat on a camping mat, with Yali sleepily putting in one arm around my shoulders. On the other side, Morrow and Alchemist were in a similar position. Alchemist initially seemed nervous about the fire, but once they relaxed and started warming themself, their face melted into a dreamy smile. It was really heartwarming.

Justicar insisted on staying in a stiff chair a slight distance away.

"I'll go first!" I said. "This one's for you, Yali. I'm finally going to tell you the one about how I jumped out of my window!"

"This'll be good!" said Morrow, bouncing up and down. "Tell us tell us!"

"Alllllright!" I clapped my hands over the fire. "So this one time in elementary school I got suspended for punching this annoying kid – don't look at me like that, I was like nine. Nowadays I only punch people if they actually hurt somebody. Anyway, the day I was suspended, my parents grounded me up in my room all day. But the problem was, that day was the day of…" I paused for effect "…the BIGGEST afterschool dodgeball tournament of my ENTIRE life. There was no way I was going to miss that for something stupid like getting suspended. So when afterschool time came, I was gonna sneak out. Problem was, Dad knew my tricks. So Dad had taken a work-from-home day and parked himself right at the bottom of the stairs while he worked. There was no way I could sneak past him, because the stairs were the only way to get down from my room. <em>Or so he thought!</em> There was also… – somebody give me a drumroll here –"

Nobody gave me a drumroll. I thought at least Morrow would do it, but no such luck. So I just kept going.

"<em>…the window.</em> See, right under my window, there was a bunch of big bushes. And they looked really soft and leafy, so I figured they'd make a good landing. My window wasn't built to be able to open, but I took an old coin and unscrewed it from the wall. I was really careful with the glass, I put it down on my bed without making any noise. And then I jumped out. And, well… Yeeeeaaaaaah so it turned out those bushes weren't as soft as I thought."

Alchemist cringed.

"Don't worry, I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything. I just got some really bad scrapes. But the worst thing is, I didn't EXPECT it, so I screamed out when it happened. Like, if I hadn't screamed, I could totally have still played dodgeball that way. But –" I sighed "– Mom and Dad came running and I was totally busted. They patched up the bleeding and then didn't let me out of their sight for the rest of the day. At least I got this cool scar though!" I unmanifested half of my pant leg so they could see the long scrape on my knee. Alchemist covered their face. Morrow came around the fire to take a closer look and poke at it.

"Haha, that tickles. Anyway, there's more to the story. See, Mom and Dad had, like, a huge fight about it later. I think they thought I couldn't hear them, but they were really loud and I could totally hear them through the walls. Mom was like 'that was too dangerous, she could have gotten seriously hurt, we need to reinforce all the upstairs windows so she can never do that again'. And Dad was like 'that is Just Wrong, she is our daughter, that would be like putting her in a cage'. And I'm pretty sure they never came to an agreement about that. They just never tried to ground me in my room again, haha."

Justicar let out a tiny sigh.

"You got a problem with that? Bet you think I'm a total terror and they SHOULD have put me in a cage."

"I won't rise to your provocation," said Justicar calmly. "A child cannot be expected to understand the need for rules. I certainly did not when I was a child myself. And I cannot judge another person's family from a simple story. All I can say is that it is a parent's duty to provide rules to structure a child's life. It seems possible that they were not fulfilling that duty even before this incident."

"Yeah," I said sarcastically, "I feel so deprived of rules. What a tragedy. Oh woe is me."

"Stop fighting, you two!" said Morrow.

"Wait, <em>you</em>? <em>You're</em> telling us to stop fighting?" I said incredulously.

"You're making Alchemist upset!! All he wants is for everyone to just get along! And maybe to have some nice stories where people have a good time instead of everyone getting hurt and fighting each other!"

"Wait, so you can just read our minds all the time?"

"No, only Alchemist's."

"What."

"Ow'm I supposed to read those two's minds past how they're on guard all the time? All I've got from them is emotions."

"What about me?" I said.

"Oh, I don't NEED to read YOUR mind. I can already tell what you're going to do next."

"Oh yeah? What am I going to do next?"

"First you're going to deny it, then you're going to complain that it's not fair."

"No, I'm not."

"There's the denial…" said Justicar.

"Hey!" <em>That's not fair</em>, I thought, but this time my mind managed to get a step ahead. I shut my mouth instead. Yali chuckled.

<bigbreak>

?????


It was weird. Morrow acted like a completely different person when he was around Alchemist. He wasn't just affectionate, he was also patient and reassuring. Not as patient as Yali or anything, but still totally different from his normal self.




?????

[????? I'm just breaking their concentration]

"????? – I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break your concentration!" Morrow looked around frantically, then jabbed his fingers at me and Justicar. "You two! We're going bottomside!"

"Why does Justicar have to come with us?" I said.

"He needs a break from all us extroverts!"

It took me a little while to realize what he was implying. "Wait, are you saying Justicar's an extrovert?!"

"Ssshhh!" Morrow half-dragged me over the edge of the star.

From behind me, I heard Justicar say, "Very well, I will accompany you. But I will not take such an undignified route." After a short while, a big metal staircase popped into existence near us. Justicar had manifested two staircases, one on each side of the star. The tops of the two staircases were joined together by a big half-circle walkway from one side of the star to the other. With a loud clank-clank-clank, Justicar walked up the stairs on her side, along the walkway, and down on our side. It <em>was</em> much more dignified than just falling around the edge. Then she sat down on her customary hard stool.

?????

"Will you <em>stop doing that??</em>" Morrow hissed at Justicar suddenly.

"Uh, she's not doing anything."

"I told you she's an extrovert! She keeps wanting to be closer to us! But then she SQUASHES it! Over and over again! I can't STAND it!" he spat.

"If you have a problem with the choices I make in what <em>should</em> be the privacy of my own mind," said Justicar, "it is not my responsibility to accommodate you."

Morrow was breathing hard, looking at Justicar with an anguished expression on his face. Normally I would have been happy to let him have a go at Justicar, but this was different. I didn't want him to do something stupid. "<em>Dude</em>," I said. I grabbed his shoulders and forced him to look back at me. "I can't believe I'm agreeing with Justicar, but if she wants to beat herself up, that's <em>really</em> not our problem." I kind of felt like I was lying, like Justicar being screwed up <em>was</em> my problem. But getting Morrow calmed down was more important.

?????

"By the way, are you gay?" I said. I'd kind of been assuming Morrow was gay based on how he acted towards me, but all the times he'd called Alchemist "she" had made me wonder. "I mean, I know you're into Alchemist, but that doesn't tell me much about in general, haha."

Morrow shrugged. "Gay is just who you fuck, right?"

"What? No way! It's about way more than that!"

"What is it then? How do you know if you're gay?"

"Do you actually not know, or are you just messing with me?"

Morrow smirked. "Whaddaya think?"

"I think you're just messing with me, but whatever, I'll tell you anyway. It's never really been a question whether <em>I'm</em> gay. For my whole life, I've been, like, <em>obsessed</em> with girls. Whenever there's a girl I like, I never want to be away from her. I want to know everything <em>about</em> her, I want to sleep in the same <em>bed</em> with her, I want to <em>impress</em> her – I've done loads of stupid shit to impress girls, haha. And if she's good at the same things I am, I want to <em>beat</em> her." I smirked. "Nothing gets me going like fighting with a girl I've got a crush on. Or, like, playing sports against her. <em>Girls</em>." I sighed happily. "Yeah, and now that I'm grown up and shit, I also want to fuck her. You know, in between doing all the other things."


?????

"Can the rest of you stop manifesting for a while?" said Yali suddenly.

"Sure, but why?" I said.

"It's the Seeing. It's –"

"Ooh! Ooh!" said Morrow. "Does it mess it up when we manifest? How does it work? Tell me!"

"The truth is, even though it's called the Seeing," began Yali patiently, "it's not much like seeing with my eyes. It's more like, sort of… holding very still, to <em>listen</em> for the future. And your manifesting is very… noisy. So it's hard to hear anything past what you're about to manifest."

"Oh! So – wait a minute, you just asked us to stop manifesting! So before that, you were <em>already</em> about to ask us to stop manifesting! So you shouldn't have seen us manifesting anything in the future! How does that make sense?!"

"I think, I think, maybe it's about the fact that it was <em>my</em> decision? I mean, I didn't decide to tell you until after I saw it, so maybe, maybe…"

"If the Farseer could reliably predict the results of the Farseer's own future decisions," Justicar cut in, "then what would happen if she foresaw a danger? Naturally, she would act to prevent the danger. But then the danger would never occur as she saw it. That would be a contradiction, so it follows that, <em>until</em> the Farseer has committed to a decision, she can still See the results of alternate decisions she could make." She looked to Yali. "Is that not so?"

"Something like that, yes."


????? [????? Someone asks about the difference between alchemy, sorcery, and manifesting]


?????




?????

"We are close to being able to travel to the five portals. But in order to visit them in sequence," said Justicar, pointing at a starmap, "we would have to go either <em>here</em> and then <em>here</em>, or <em>here</em> and then <em>here</em>. But in either direction, we would barely miss a transfer we need to complete the journey. And then the stars that would take us to the last two portals will not return until many days later."

"What if we split up? Me and Alchemist could go off together!" said Morrow.

"That…" Justicar frowned at the map. "That would technically work. But it is almost the least efficient way for us to split up."

So it was a transparent attempt for the other lovebirds to get some time alone. I was cool with that, especially if Justicar didn't like it. "Alright then," I said cheerfully, "him and Alchemist can go off together, AND me and Yali can go off together!"

"No." said Justicar. "We should all stick together. It is safer that way."

"You know, we don't have to do what you want us to."

"It is not a matter of what I want. It is a matter of what is wise."

?????

"This will be a lot like when we were pulled into the Otherworld. Just as the Waiting God put us into this layer, the Seeking God will put us into the next. So it will be similar, but different."

"Different how? What's it going to be like?"

"This is the Seeking God. If I told you what to expect, the god would do something else."
