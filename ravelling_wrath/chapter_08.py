"So," I said, summarizing the last hour of discussion, "the Alchemist is, like, infinitely far away. They broke their star, and it's not on the pattern anymore. We don't know if they did it on purpose. We don't know if they have any control over where it's going. And <em>we</em> have no way to get off the pattern to follow them, because what they did was probably an Alchemist power. And we have no way to communicate with them. And Yali's power is useless as usual, because apparently the Waiting God still think this is part of the challenge. And even if they <em>did</em> figure out where we are, and <em>could</em> move their star on purpose, they might crash into us really fast, because they don't have the pattern to slow them down at the right moment. It would be even worse than what happened with Morrow, because, uh…"

"Because Morrow was slowed down by air resistance. All of our bodies would be destroyed, hostile intent or no."

"Right, because there's air in space."

"Right."

?????

It wasn't anything like when Yali was using the Seeing. Morrow closed his eyes, leaned back, opened his mouth, and moved his tongue around.

?????

"Her? I thought you called the Alchemist 'he' earlier."

"I just say whatever feels right at the time!"

"Woah, so is the Alchemist, like, genderfluid?" I said. "Also, hang on, what's the Alchemist's name?"

"I'm in her mind!! Do people normally think about their own name??"

"<em>I</em> do," I said, smirking. "Every morning I wake up and say, 'Sure is a fine day to be Rinn Akatura!" I was exaggerating, but only a little.

"You should ask for his, or her, name," said Justicar. "So that we know what to call him. Or her."

Unfortunately for Justicar, Morrow was already [????? back to interacting with Alchemist]

?????


"So, now that you're here, what's your name? We've just been calling you 'the Alchemist' this whole time."

The Alchemist wobbled back and forth shyly.

"It's okay!! Rinn's a friend!" said Morrow.

The Alchemist hesitated. "Well I, maybe, my name? There are, a few different things people call me. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad? To just be the Alchemist? Do some alchemizing?"

"Alchemy," corrected Justicar. The Alchemist flinched.

"Technically," said Yali, "The Alchemist's ability to make potions <em>isn't</em> alchemy. It has more in common with sorcery."

"That is impossible," said Justicar. "The titles are given to us by the gods. They cannot be incorrect."

"Maybe what <em>we</em> know as 'alchemy' is called that because it's similar to what the <em>Alchemist</em> does, not the other way around. But in any case –"

"Oh my gods, you guys," I said.

"Everybody shut UPPPPP!" yelled Morrow. "Alchemist has something to say!!"

Alchemist smiled nervously.

"Are you, uh, sure about that?" I said to Morrow. "They don't seem to be –"

"I said shut UPPPPP!!"

"Okay, fine."

After a very awkward silence, Alchemist managed to psych themself up into saying something. "I – me? I can make potions?"

"It is one of the abilities available to the Alchemist," said Yali. "Once you learn how to do it, you should be able to store parts of the Broken God's power in a physical medium,

?????

"Now that were altogether – all five of us – we can…" I wasn't quite sure where I was going with this, but there is something that felt almost nostalgic about the five of us all being together and friendly with each other – or at least tolerating each other, I guess. There was an irritating doubt in the back of my mind, but for now, I just wanted to have fun. "Let's have a campfire! And then we can tell stories around the campfire!"

"We could also tell stories without setting anything on fire," said Justicar.

"Yeah, but then we wouldn't get to set things on fire." I dropped a pile of logs out of thin air onto the middle of the star. Then I took a big, exaggerated breath inwards, and breathed fire all over the logs. Alchemist startled. "Haha, didn't mean to spook ya!" I said. The logs weren't properly on fire yet, so I gave them another few fiery breaths until they caught.

"Now everyone sit around the fire!" I said. They all did, to varying degrees of reluctance. Yali and I sat on a camping mat, with Yali sleepily putting in one arm around my shoulders. On the other side, Morrow and Alchemist were in a similar position. Alchemist initially seemed nervous about the fire, but once they relaxed and started warming themself, their face melted into a dreamy smile. It was really heartwarming.

Justicar insisted on staying in a stiff chair a slight distance away.

"I'll go first!" I said. "This one's for you, Yali. I'm finally going to tell you the one about how I jumped out of my window!"

"This'll be good!" said Morrow, bouncing up and down. "Tell us tell us!"

"Alllllright!" I clapped my hands over the fire. "So this one time in elementary school I got suspended for punching this annoying kid – don't look at me like that, I was like nine. Nowadays I only punch people if they actually hurt somebody. Anyway, the day I was suspended, my parents grounded me up in my room all day. But the problem was, that day was the day of…" I paused for effect "…the BIGGEST afterschool dodgeball tournament of my ENTIRE life. There was no way I was going to miss that for something stupid like getting suspended. So when afterschool time came, I was gonna sneak out. Problem was, Dad knew my tricks. So Dad had taken a work-from-home day and parked himself right at the bottom of the stairs while he worked. There was no way I could sneak past him, because the stairs were the only way to get down from my room. <em>Or so he thought!</em> There was also… – somebody give me a drumroll here –"

Nobody gave me a drumroll. I thought at least Morrow would do it, but no such luck. So I just kept going.

"<em>…the window.</em> See, right under my window, there was a bunch of big bushes. And they looked really soft and leafy, so I figured they'd make a good landing. My window wasn't built to be able to open, but I took an old coin and unscrewed it from the wall. I was really careful with the glass, I put it down on my bed without making any noise. And then I jumped out. And, well… Yeeeeaaaaaah so it turned out those bushes weren't as soft as I thought."

Alchemist cringed.

"Don't worry, I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything. I just got some really bad scrapes. But the worst thing is, I didn't EXPECT it, so I screamed out when it happened. Like, if I hadn't screamed, I could totally have still played dodgeball that way. But –" I sighed "– Mom and Dad came running and I was totally busted. They patched up the bleeding and then didn't let me out of their sight for the rest of the day. At least I got this cool scar though!" I unmanifested half of my pant leg so they could see the long scrape on my knee. Alchemist covered their face. Morrow came around the fire to take a closer look and poke at it.

"Haha, that tickles. Anyway, there's more to the story. See, Mom and Dad had, like, a huge fight about it later. I think they thought I couldn't hear them, but they were really loud and I could totally hear them through the walls. Mom was like 'that was too dangerous, she could have gotten seriously hurt, we need to reinforce all the upstairs windows so she can never do that again'. And Dad was like 'that is Just Wrong, she is our daughter, that would be like putting her in a cage'. And I'm pretty sure they never came to an agreement about that. They just never tried to ground me in my room again, haha."

Justicar let out a tiny sigh.

"You got a problem with that? Bet you think I'm a total terror and they SHOULD have put me in a cage."

"I won't rise to your provocation," said Justicar calmly. "A child cannot be expected to understand the need for rules. I certainly did not when I was a child myself. And I cannot judge another person's family from a simple story. All I can say is that it is a parent's duty to provide rules to structure a child's life. It seems possible that they were not fulfilling that duty even before this incident."

"Yeah," I said sarcastically, "I feel so deprived of rules. What a tragedy. Oh woe is me."

"Stop fighting, you two!" said Morrow.

"Wait, <em>you</em>? <em>You're</em> telling us to stop fighting?" I said incredulously.

"You're making Alchemist upset!! All he wants is for everyone to just get along! And maybe to have some nice stories where people have a good time instead of everyone getting hurt and fighting each other!"

"Wait, so you can just read our minds all the time?"

"No, only Alchemist's."

"What."

"Ow'm I supposed to read those two's minds past how they're on guard all the time? All I've got from them is emotions."

"What about me?" I said.

"Oh, I don't NEED to read YOUR mind. I can already tell what you're going to do next."

"Oh yeah? What am I going to do next?"

"First you're going to deny it, then you're going to complain that it's not fair."

"No, I'm not."

"There's the denial…" said Justicar.

"Hey!" <em>That's not fair</em>, I thought, but this time my mind managed to get a step ahead. I shut my mouth instead. Yali chuckled.

?????

"Can the rest of you stop manifesting for a while?" said Yali suddenly.

"Sure, but why?" I said.

"It's the Seeing. It's –"

"Ooh! Ooh!" said Morrow. "Does it mess it up when we manifest? How does it work? Tell me!"

"The truth is, even though it's called the Seeing," began Yali patiently, "it's not much like seeing with my eyes. It's more like, sort of… holding very still, to <em>listen</em> for the future. And your manifesting is very… noisy. So it's hard to hear anything past what you're about to manifest."

"Oh! So – wait a minute, you just asked us to stop manifesting! So before that, you were <em>already</em> about to ask us to stop manifesting! So you shouldn't have seen us manifesting anything in the future! How does that make sense?!"

"I think, I think, maybe it's about the fact that it was <em>my</em> decision? I mean, I didn't decide to tell you until after I saw it, so maybe, maybe…"

"If the Farseer could reliably predict the results of the Farseer's own future decisions," Justicar cut in, "then what would happen if she foresaw a danger? Naturally, she would act to prevent the danger. But then the danger would never occur as she saw it. That would be a contradiction, so it follows that, <em>until</em> the Farseer has committed to a decision, she can still See the results of alternate decisions she could make." She looked to Yali. "Is that not so?"

"Something like that, yes."


????? [????? Someone asks about the difference between alchemy, sorcery, and manifesting]

[Rinn tells the story about jumping out her window]


?????

[????? I'm just breaking their concentration]

"????? – I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break your concentration!" Morrow looked around frantically, then jabbed his fingers at me and Justicar. "You two! We're going bottomside!"

"Why does Justicar have to come with us?" I said.

"He needs a break from all us extroverts!"

It took me a little while to realize what he was implying. "Wait, are you saying Justicar's an extrovert?!"

"Ssshhh!" Morrow half-dragged me over the edge of the star.

From behind me, I heard Justicar say, "Very well, I will accompany you. But I will not take such an undignified route." After a short while, a big metal staircase popped into existence near us. Justicar had manifested two staircases, one on each side of the star. The tops of the two staircases were joined together by a big half-circle walkway from one side of the star to the other. With a loud clank-clank-clank, Justicar walked up the stairs on her side, along the walkway, and down on our side. It <em>was</em> much more dignified than just falling around the edge. Then she sat down on her customary hard stool.

?????

"Will you <em>stop doing that??</em>" Morrow hissed at Justicar suddenly.

"Uh, she's not doing anything."

"I told you she's an extrovert! She keeps wanting to be closer to us! But then she SQUASHES it! Over and over again! I can't STAND it!" he spat.

"If you have a problem with the choices I make in what <em>should</em> be the privacy of my own mind," said Justicar, "it is not my responsibility to accommodate you."

Morrow was breathing hard, looking at Justicar with an anguished expression on his face. Normally I would have been happy to let him have a go at Justicar, but this was different. I didn't want him to do something stupid. "<em>Dude</em>," I said. I grabbed his shoulders and forced him to look back at me. "I can't believe I'm agreeing with Justicar, but if she wants to beat herself up, that's <em>really</em> not our problem."

?????

"By the way, are you gay?" I said. I'd kind of been assuming Morrow was gay based on how he acted towards me, but all the times he'd called Alchemist "she" had made me wonder. "I mean, I know you're into Alchemist, but that doesn't tell me much about in general, haha."

Morrow shrugged. "Gay is just who you fuck, right?"

"What? No way! It's about way more than that!"

[???? "How do you know [if you're gay]?"]

"Do you actually not know, or are you just messing with me?"

"What do you think?"

"I think you're just messing with me, but whatever, I'll tell you anyway.


?????

"We are close to being able to travel to the five portals. But in order to visit them in sequence," said Justicar, pointing at a starmap, "we would have to go either <em>here</em> and then <em>here</em>, or <em>here</em> and then <em>here</em>. But in either direction, we would barely miss a transfer we need to complete the journey. And then the stars that would take us to the last two portals will not return until many days later."

"What if we split up? Me and Alchemist could go off together!" said Morrow.

"That…" Justicar frowned at the map. "That would technically work. But it is almost the least efficient way for us to split up."

So it was a transparent attempt for the other lovebirds to get some time alone. I was cool with that, especially if Justicar didn't like it. "Alright then," I said cheerfully, "him and Alchemist can go off together, AND me and Yali can go off together!"

"No." said Justicar. "We should all stick together. It is safer that way."

"You know, we don't have to do what you want us to."

"It is not a matter of what I want. It is a matter of what is wise."
