It slammed into place. The pattern. The blazing, uncompromising pattern of the Stern.

I was crushed between iron walls. Manacles locked themselves around my bones and jerked me into place, leaving me immobile. Calipers poked at me from every side, measuring me in ways I didn't know I could be measured. Bars slid and rotated into position, squishing me into a different shape like I was a sack of putty being forced into a square hole.

I struggled to stay in my original shape.

<em>Wrong</em>, came the overwhelming force of the god. Every part of me that didn't fit the pattern was <em>wrong</em>. If it couldn't be squeezed into place, I should rip it off myself.

I twisted and fought, trying to get out. But when I pulled my arm against the manacles, it burned with pain and ?????. <em>This arm is betraying me. It is not a true part of me. I should rip it off.</em>
