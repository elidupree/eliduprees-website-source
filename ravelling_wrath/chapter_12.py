It slammed into place. The pattern. The blazing, uncompromising pattern of the Stern.

I was crushed between iron walls. Manacles locked themselves around my bones and jerked me into place, leaving me immobile. Calipers poked at me from every side, measuring me in ways I didn't know I could be measured. Bars slid and rotated into position, squishing me into a different shape like I was a sack of putty being forced into a square hole.

I struggled to stay in my original shape.

<em>Wrong</em>, came the overwhelming force of the god. Every part of me that didn't fit the pattern was <em>wrong</em>. If it couldn't be squeezed into place, I should rip it off myself.

I twisted and fought, trying to get out. But when I pulled my arm against the manacles, it burned with pain and ?????. <em>This arm is betraying me. It is not a true part of me. I should rip it off.</em>

?????

My body crumpled onto the floor.

Everything felt heavy. I had been dumped on a hard stone floor, surrounded by square walls of white marble. Above me, a dim orange glow filtered through a sky dark with clouds. The floor was painful under me, but I couldn't bring myself to get up.

What was even the point? If I got up, I was just going to have to go look for Yali. Again. How many weeks had I spent grinding through the Seeking God's puzzles, for only minutes of her? And now I was in the world of the Stern. It would probably make me break my back and never give me what I wanted at all. Why did the gods have to put me through this? I felt like a defeated, burned-out shell. I was never going to be with Yali again.

And even if I found her, what good would it do? She would just be taken away from me again. And again, and again, until the day I died. And then they would all walk over me.

That didn't make sense. I tried to shake my head clear. Was it the Blood God? Being mad that I hadn't killed Yali, I guess? That didn't quite fit either. Just in case, I tried to listen for the Blood God's will, the way I had learned in the last layer. But there was nothing. Emptiness. A hole inside of me.

I ought to get up, I thought. My back was killing me. I <em>really</em> ought to get up. But somehow, it just didn't happen. I couldn't summon up the motivation to move.

What had happened to me?

I have never felt like this before. Up to this point, the Ravelling had been… certainly an <em>interesting</em> experience… but I had basically felt the way I would normally feel about all of it. But this… I had never felt like this before in my life. Listlessly, I tried lifting up a hand and making a fist. It didn't even feel like my hand. The fist didn't feel kickass. It was just… <em>a</em> hand that happened to be connected to my arm.

I dropped my arm down to the floor again. If I didn't get to feel anything, what was the point of even getting up? Even the setting of my heart only felt like a distant echo.

I don't know how long I lay there. The moments stretched out into a trickle of agonizing time.

And then… it appeared.

It was a burning haze pressing in on every side of my mind. An iron pillar jamming into my soul, trying to force me up. A spear of anxiety and guilt, a driving need to do what I must. <em>I MUST get up. I MUST get up. I MUST.</em>

I didn't have to guess what this was. It was the Stern God.

Why was the Stern God allowed in my head? I didn't have the energy to question it. I had to get up. I ripped my tiredness aside. I yanked myself to my feet like a puppet. My muscles burned with the pain of being used before they were ready. They still weren't ready. I forced them to do the next thing anyway.

<em>I must [????? prepare in an obedient way],</em> I thought. I stumbled to the center of the room. In front of me, there was a pedestal with a uniform neatly folded on top of it. I was to put on the uniform before continuing. Across from me, two grim-faced, white marble statues blocked the doorway with their spears, waiting for me to obey.

?????

The uniform was made of ill fitting, stiff cloth that chafed at my skin.

[????? The uniform; make sure to clarify what happens to Rinn's phone]

?????

Normally, I would have fought against it, refused to [????? show obedience (bow down?)]. But now, I didn't even care anymore. <em>Joke's on you, Stern God, I don't give a shit.</em>

?????

[????? Setting out on the corridor]

Despite the rigid walls everywhere, there was no ceiling. Every room and corridor was open to the sky. I gazed up at the walls resentfully. Why couldn't I just climb up one of the walls and then take a shortcut across the top? But that was forbidden. I had to stay on my own path. I lowered my head again and kept walking. Wait, what the fuck? I was Rinn Akatura. Since when did I ever not do something because it was forbidden? Struggling to hold on to my own thoughts, I manifested a ladder and set it against the wall.

I took one step up the ladder, then another. Why was I climbing this way? It wouldn't work anyway. No, it was trying to make me forget! Stubbornly, I held on and kept climbing. Each step was harder than the last. Gravity weighed me down. I felt like my arms and legs were made of lead. With an earth-shattering effort, I forced my head almost up to the top of the wall. Just one more step, and I'd be able to see over the edge.

Terrible gravity slammed me down, breaking my ladder to splinters and crushing my body against the marble floor. I was face down, my jaw twisted to the side and my bones grinding against the rock, defying all my efforts to lift them. And moments after the pain began, my stomach churned with the horrible realization of how badly I had failed. A wave of guilt and anxiety threatened to drown me. I had done wrong, wrong, WRONG. And now I was being punished. I could not hide from the Stern.

Slowly, the gravity let me rise again. I dragged my leaden body to its feet, badly shaken. Could the Stern God just <em>do</em> that to me? When I thought of trying to climb the wall again, I shuddered and shied away.

?????

There was that word again – the Blood God's word, if you could call it a word, for the Farseer. Idly, I held the word in my mind. Thinking it over, I could feel that it was actually two separate ideas joined together. The first one was clear. It meant the Waiting God. I could tell because the "word" had the same feeling as what I'd felt when the Waiting God was pulling me into the Otherworld. But the second…

"Lask… ueh," I said out loud. It didn't sound anything like it sounded in my head, but it would have to do. Was it the word for a Raveller? No… the Farseer was <em>Waiting God laskueh</em>, but when I tried thinking of myself as <em>Blood God laskueh</em>, it made the Blood God angry. Justicar was <em>Stern God laskueh</em>, but Morrow wasn't <em>Seeking God laskueh</em> and Alchemist wasn't <em>Broken God laskueh</em> – they just weren't.

Thinking about this was a waste of time.

?????

I stared at the statues blocking the Alchemist's Path. I could feel the Stern God watching me with contempt. It had made sure I knew what was wrong to take a different Raveller's path. But it was going to <em>let</em> me do this, and let the mark of my wrongdoing hang over me.

?????

"Ugh, just get out of the way, you stupid statues," I said dully.

The statues lifted their feet and shuffled out of the way.

"What the fuck," I said.

?????

[????? After an eternity of trudging], the statues parted to reveal the intersection with the Farseer's Path. Oddly, she was standing right there, as if she was waiting for me. And there was… another person there. The Alchemist.

Something wasn't quite how I expected. Normally, when I saw her, I would run and hug her, right? I was supposed to love her? But that wasn't happening. She was just… A person. Over there. I didn't feel anything.

Disinterestedly, I started walking toward them. This <em>was</em> what I was supposed to do, right?

"Are you ready?" the Farseer asked the Alchemist tensely. "You remember what's about to happen?"

"I'm as ready as I'm going to be," said the Alchemist. They were gripping a potion tightly in their shaking hands. They looked absolutely terrified. That didn't make me feel anything either.

What were the two of them talking about? What was about to happen? Well, it didn't matter. I thought of opening my mouth to greet them, but it seemed like too much work. Dutifully, I walked up to where they were standing. I stared at the Farseer. The Farseer stared back.

"Rinn, can you hear me?" she said.

I was probably supposed to answer that. But I felt like there was something else I was supposed to do, too, that was more important, I just couldn't remember. What was it…?

Oh, right, of course.

I made a blade and stuck it into her body.
