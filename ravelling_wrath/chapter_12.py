It slammed into place. The pattern. The blazing, uncompromising pattern of the Stern.

I was crushed between iron walls. Manacles locked themselves around my bones and jerked me into place, leaving me immobile. Calipers poked at me from every side, measuring me in ways I didn't know I could be measured. Bars slid and rotated into position, squishing me into a different shape like I was a sack of putty being forced into a square hole.

I struggled to stay in my original shape.

<em>Wrong</em>, came the overwhelming force of the god. Every part of me that didn't fit the pattern was <em>wrong</em>. If it couldn't be squeezed into place, I should rip it off myself.

I twisted and fought, trying to get out. But when I pulled my arm against the manacles, it burned with pain and ?????. <em>This arm is betraying me. It is not a true part of me. I should rip it off.</em>

?????

[????? The uniform; make sure to clarify what happens to Rinn's phone]

[????? I was going to have to go look for Yali. Again. Frustration at the jobs, but feeling defeated, it probably won't work anyway?]

?????

[????? After an eternity of trudging], the statues parted to reveal the intersection with the Farseer's Path. Oddly, she was standing right there, as if she was waiting for me. And there was… another person there. The Alchemist.

Something wasn't quite how I expected. Normally, when I saw her, I would run and hug her, right? I was supposed to love her? But that wasn't happening. She was just… A person. Over there. I didn't feel anything.

Disinterestedly, I started walking toward them. This <em>was</em> what I was supposed to do, right?

"Are you ready?" the Farseer asked the Alchemist tensely. "You remember what's about to happen?"

"I'm as ready as I'm going to be," said the Alchemist. They were gripping a potion tightly in their shaking hands. They looked absolutely terrified. That didn't make me feel anything either.

What were the two of them talking about? What was about to happen? Well, it didn't matter. I thought of opening my mouth to greet them, but it seemed like too much work. Dutifully, I walked up to where they were standing. I stared at the Farseer. The Farseer stared back.

"Rinn, can you hear me?" she said.

I was probably supposed to answer that. But I felt like there was something else I was supposed to do, too, that was more important, I just couldn't remember. What was it…?

Oh, right, of course.

I made a blade and stuck it into her body.
