<h2>Chapter 2: The Ordeal</h2>

"Uuuuughhhh."

I rolled over and tried to flop out of bed. I had dreamed of a world of steel and stone, where a glaring sun pulsed like a heart. Now I was stuck back here in the real world, with... ugh. My bedsheets tasted bad.

I hauled myself up and stumbled down the stairs. Rubbing my eyes, I almost walked straight into my dad.

Dad sighed. "<em>Good morning</em>, Rinn."

We had a lot of rules that we didn't keep, but there was one that Dad always stuck to: <em>No arguing before breakfast</em>. From the look on his face, he was having a hard time keeping that rule today. But he managed it, and we passed by each other.

That was a relief. I went in the bathroom and washed up. It gave me enough time to think about –

Right. <em>Everything.</em>

There were gods and Ravellers and I <em>had</em> to protect Yali if it's the <em>last thing I do</em>, and stuff. I wandered back out and sat down at breakfast without looking at anybody. With all the thoughts spinning through my head, I wasn't that interested in eating either. I swallowed my food slowly, one bite at a time. I had this itching feeling that Dad was going to say something when I was finished eating. But maybe if I dragged it out…

In the end, he finished before I did.

"Rinn," he said pointedly.

I still didn't feel totally awake.

"Rinn…"

Guess I had to say something. "I was hanging out with Yali yesterday."

"We called you three times."

"I didn't notice." It was half true. Thinking back, I had heard my phone buzz a few times, but I'd been too busy with Yali to pay attention.

"Rinn, tell us the truth."

The mention of <em>telling the truth</em> made my mind snap into a frenzy. <em>Parents… tell nothing</em>, she'd said. Well what if – maybe it was better if they <em>didn't</em> even think it was the truth!

"Fine, I wasn't at Yali's! I was –" Stern take it, I was no good at making up stories – "You know what, never mind! It's not important!"

Dad looked like he was gearing up to say something else, but Mom touched his hand, meaning, "Let me handle this." Then she said, "Rinn, we can tell it was something serious."

"Oh yeah? How do you know that?!"

Mom sighed. "You slept through your alarm, and you've barely touched your food…"

I had... slept through my alarm? Never mind, I didn't have time to think about it. "I've eaten more than half of this!" I snapped back.

"Not if you count the snack you always have directly afterwards." I grimaced. Sometimes I hated being so easy to read. "Rinn… you <em>never</em> sleep through your alarm, and you <em>never</em> leave your breakfast half-eaten. So please… just tell us what happened. Are you in trouble?"

<p><em>Shit.</em></p>

It would be one thing if Mom was angry at me. She'd lecture me for a bit, but then it would be over. But if she was <em>concerned</em>… she'd never give it up. She'd follow me around and pester me about it and look over my shoulder when I was texting and then I'd say something careless and she'd find out and then there would be… there would be <em>bad futures</em> and I'd never see Yali again –

Mom must have seen that I was panicking. "Rinn, it's okay. We're not going to punish you. We just want to make sure you're safe."

A flash of rage swept over me. She could <em>say</em> that, but the Waiting God knew – literally, Yali had seen with its eyes – that I wouldn't be safe at all. And even if I didn't know that, Mom was always like this. Dad was simpler. He'd tell me the rules and get mad if I broke them. But Mom would do the whole "wink wink, nudge nudge" thing. Sometimes she'd even take me aside and say, like, "This is what the rules are, but just between us, this is how we <em>really</em> do things." But as soon as I relied on her for anything, she'd go straight back to law-and-order.

I clamped down on the rage and tried not to let it show. I didn't have time for that. If I didn't come up with some of thing to say <em>soon</em>, she'd know I had taken the extra time to come up with a lie. And then it would be just as bad as if I hadn't said anything. But what could I say that would make her stop worrying when <em>I</em> was worrying?

Finally an idea scraped out. It was rough, but I didn't have anything else, so it'd have to do.

"I'm not in trouble, it's not <em>me</em>, I'm just worried about –" no backing out now "– Yali. She's having a, uh, a personal thing. A crisis. But, see, I promised her that I wouldn't tell anyone, so –" I did my best to sound like I was uncomfortable about breaking the promise. It wasn't hard, because I <em>was</em> uncomfortable, just not <em>that</em> way. "– so please, just, don't mention it to anybody, okay?"

"Don't worry, sweetie, of course we won't. But is it –"

"I thought you <em>weren't</em> with Yali," Dad interrupted.

"We've moved past that," said Mom.

"What?"

"It was a lie," I said. Mom had figured that out, but she had an annoying habit of not explaining things to Dad when he hadn't caught up. "I panicked and thought I was about to break my promise, so I just… you know what, never mind."

"That was… misguided, –"

"I just got out of bed! You can't expect me to be, uh, right-guided about everything!" It was a relief to be able to just be annoyed about something I was actually annoyed about.

"Misguided, but also honorable. You thought you were protecting your friend's secret." I winced internally at "friend" – <em>we were dating, for gods' sakes</em> – but I had bigger things to worry about right now.

"Rinn," said Mom tiredly. She had put her hand to her forehead with an expression that said, "I can't believe you two". "What's happening with Yali? Does she need help?"

"I wish I could tell you, but I can't break my promise any further."

"That doesn't mean you can't tell <em>us</em>. We're your parents."

"I told her I wouldn't tell anyone! I can't go back on that! Dad, back me up here!"

Dad clearly didn't <em>want</em> to back me up, but he said, reluctantly, "Every promise is law before the Stern."

"I really, really can't tell you," I continued.

"Of all the days to get serious about the Stern…" muttered Mom. "Well. You can tell Yali, from us, that if she needs any help, –"

I gave an internal sigh of relief. Mom wasn't trying to press the issue. I could just say I'd give her message to Yali, and – Wait. I had to stick to my story. "But then I'd have to tell her that I told you, even though I said I –"

"Stern give me strength… Well. Just tell her, there <em>are</em> people who <em>would</em> help her, if she would just <em>tell</em> them what the problem is."

"Are you talking about her, or me?"

"Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to."

<bigbreak>

I met Layo at lunch that day. I gave our usual greeting, running up and giving him a big hug. He hugged me back and grinned at me.

"Hey hey, what's up?"

<em>So much</em> was up. I opened my mouth to start telling him all about – well, to tell him that I <em>would</em> have something big to tell him when we could talk in private. He was right there. All I'd have to do was open my mouth and say "Layo, I've got some big news, when can we talk?"

But... something stopped me. It was just too much to explain. It would take forever, and…

Anyway, I had something else on my mind. "Layo, what makes me mad?"

"Assholes?"

"No, what makes me <em>really</em> mad?"

"Really big assholes?"

"Serious question."

Layo paused. "I <em>was</em> joking, but that's honestly the first thing I think of. Why do you ask?"

"Never mind that, just – come on, you've gotta be able to come up with something better than that. You know I just don't put –"

"– just don't put up with people's you-know-what, I know. If that doesn't count, hmm..."

"Hasn't there been any time I've come to you just stewing about something?"

"If you have, I'm not sure I can tell the difference? There's been a few times when I <em>thought</em> you were upset for real, but when we –"

"You mean like when I get kicked out of the ????? club? You were acting all <em>empathetic</em> and shit –"

"Yeah, I remember you laughed it off like you didn't care. Not that I'm saying you didn't! I mean –"

I smirked. "Yeah, I pretty much didn't care about that."

"That's okay! I mean..." Layo put a hand over his chest. "If I think of what makes <em>me</em> the most upset, it's not that kind of thing either. It's more about, uh, my own flaws. I, uh, I get really jealous of people sometimes, and I <em>know</em> it's wrong for me to be jealous, and it just eats me up. So, if you… I mean, it might not work the same way for you! I'm not saying there's something wrong with you if you get –"

I internally kicked myself. I guess I'd asked for it, but I wasn't really ready to get into Layo-level introspectiveness. "Eh, never mind being serious," I said. "How about, like, pretend like we're in a movie. Like you're a supervillain and you have an evil plan to make me lose control, what is it?"

Layo swallowed whatever he was going to say next. I wasn't sure how he was feeling, but then he relaxed. "We-ell..." he said, like he was mulling over my question. "Obviously, I'd murder your parents right in front of you. Obviously."

"Hey!"

"Wait, I take that back. I forgot you're not on the best terms with your parents. Clearly I'll have to murder your girlfriend instead." Layo was on a roll with this. "And I wouldn't do it in front of you, because you'd kill me first. I'd do it somewhere else and then send you a video of it. And then I'd send you a heart emoji."

"You <em>monster.</em>" I dove at Layo and started tickling the shit out of him. He squirmed out of the way and tickled me back, and before long we had both stumbled and smashed into one of the lunch tables.

"Rinn Akatura! No roughhousing in the lunchroom!"

"It was my fault," said Layo immediately. A lot of heads were turning our way, not to mention the poor sods at the table we'd hit. I'd heard a glass of juice spill somewhere.

"I know perfectly well it wasn't. Rinn –"

"Leave her alone, lunch fascist!" said another voice. Some of my other friends were showing up.

"Everyone calm down," I said, laughing. I wasn't <em>against</em> yelling at a few authority figures, but I had better things to do right now. "I promise I'll clean it up, okay?"

"Just don't do it again." Heh. If they actually made me clean it up, I'd just end up making a bigger mess, and they knew it.

Dehel tried to keep yelling in my defense, so I covered his mouth and dragged him off towards the lunch lines. We all got our lunches and found an empty table to sit at. As I sat down, I was still grinning and catching my breath from the tickle fight. Between the food and the ????? playful arguing my group always did ?????, I almost forgot ?????.

<bigbreak>

But somewhere in the back of my mind, the idea of <em>murdering your girlfriend</em> had stirred a memory.

As soon as I had a moment alone in the halls, I pulled out my phone and started texting Yali.

<p class="text right">omg i love you so much can't want to see u &lt;3</p>
<p class="text right">u ok? from the you-know-what last night</p>
<p class="text right">anyway I thought of something that actually made me angry</p>
<p class="text right">its like</p>
<p class="text left">im ok</p>
<p class="text left">tell me after school</p>
<p class="text left">meet you out front?</p>
<p class="text right">sure thing &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

When I caught up to Yali after school, she didn't see me at first. She had her bags next to her on the bench, and she was sitting with her elbows resting on her knees, looking totally exhausted.

"Yaliiiiiiiii!!"

When she saw me, she stood up right away. I ran to her and hugged her fiercely. Then I pulled back and took another look at her. She was slightly smiling, looking like her regular self <em>now</em>, but… "No seriously, are you okay?" I said. "You looked like you were totally –"

Yali rubbed my shoulders. "Don't worry about me. We have things to do."

"Wait, which things?"

"You said you thought of a, a –" Yali fumbled for her phone.

"Oh yeah, the thing that made me angry? That was…" I glanced around, thinking about how to start explaining it. It was a kind of touchy subject.

"Not here," Yali interrupted my thoughts. "Let's not get into serious business while we're just standing around. How about I take you to ?????? My treat."

"I told you, I can't –"

"The one near ????? Square."

"Oh. Yeah. That'd be great!"

I took her hand and we started walking.

"You still haven't told me why you can't go to the one near the school," Yali said as we walked.

"Ugh, I don't want to tell that story. I was kind of irresponsible."

"Aww. I love hearing stories about you being irresponsible."

"You do?! I only wasn't going to tell you because you're always telling me to be careful and stuff –"

"I don't want you to get hurt <em>now</em>! But if it already happened – By the Stern, if I've missed out on four and a half weeks of fun stories because you thought I wouldn't like them…"

"You totally have! I have <em>so</em> many to tell you. This one, though… eh…"

"You don't have to if you don't want to," said Yali soothingly.

"Hang on, I just remembered this story <em>also</em> has a point in it where I got really angry. So it's kind of killing two birds with one stone if I tell it. Sure, I'll do it," I said. I danced a few steps ahead and then looked back, waving my arms like a stage magician. "The Adventures of Rinn Akatura, Chapter 752: The Fast Food Place," I began. "So, there was this girl –"

Yali smirked.

"Hey! I haven't told you the best part yet! I haven't told you <em>any</em> of the parts!"

Yali doubled over, laughing silently. I couldn't help laughing along a little bit. Then she straightened up. "Sorry. You can keep going now."

I let Yali catch up with me and held her hand again. "So, there was this girl I liked. I'm not going to say who it was, because I think she wants to forget about all this now, but anyway. I asked her out, and we had a good time, so we went on another date after that, and so on. Although they were less 'dates' and more 'me taking her to the movies or whatever so that we could make out for the whole time'. It wasn't a real relationship, we were just horny teenagers." That felt a little weird to say. "Ha ha, Waiting God knows I'm still a horny teenager. Buuu-uuut I'm in a real relationship now –" I squeezed Yali's hand "– and I'm fine if you want to take it slow."

"Uh... right," said Yali. "Go on with the story!"

"Alright! So I kept taking her places, but I'd never had much spending money, so I ran out pretty fast. So I got myself an under-the-table job working in the kitchen at the fast food place."

"Wow. How old were you?"

"This was a three years ago. I was like 13. Sure it was illegal and stuff, but whatever. That got me enough money to keep paying for 'dates'. Until… ugh, I feel really stupid about this next part."

"It's okay. I won't judge you."

I glanced around to make sure no one else on the street was listening. "Yeeeeaaaah… we got caught at the movies with our hands down each other's pants."

"Wow."

"And then like… word got around. And like, <em>I</em> can laugh off that kind of thing, but I guess it hurt a lot more for her. She's basically been avoiding me ever since then, and I don't even blame her, I feel like total shit for putting her in that situation. And then I lost a bunch of friends over <em>that</em> too."

"Did they drop you because of the rumors?"

"No, that's the worst part. None of <em>my</em> friends would have a problem with some wild stuff –"

"Right, silly me –"

"– but I had people trying to, like, <em>high-five</em> me for 'getting some action'. But that's <em>not</em> what <em>happened</em>! It wasn't <em>cool</em>, it was a <em>mistake</em>, I <em>hurt</em> someone! Someone I <em>liked</em>! So if anyone thinks they can <em>congratulate</em> me for that, like if they think that's what I <em>wanted</em> – just, <em>argh!</em>"

"It makes you really angry."

"Yeah! If somebody just says 'fuck you, Rinn' or whatever, I know where I stand with them, you know? But when people <em>act</em> like they're on my side when they're <em>not</em>... I basically just told them to fuck off. I wish I had come up with something smarter to say."

"Maybe we can use this. I can <em>see</em> you getting angry right now, more than we managed the other day."

"You're totally right." I hadn't even noticed, but my whole body felt charged up.

"You're hurting my fingers, by the way."

"Shit, sorry." I let go of Yali's hand. She shook it out.

"It's fine," she said. She looked at me curiously. "Before we get to the serious stuff, why don't you finish the story? You got caught in the movies, but what happened to the fast food place?"

"Oh, right. Well, I was kind of upset for the next few days, so I wasn't really paying attention, and I let a cop see me going in and out of the kitchen. He started to make a fuss, so we all pretended I was just there to visit a cousin who worked there. But they basically told me not to come back after that, to make sure they wouldn't get in trouble. Kind of anticlimactic, I know."

????

I noticed that Yali was still smiling at me. "I can't believe you actually liked listening to <em>that</em> story," I said.

"You have no <em>idea</em> how adorable you are."

"Okay but seriously <em>that</em> story? That story sucked."

Yali tried to make a more serious face. "I know it's <em>bad</em>, what happened. But there's just something about, about, about you being so… free to feel things. It makes me want to go with you on all your adventures. Even though when I actually think about it, I might be better off watching your adventures from a safe distance."

I smirked. "You know, if you ever want to go on an adventure –"

"No, I'm good. I can't wait to hear some more of your stories, though."

"Okay! Let me tell you one of actually good ones. Like about that time when I –"

"Just a minute. I really want to hear your stories. But the problem is, I'd love to spend <em>all afternoon</em> hearing them. And then we won't get to the thing we were going to do first."

"Which thing – oh yeah, the thing that got me angry. Way to pick out another downer," I said.

"Is it that bad?"

"Do you know name and name??????" I said quietly.

"I hope she dumps him already," Yali muttered.

"I know, right? He treats her like shit! And I <em>like</em> her. Not in a romantic way, just in an I-really-don't-want-anything-bad-to-happen-to-her way. So I can't stand it when I see him talking down to her. But that's not the <em>real</em> problem. Not the real problem for me, I mean. Or it wasn't at first. It was just, you know…" I paused, fishing for words.

"Just your normal. Your 'mad, but not <em>really</em> mad'."

"Yeah, that's it. But then…" I grimaced. "There was this one time when he was, like, pushing her around, putting her down in front of everybody, and I told him to stop it. But he just kept at it, like he was daring me to do something about it. So I kind of punched him a little bit."

"A little bit."

"Okay, fine, more than a little bit. But it's not like I put him in the hospital or anything. He was fine. But a couple days later, <em>she</em> came up to me in private and told me that he was acting really bitter about it, and he was dumping all the blame on her."

"Oh no."

"Yeah. She basically begged me to leave him alone, to make sure that wouldn't happen again. And I obviously couldn't say no to that, you know? She's the victim here. But now whenever I see them talking together, it's like… I'm so mad, but I can't <em>do</em> anything about it. I just <em>stew</em> about it, for, like, an hour."

"Only an hour? Not longer?"

"Hey! An hour is a long time! For me, anyway."

"I'm not judging. You can keep going."

"That's the whole story though. It just sucks." I idly kicked the leg of the table. "So… what do you think? Do you see any way we can use this? Seems hard."

"True. We probably shouldn't get me an abusive boyfriend in order to make you mad."

"Oh my gods, I can't believe you even thought of that."

Yali chuckled. Then she focused again. "These two stories have a lot in common," she said.

"They do?"

"Think about it. In both of them, you accidentally – Well, I was going to say 'accidentally hurt', but it wasn't <em>you</em> who hurt – actually, it was other people who did the actual hurting, both times. But you felt responsible. And both times, the person who got hurt was a girl you like."

"That… I guess they <em>are</em> really similar."

"And both of them… don't have any closure, and they end with you feeling like you don't know what you can do about it." Yali looked at me. "Would you say you felt… helpless?"

"Ugh, I don't want to <em>say</em> I felt like that, but I don't know… maybe? Why do you ask?"

"'Anger turns helplessness into strength,'" Yali intoned.

"Hey, is that a quote from somewhere?"

"We had a book full of sayings in the, the, when I was growing up. It was a really old book, so it still had some of the Blood God's sayings, from back when the Blood God was worshipped. That's one of them."

"'Anger turns helplessness into strength,'" I repeated, trying it out. "I can see that. I'm not sure it's always true, though."

"Same."

There was a pause. We ate a few more bites in silence.

"So," I began, "Where are you going with all this?"

Yali hesitated. "My idea is to, to, to <em>explore</em> your ways of feeling anger. So that we know what we have to work with." She looked at me squarely. "I want you to try to put yourself back in that situation. Feel all the pain and anger – or, no, feel all the pain and helplessness, and let it lead you to anger."

"Okay…" I thought back to sometime when ????? was shit-talking ?????. He was such a fucking asshole. ?????

"Eh..." I said.

"I saw you grimace for a moment there."

"Yeah, it <em>sort of</em> worked, just like those other times. But, like, it's in the past, right? I can't just get mad about it again just because I want to. Like, I'm here with you now, it's different."

"That's the problem… a…"

"A what?"

Yali didn't answer. She was deep in thought. I wanted to know what she was thinking, but I knew how she got when she was like this – if I tried to interrupt her, she'd just mumble something incomprehensible and then take even longer.

I finished my food. Yali finished hers and pushed her plate aside. She was still looking down in silence.

"So, are you going to –" I began.

"I've had an idea." Then she was quiet again.

"…okay, spit it out."

"It's, it's, I don't know if it's okay."

"Just tell me."

Yali fidgeted with her plate. "You are too comfortable. I've never seen you stay uncomfortable for very long. I don't mean physically, I mean, you always, whenever something hurts you, you always find a way to say, 'well that's no big deal'." Yali swallowed. "I wonder what would happen if you couldn't do that. What if I – we – put you through a, an <em>ordeal</em>, where you <em>couldn't</em> make yourself comfortable…"

"You can do that?"

"Maybe I can," she said gravely.

"Well now I'm <em>curious</em>."

"I can tell you what I'm thinking of –"

"No, don't tell me, I bet it'll work better if I don't know what's coming."

"You – you're acting like you're actually excited about it…?"

"Come on, ever since you told me yesterday, I've been wondering, what the hell is it going to feel like to have the fucking –" I glanced around to see make sure no one was listening "– <em>you-know-what</em> in my head making me angry all over the place? How <em>would</em> I handle that? So, this 'ordeal' you've got, I know it's not the same, but if it's going to be something like it, I want to see what it's like, sign me up, when do we start –"

Yali took my hand. Her voice was soft and serious. "Before we make plans, I want to make sure you've thought through whether you really want to do this. It's okay if you say no, or that I'm dragging you into things too fast."

"I'm fine with it. I literally <em>just</em> said –"

"Stop. Just this once, can I ask you to take some time and think it through? If this works, it'll be a really unpleasant experience for you. So I don't want to jump into it unless you're sure about it."

"How bad can it be?" I said. Yali stared back at me. "Fuck, I bet that's exactly what you <em>didn't</em> want me to say. Okay, give me a minute." I said. I looked down at the table. What was I supposed to do, though – think like a careful person? What <em>would</em> a careful person do in this situation? "Okay,



?????

Being denied food?

sure np

and I guess itd be annoying but

It doesn't need to anger you directly. Hunger will make you emotionally weaker.

Skip lunch today.

you coulda told me earlier &gt;_&lt;

I could have. But then you'd have been more prepared for it.

screwwww you lol

&lt;3

<p class="text left">One last thing. I plan to make you feel like you have no way out. But the truth is, you always have the right to back out of this. No matter what I say, if you say you don't want to do this anymore, I'll respect that.</p>

?????

As I got close to Yali's house, I all but forgot my hunger. I felt myself tensing up. I had no idea what was coming. I mean, we'd <em>discussed</em> all those things, but I didn't know what it was really going to be like.

I rang the doorbell.

The door cracked open. Yali's voice, tired and tense, came through the crack. "Come in. Don't touch me. Don't look directly at me."

I let myself in. I wanted to run straight to her and hug her, like I always did, but she'd said not to… "So, are you –"

"Shut up."

She said it so dismissively, like she didn't even care. She paced a few steps away from me. "I will torment you," she said, "until you're so angry that you are willing to punch me. That is your only way out of this ordeal. Now," she faced me again and pointed to her stomach, "punch me once for practice. Right here. So you'll know what to do when the time comes."

I made a fist, then hesitated. "Are you sure this is okay?"

"Just do it."

She was asking me to… But I couldn't punch Yali! I loved her! It was just <em>wrong!</em>

"Stop wasting my time."

I was frozen. I had to do it. But I couldn't. "I –"

Yali grabbed my arm and slammed it into her stomach so hard that it hurt my wrist a little. "There. Like that. Now you do it."

"Woah! You're gonna hurt yourself!"

"I'll do it again if you don't."

I – I couldn't let her get hurt. I swung my fist like she told me to, just not very hard.

"Fine," she said. "But that was pathetic. Now sit in the chair."

I stepped back and laughed nervously. "Ha ha, I know you're only saying this to make me angry."

"Sit down."

I <em>knew</em> she was only doing it to make me angry. But I couldn't stop a sickening doubt from creeping in. <em>Yali</em> wouldn't say that stuff to me, but… she wasn't acting like Yali at all. Her arms were slack, and all her movements were deadened. She wasn't reacting normally when I moved or spoke. And her voice was cold and flat, like when she had tried to make me mad on the first day.
