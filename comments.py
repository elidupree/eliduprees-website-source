(My social blunders were also constantly pointed out to me when I was younger, so I learned a few things from that...) With me, the thing was (is?) I wanted friends very badly, but was clueless about going about getting them. So, I looked to other people (who DID have friends) for guidance on how to act. I also hate conflict, and, although I hate to/am very bad at lying, if it comes down to it, I will lie in order to avoid conflict.<br/><br/>It really is easier said than done, though - it took me YEARS to learn how to effectively mimic neurotypicals, and I'm still not "perfect" at it (and by now, I'm not even sure I want to be :/ )<br/><br/>It's interesting though, I still don't really know how to tell white lies. For instance, say my friend is wearing an ugly skirt. If she explicitly asks me "do you like my skirt", it has gotten to the point where I can automatically say "yeah!" I am certainly not going to tell her that her skirt is ugly - I'm just not going to say anything at all. I cannot just say "I like your skirt!" of my own volition.<br/><br/>I'm glad you mentioned that people don't fit neatly into the categories of "placator" and "truth-seeker" - I guess at this point, I would fall more into the former category, by your definition, but by no means am I shallow or a liar.

  "contents":""""How to fit best" in isolation is fine, but the first half of the sentence goes "How to use the tools [long phrase describing tools]" &ndash; and if I write it "How to use best the tools", it's awkward because the reader has to take a moment figuring out that "best" modifies the word they've just read (and not just the word, but the whole infinitive "to use"). ("How to best use" doesn't have that problem, because "best" doesn't mean anything on its own, so the reader can easily intuit that "use" completes the infinitive.) And if I make it say "How to use the tools [blah blah blah] best", then it's even worse, because the trailing "best" changes the meaning of that whole half of the clause <em>after</em> you've read it. I <em>could</em> have written the sentence with a different structure entirely, but this structure works just fine, so I see no reason to change it.<br/><br/>

The reason we have the split infinitive rule is because English is derived from a bunch of other languages where an infinitive is a single word. If you thoughtlessly copy the grammatical principles of those languages, splitting infinitives looks like a weakness of English. But it's not: It's a <em>strength</em> of English! When I say "to best use", it's completely unambiguous that "best" modifies "use", while any other order has potential ambiguities &ndash; and not only that, since the infinitive phrase stands as a unit, I've created a whole new phrase to refer to the <em>concept</em> of using something best, without having to use any extra words to explain that concept! Look at this example:

<blockquote><q>I hate this job. I'm just going to botch my next task completely.</q> said one of them.<br/>
"Why do you want to badly do that?" said the other.</blockquote>

Sure, you probably wouldn't ask it that way, but it's just to illustrate the technical part of what I'm saying. If I write it "want badly to do", then "badly" modifies "want", which is wrong. If I write it "want to do that badly", then "that" stops being an object, and the sentence becomes like "Why do you want to do so badly?". In this particular case, "to botch" works better than "to badly do", because "to botch" is an existing verb that means the same thing, but English doesn't always provide such a convenience; there isn't always a word that has the same meaning as the concept you can construct with a split infinitive.""",

Putting the "best" in the middle of the "how to" makes the intended scope of the modifier really obvious, and if (like me!) you are used to seeing the phrase because you read a lot of things written in the no-split-infinitives style, it doesn't look funny.<br/><br/>"How best to" and "how to best" <em>are</em> slightly different, though. Your sentence as written feels better to me than when I hypothetically shove the bests one word to the left, I think because "how to best" fits better into your writing style, and the emphasis is slightly changed; the bests are stuck to the verbs instead of to the "how to" phrase, which means each of the two uses has more individual character instead of being more uniform.<br/><br/>^^^ And this is the kind of shit I think about all the time, given half an excuse.""",

Alecto actively sought out the Aurors' protection; ze probably grew up being taught that Aurors are there to protect zem, which suggests a relatively high status in society. Dawlish, Crouch, et al. apparently don't share that assessment of Alecto's status; they think of zem as a crazy person, and are willing to dehumanize zem because of that. I wasn't very specific about why in the comic, but "person with mental disabilities" was the angle I was thinking of when I designed Alecto.<br/>
<br/>
So when Dawlish was stationed with Alecto, Alecto didn't see any reason to be afraid of approaching Dawlish, and probably wasn't aware of what Dawlish would perceive as a threat, even if Alecto had the mental capability to censor zir behavior in that way. Dawlish, for zir part, was under a lot of stress from knowing that Harry might attack and believing (unfairly) that Alecto was a possible danger. Obviously, this didn't lead anywhere good.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know whether Alecto was actually involved in the torture scheme, and neither does Harry, since ze stopped to attack Dawlish before getting the chance to read Alecto's mind. To the other DMLE staff, the possibility of Alecto having committed these crimes reduces their sympathy for zem. To Granger, it doesn't matter; Granger genuinely believes in preventative justice rather than retributive justice, so zir feelings are unchanged by Alecto's alleged history.<br/>
<br/>
During this argument, Crouch probably accuses Granger of grandstanding, and/or having a personal grudge against Dawlish. Granger's reply is that ze is only interested in operating the most effective force possible, and that it is a liability to have an Auror who ignores policy (and who harms the office's reputation - although I'm not sure Granger would use that argument, because the others don't think of Alecto as the kind of person whose opinion about the office matters).""",

Fudge was the one who nominated Granger to the position in the first place, under pressure from everybody who knows anything about anything.

Fudge feels like that means Granger owes zem something, so Fudge is slightly irritated about Granger doing something that disrupts the "move along, nothing to see here" order that Fudge values.<br/>
<br/>
Shacklebolt doesn't like confrontation very much, so ze isn't saying very much. Ze supports Granger, though, because ze has a lot of respect for a person who has clear goals and is willing to fight for them. (Incidentally, my version of Shacklebolt was in Slytherin when ze attended Hogwarts.)<br/>
<br/>
Crouch and Thicknesse are sort of the antagonists here, but they're distinct from one another: Crouch has a strongly held ideology of "bad people should have bad things happen to them", while Thicknesse is trying to advance zemself and fulfill a role. Crouch thinks what Granger is doing is morally <em>wrong</em>, while Thicknesse opposes it because it's unconventional and inconvenient. (This is also why Crouch speaks in yellow and Thicknesse speaks in grey.)<br/>
<br/>
Amelia Bones happens to disagree with Granger about priorities; ze agrees that it's bad for Dawlish to violate policy, but ze thinks it's insignificant compared to the value of having Dawlish on the team. However, ze also thinks it's not usually zir role to interfere with the decisions of the Heads of Office; ze is more of an organizational leader than a dominant one.<br/>

If you're taking a class here you're getting taught the American standard, which is that the punctuation always goes inside the quotations. I prefer the British standard, where the punctuation goes outside if you're quoting a short phrase, but inside if you quote an entire sentence or series of sentences. I'll admit that my aesthetic has been influenced by computer programming, where the precise placement of punctuation matters - if you get the punctuation wrong you change the meaning of the code and it either doesn't run at all or it doesn't do what you expect.<br/><br/>Writing is all about reaching your intended audience. But there are some cultural biases there. In online forums, people quickly learn that forms of writing that look uneducated (rampant spelling errors, blatant structural problems in sentences) cause readers to dismiss what is being said. "Chatspeak" (the abbreviated words that are commonly used in text messages and IM) is trickier; in some online contexts it's the norm, in others it is frowned on.<br/><br/>College courses should make more clear what their cultural biases are and who they are teaching you to write for. The most common type of course is some form of expository writing; that one teaches you to write non-fiction for college papers and mainstream magazines. Science writing is another kettle of fish, and there you have to unlearn some of the standard expository writing stuff. (Scientific papers are very disengaged emotionally, usually written in the third person, and use passive voice extensively.) Writing fiction is yet another branch, but most students who aren't actually English majors will never take a class on that.""",

For "no means no" to work, people have to take control of their own sexuality and clearly communicate both what they don't want and what they DO want.<br/><br/>Where I part company a bit with some of the advocates is their insistence of verbalizing consent for everything. Non-verbal communication can be confusing, but sometimes it is also eloquent and unambiguous. The difference between someone who is acquiescing to a sexual act (or a non-sexual activity for that matter) and someone who is enthusiastically participating in it is usually obvious; it's the ambiguous cases where verbalizing the consent is important. Consider these two scenarios. First, you touch someone's crotch for the first time and ze passively lets it happen. Second, you touch someone's crotch for the first time and ze covers your hand with hirs and caresses it as you stroke. The first case is ambiguous.

<p>People almost always use verbal consent when they're proposing a board game. Why should sex, the context in which consent is most important, have more-lenient standards of communication?</p>

<p>I think the answer to why it does (not why it should) is that most people haven't developed their skills at using language to be able to talk about sex, and hence have more difficulty proposing things verbally. An analogy comes to mind: If you find yourself in a country where you don't know any of the dominant languages, then at first, you'll have to communicate using hand-signs (or an interpreter if you can find one). You can also try learning a local language; at first, that will be a lot more awkward, but the awkwardness is necessary in order to learn, and (if you're going to be there for a while) developing skill with the language is the most important thing. And with sex, you have the option of waiting until you're good enough at language before you try anything that could hurt someone.</p>

<p>I'm also totally into pre-arranged consent things &ndash; in your example, if you and your partner both think that nonverbal consent is hot, then it's valid to verbally agree that you're both okay with it. If you do that, then when one partner does something that ends up getting an "ack no!" reaction from the other, you can step back and say "okay, renegotation time" rather than having it be super yucky. (And it's always possible to push someone's "ack no!" buttons, even when you try to lay out boundaries clearly in advance. So it's even more likely if you don't.)</p>""",

<p>If we recognize that our cultural biases are making us give a piece of writing less credit than it deserves, shouldn't we use that knowledge to teach ourselves to give it the proper amount of credit, rather than to tell other people how to write?</p>

<p>As to the "quotes and punctuation" thing, the British standard isn't computer-sciency-elegant either. The computer-sciency-elegant way is for the quotes and everything inside them to function as a single unit &ndash; so if there's punctuation inside the quotes, that punctuation has <em>no effect</em> on the structure outside the quote, and if you want to quote someone as having used punctuation, it must appear inside the quote.

I'm not sure how arrangement of quotation marks and punctuation is important to a philosophy (or political science, or music, or history of feudal Japan) course, except that certain inconsistent or imprecise methods could make it hard to tell if the punctuation was quoted - and 'formal' English doesn't help with that.<br/><br/>When I look at Eli's definition, though, it occurs to me that the Philosophy professor will likely be less comfortable with anything but 'formal' English. This means that anything else is less effective at communicating ideas (or getting grades, if that's the goal), and thus less <em>good</em>. Perhaps instead of being upset that the school requires 'formal' English, I should be sad that none of the relevant professors speak any of the other, more expressive, languages.<br/><br/>Rereading the above, I retract the suggestion that professors are unable to speak other languages.

The most benign thing is this: Your bias will make it harder for you to recognize when a chatspeak-speaker turns out to be intelligent.<br/>
<br/>
A nastier thing is if you tell other people to use standard English instead of chatspeak. Doing that makes your community more elitist/cliquish; it says "If you want to participate here, you have to follow our customs instead of your own". And if you say "it makes you look less intelligent", you're just reifying your own biases, since the only reason it makes people look less intelligent is that a lot of intelligent people are elitist enough to reject it in this way.<br/>

<br/>
It's true that lots of people have that bias, and that an individual might want to study formal English in order to navigate other people's biases more easily; I have no objection to that. Having it as a requirement is yucky, though.<br/>
<br/>
From a more practical perspective... As an "introductory course" that functions as a prerequisite? If a student enters college without the ability to express ideas clearly through writing, that's unfortunate, but these English Composition classes are a little more than a band-aid for that. When your students have a wide variety of different levels of formal-English skill, and you dump them all into the same class, the professors have to compromise between the needs of all their different students, which makes the class inefficient for all of them.""",

Second, there's a lot of circumstances that are certainly important enough to justify it. Any oath of office could be an Unbreakable Vow, which would eliminate most corruption in [the Aurors / the Wizengamot / take your pick]. And why imprison someone in Azkaban (which is both escapable and expensive to maintain) for a major crime when you could instead force them to take a Vow that they will never again knowingly commit a crime?

Native American children were forcibly "adopted" by institutions not unlike boarding schools, which punished them for attempting to continue the so-called "savage" habits, traditions, and language of their native culture, taught them English, and otherwise expected them to just magically catch up with the education and habits of American(U.S.)-raised children of the same age. While one might say that doling out punishments for being too "Muggle" would be against the etiquette (if not the actual rules) of 1990s-era Hogwarts, teachers such as Snape and Umbridge are given more than enough free rein to punish Muggleborns for accused insolence or ignorance to their (the corrupt teachers') hearts' content.<br/><br/>As for the success of muggleborns, I have these responses to those that you listed (don't worry, I'm only justifying Hermione and Riddle, and I shouldn't have to say that to keep you from assuming that this is a pro-Rowling tract. Warning: I'm using gendered language for all characters referred to as such by the author):<br/><blockquote>Harry- He was actually mostly average, on average, and I have long been weary of people citing Harry as a successful student (though I will admit that you didn't refer to him as a successful student, just "successful at Hogwarts"). It's unrealistic to believe that he could have become an Auror given the scholastic requirements, but it's possible that there are setups in place that allow a sufficiently high score on the practical exam (or a sufficiently biased proctor or grade-marker) to surpass this. On the other hand, he really did have natural talent in a couple of his classes, and did sometimes (often?) stoop to cheating off of Hermione or a marked-up Potions textbook in other classes.</blockquote><br/><blockquote>Hermione- She got all of her schoolbooks nearly a year before the start of term (most pureblood families probably waited until the end of summer before first year), and had immersed herself in the culture of learning long before she found out she was a witch. While she couldn't use a wand at home, pureblood children aren't allowed to do magic at home either. Some families (such as the Longbottoms, and Molly but not Arthur Weasley) seem to actually respect that rule, and theory is shown to be just as important as practice in many parts of magical study (more important in purely rote classes such as the entirety of History of Magic). The "culture of learning" thing mentioned above is also a bigger advantage than it would be in most of Muggles' so-called first-world civilization, considering the vast majority of wizards tend to take the spoon-fed lessons and low-hanging fruit of knowledge as everything they need without doing much in the way of critical thinking of individual study (outside of the near-completely ignored Ravenclaw house, which is suspiciously lacking). In addition to that, she worked <em>hard</em> to stay ahead of the curve. She happened to be powerful for her age, but not outside of the implied normal deviation (that being, most of her skill came from memorization and understanding of theory).</blockquote><br/><blockquote>Lily- I'm chalking that one up to author favouritism. There's no real reason for her to be a prodigy, but she is one, and "author favouritism" fits the pattern of how Rowling tends to treat her as a character.</blockquote><br/><blockquote>Tom Riddle- It's a combination of a little of the same and a lot of the opposite compared to Hermione. He spent his summers in Hogwarts when all students with family went home, where there was nothing to do but explore or study. That's the "same" part- he had more reason and time to study compared to the other students. The "opposite" part is that Tom Riddle was an <em>incredibly</em> powerful wizard, and had been practicing wandless magic for what could have been years before he was eleven, focusing what the administration would falsely call "accidental magic" in ways that would not be possible for even many seventh-year students.</blockquote>""",

I thought J K Rowling did that on purpose so that she wouldn't have to deal with Harry losing relationships back at home, so that it was logical that he'd just be happy at Hogwarts because anyplace would be better than his home environment. Harry and Tom Riddle have that in common in the books.<br/><br/>As for Hermione, I always wondered why she never mentioned any friends at home. I wondered if we were supposed to assume that she didn't fit in at home because she's so interested in reading and learning. In the first book, Hermione doesn't really make friends until after the troll incident, so maybe we're supposed to assume she didn't have many friends back at home. And if we do assume that, then Harry, Tom Riddle, and Hermione are all entering the school without having that support system from home in the first place, so not being able to tell anyone wouldn't be an issue. But there is a general sense of "Hogwarts is the awesomest place in the world," that is shared by everybody - absolutely no one seems to be homesick or have issues adjusting to the new lifestyle or missing their friends from home, even though it's logical that muggle-born students especially would have these issues. And I think you're right that there would be an achievement gap. Hermione is smarter than most, but Harry definitely would have struggled more. And how could he be the youngest quidditch seeker of the century when the wizard-born kids grew up riding on toy broomsticks?""",

That's how I think about most things that I'm willing to do. For example, say I have to drive a long way to see a friend. I may wish that they lived closer, but I don't really get frustrated by the drive because seeing my friend is worth the drive to me. I felt the same way even when long drives were really stressful for me. <br/><br/>But when I have to do that same drive for another reason, like going to class or to an interview, then it frustrates me because I don't really enjoy class or interviews and the drive doesn't feel worth it. Even if the interview will benefit me in the long-run, it's not an immediately enjoyable activity so I get frustrated at the drive because I don't really want to go.<br/><br/>I think the problem here is that a lot of us do feel like we have to do things, like graduating from college. You manage to not get frustrated at anything because if that insect really made the class not worth going to, you'd stop going. But I wouldn't - I would feel like I had to stay in the class even if the insect actually made me unwilling to stay, like the insect wasn't a good enough (or socially acceptable enough) reason to quit. <br/><br/>I think this is why I sometimes have trouble commiserating with other people - because to them, the class is still worth taking with the insect in it, and to me, it's not worth it. I'm staying even though quitting is the better option for me.""",

Not just with other people's behavior, but I noticed a huge change in the way I talk about things once I was in a situation where I had less privilege/social power. I used to make blanket statements about things - if I personally loved something, I would just say, "This thing is awesome!" and I would keep repeating that even if someone told me that it was not awesome for them. I made a lot of generalizations and wasn't good about listening to people. <br/><br/>Then I entered a really bad situation, a situation that was a dream come true for most of the people in it, but a living nightmare for me. When I tried to tell people how bad things were for me, they invalidated my feelings just like I used to invalidate other people's feelings. They would make blanket statements about something being awesome or fine or at the very least acceptable for everyone, and I was *constantly* correcting them, saying, "No, that's not true for everyone because it's not true for me," but I apparently did not count as a real person because they would continue to believe these universal statements. <br/><br/>Ever since that happened, my own language changed completely. Not at first - when I was in the center of the storm, I tried to fight back by pushing my own reality back on people as a universal truth. And I will still do that a lot when someone is pushing their reality on me. But when that's not going on, when we're just talking, I am a lot more aware of not making universal statements about things. Now I will try to say, "Thing A was awesome for me because I love Thing B," and acknowledge the fact that everyone does not like Thing B.  I used to make universal statements, but ever since I experienced what it was like to not be in the majority, I've started doing the opposite. I'm currently working on a book about validating people's feelings/experiences, and I talk a lot about trying to make statements about yourself rather than the world.
