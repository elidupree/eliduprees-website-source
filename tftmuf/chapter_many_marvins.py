[Chapter break – "And This Is What Your Life Would Be Like If…" Times 200]

At this point, my story skips forward a bit.

You see, <em>I</em> wasn't the Marvin who had to build the initial duplication device. For <em>that</em> Marvin – who we later came to call Marvin Alpha – there were weeks of grueling work, [programming, building, keeping tabs on our prisoners and collaborators]. But for me, [I experienced only a few minutes of time from when we reset the original time machine to when Marvin Alpha and Kayla Alpha stepped out of it, to invite us into the future as their duplicates.]

As best I understand it, [Marvin Alpha had a terrible time/as soon as the adrenaline ran out, he had a mental breakdown/he couldn't concentrate on the engineering and locked himself in a room hiding for subjective days/Kayla Alpha had to yell at him to get back to work/he had a huge fight with Kayla where they both said hurtful things to each other, which he later deleted the recording of because he didn't want the rest of Marvins to be tempted to listen to it.] By the time he picked me up, he was barely holding it together. And he never wanted to be duplicated himself. We only duplicated the Marvins who started out like me, [not having had the crash yet, so that it could be made easier for them].

[Detailed narration of the initial duplication, with the "Kaylas arguing, Marvins hesitating" "this is painful to watch!" Thing]

And then my story skips forward <em>again</em>.

[You see, in the <em>first</em> timeline, the little group of us went on to start working together, establishing a little community and starting work on less janky time machines. And before long, they went back to duplicate another copy of the little group, so from the perspective of the second batch, right after they experienced being duplicated by Marvin Alpha, they experienced the little group of them being duplicated again, by the members of the first copy of the little group. But I wasn't in the second batch, either. Or the third, or the fourth. By the time they collected the batch that included <em>me</em>, there were already about 200 each of us. A community with policies. The Marvin and Kayla who picked me up looked much more [not haggard], and they had a much more professional-looking time machine]



[Being led past the bunch of Marvins who are hanging out, cuddling and playing video games]


He actually called it "onboarding", as if we were a tech company, and not [basically the SCP foundation].



[Onboarding: new Marvins are required to rest for at least a week, they can start getting to up to speed but can't work; each Marvin gets a new name/designation, chosen from a list of not-yet-used options; at some point the debriefer offers a hug, with discussion (dialog or narration? Maybe narration?) About how they experimented with the most effective way to get new Marvins comfortable with it]

[Here's your approved fidget toy. It works for us and it's quiet. I know you like clicky fidgets, but it turns out we can't stand the noise when we're not the ones making it.]

[Probably mostly narration rather than dialogue: Here's your time travelling personal alarm. Here's a practice version, see it's labeled "practice" in orange writing, because it's impossible to get used to it without practice because you never remember pulling it. It has a camera in it, and when you pull the real one, it sends the last X minutes of recordings back in time by Y minutes and broadcasts an alert. If you ever see a Nochli in person, you need to pull it immediately, to make sure the Nochli doesn't see you first. It's also supposed to go off automatically if you die, although we haven't been able to test that one. Kayla volunteered but the ethics board said no. [It takes a bunch of force to pull] yeah we don't want it to go off by accident. We made them just the right amount of force so that Kayla can pull one using her full strength.



[When PoV-Marvin is being debriefed: "and we've only had a few time travel mishaps". I'm sure for [the debriefer] this felt like something to be proud of, because they had been programming for umpteen person-months, and only had a few mishaps. But for me, who had just recently [ranted about unit testing, thought about how I would do stuff reliably], it was like all my planning had immediately been rewarded by "haha, you failed anyway!". "A few mishaps?" I exploded. "????? [Every single mishap could immediately end the world as we know it]]




[debriefer warning Marvin about what could happen with Kaylas ("don't try to stop her from deleting herself"); video of "kayla going to delete herself"]

[We call it "Kayla Management". Don't worry, Kayla knows that we call it that, she actually approves of it. She said it was a form of 'instrumentality' –]

"Instrumentality?"

"Apparently, that's something from feminist philosophy. It's [a form of objectification where you treat someone else as a tool to achieve your goals, literally an 'instrument'. And I thought she was criticizing me at first, but she was actually approving of it. She is instrumentalizing herself, she wants both of us to use her as efficiently as possible]



[You could technically try eating meat now because we're duplicating it, so it doesn't increase the amount of animals being mistreated? I mean, if you still think it's wrong, I respect your beliefs –/stop it! What if my beliefs are wrong, then you'd be respecting something that's wrong! You have to form your own opinion]




"We want to recruit an expert on Formal Verification."

[Marvin [not me] was presenting to the Ethics Board. This Marvin had an air of knowing what he was talking about – he was good at making professional presentations – he must have practiced a lot, because I wasn't that good at this]

?????

[Why should we approve this]

"[To prevent a mishap that would alert Nochli to our activities]"

[Reginald: "yes, of course it's [to defeat Nochli], that's the justification for EVERY request. You have to justify why [it is worth the risk of alerting Nochli that comes with every outing], and why there isn't a safer alternative that can accomplish the same goal."

[Marvin had a presentation for this]

["Based on our expected rate of software development that we will need, for plans that have already been agreed upon, we project [pointing at graphs] that the total amount of lines of code written will be 400000, resulting in 400 bugs and 80 additional time travel mishaps. With an estimated 3% chance of alerting Nochli for each time travel mishap… If we don't make drastic improvements to our programming practices… the projected probability of humanity's defeat due to software bugs is… 92%."]

[Having a powerful statistic like that does wonders to make a presentation more convincing. In business, people are always asking for money, and usually it's a hard sell, where even if you know that something is a good idea, it's hard to prove it to the stakeholders. But "92% chance of ending the world as we know it" did not leave much room for doubt. Everyone at the table was stunned. "Well," said Reginald, obviously struggling to maintain the polite decorum. The atmosphere in the room had clearly switched from "Marvin needs to convince Reginald" to "Reginald has a problem and is helping Marvin will have a solution". Reginald started asking about formal verification]

[it's where you mathematically prove that your code is correct. With unit tests, you can guarantee that the code behaves correctly in the situations that you thought of testing. But when the code goes into production, there's always going to be situations that you didn't think of. With mathematical proofs, you can guarantee that]

[Isn't that too good to be true? Why doesn't everyone do this?]

[Because it's difficult, takes a long time, and only a few people know how to do it. We've been following industry best practices for testing, like they use that big tech companies like Google and Microsoft.]

[Why can't Marvins do this?]

[Some of us tried learning, and hired tutors as usual. But frankly, we aren't mathematicians. Next to regular programming, formal verification is like learning a whole new language. Kaylas might be able to do it, because she learns faster AND maintains a higher time ratio, but she's starting from 0 programming knowledge – getting a Kayla that point would take weeks of global time; we've estimated that getting a Kayla to equal Marvins' level of programming skill would take around 6 subjective years, and, there are, ah –" he glanced at the Kayla who was sitting on the ethics board]

"– unresolved challenges with extending a Kayla beyond 5 subjective years," said Kayla crisply. She looked like she was [about 21, and thus, near the end]. No doubt, she wanted to [nip this topic in the bud] [so as not to have it be the topic of debate] "We are working on improvements to Kayla Management. But there are no guarantees."

[We're talking about having this mathematician actually understand all of the time travel rules. For every additional person we bring in, we need to consider the risk that they will later make their own time machines. And turn Earth into Salnthu. How are you going to make sure that doesn't happen? Are you planning to lock them up for the rest of their life?]

[I joked that plenty of mathematicians would be happy to be locked up doing mathematics for the rest of their life]

["[It is not appropriate] for you to joke about [abuse] when you are in a position [where you could actually commit it]!"]

[Kayla talks about vetting them]

[There was some more debate, but the overwhelming necessity may be outcome inevitable – the ethics board unanimously approved the proposal. This really was something that couldn't be hired out without revealing what it was for, because defining the properties you needed to prove required you to understand the system]


[amusingly, the mathematician actually WAS happy to be locked in a room doing mathematics all day?]


[The process of writing proofs promptly finds dozens of bugs, which makes Marvin very uneasy ("When would this be over? this thing of constantly being one mistake away from ending humanity?"). The mathematician is quickly in high demand by many Marvins.]

[Bunch of stuff about developing new time travel devices, including paradox traps, and how the formal verification plays into it]



"I would have thought fighting aliens would [be like action/suspense movie stuff], not just having a mental breakdown in an office"



Detective Kaylas were scary.

[When they where in our base, they always travelled in groups of three, constantly talking to each other in a mixture of English, Spanish, Mandarin, and their own private language that was meaningful only to Kaylas, developed over years of time spent together in the isolation rooms, studying everything they might need to know for the task. (Spanish and Mandarin were both commonly spoken in parts of the city and surrounding regions, so they were useful for detective work.) They didn't like to talk to Marvins, or even other Kaylas; they knew they were running out of their personal productive lifespans, and they coped with it by focusing on the work.]

[Here's how Detective Kaylas were developed: first, several Kaylas spent 4 subjective years studying to be the perfect detectives, and then they burned out. So they made duplicates of who they were only 3 years into the process; the resulting individuals did about 2 subjective years of fieldwork, which felt more productive and so they were able to get up to the full 5 years total. The vast majority of Detective Kaylas we interacted with were duplicates from after 1 year of fieldwork, so that they had learned from the mistakes of the first year of fieldwork without introducing any more risk by potentially making the same mistakes again.]

[When they were in the field, they were still in groups of 3 – not physically grouped, because of the risk of Nochli or an ordinary human seeing 3 duplicates together, but talking to each other over earpieces, constantly checking in to discuss risk, notice if the one in the field was burning out, and have the ones who were back at base do research in short time loops to advise the ones who were in the field how could work most efficiently. And whenever the one in the field started to get more careless, getting close to burning out, the others would recall them, delete them from existence and replace them with a fresh copy.]
