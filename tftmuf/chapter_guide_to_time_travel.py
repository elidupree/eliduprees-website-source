[Chapter title: Marvin Fitzroy's Simple Guide To Time Travel]

1.

Let's start with the simplest case of time travel. Marvin gets in the time machine at 2 o'clock and goes back to 1 o'clock. This creates a <em>second timeline</em>. In the first timeline, of course, there was only one Marvin; nobody got out of the machine at 1 o'clock. But in the second timeline, while the first Marvin is still standing around, a second Marvin gets out of the machine.

The second Marvin doesn't want to cause a paradox, so he leaves. Thus, the first Marvin gets into the machine, the same way he did in the first timeline. The only difference is, this time, there's <em>already</em> a Marvin who got out at 1 o'clock. So instead of going back in creating a third timeline, the machine <strong>synchronizes</strong> the departure with the arrival, and the timeline continues. More on "synchronization" later.

2.

But what if the second Marvin <em>did</em> want to cause a paradox?

Here, the second Marvin finds the first Marvin and tells him not to get in the time machine. When 2 o'clock arrives, no one gets in. That's a paradox. But what stops both Marvins from continuing to exist?

Well, one other thing is different in the second timeline. When the second Marvin arrives, the time machine also receives a memory of the history that was reverted. The time machine is <em>expecting</em> that the departure from the memory will happen, at the same time as it did before (from the machine's perspective). If it doesn't, the time machine <strong>resets</strong> the world to how it was in that memory, with just one change: the time machine now remembers that the departure was a <strong>failure</strong>.

In this case, it forms a third timeline that's a copy of the first. In this third timeline, the first Marvin gets in the machine… and nothing happens. He figures the machine must have malfunctioned or something. If he knows these rules, then maybe he suspects that he caused a paradox, but he doesn't learn anything about what the paradox was.

It's lucky that failures just mean nothing happens. Ethel says the physics would be just as consistent if the time traveller got deleted from existence.

2b.

...so Marvin tries again at 3 o'clock, thinking "I'd better be careful not to cause a paradox this time", goes back to 1 o'clock again, and leaves.

In the fourth timeline, the first Marvin once again attempts departure at 2 o'clock. But this time, the time machine has already received a memory of the third timeline, where he failed. His new attempt <strong>synchronizes<strong> with the failure from that memory. Thus, the machine doesn't even try creating a fifth timeline where there might be a paradox; it's already decided.

At 3 o'clock, his new departure <strong>synchronizes</em> with the departure from the third timeline. The fourth timeline is now canon.

3.

So how do you make a stable time loop?

Here, Marvin spends two hours brute-forcing someone's password – trying random passwords until he gets it right. At 3 o'clock, he gets in the time machine and goes back to 1 o'clock, so he can just text himself the password instead of doing all that work.

In the second timeline, the first Marvin receives the password right away. Of course, he still has to get in the time machine by 3 o'clock – otherwise [this will get <strong>reset</strong>.]

He could try getting in the time machine at 3 o'clock, like the first time. But it won't work! His memories are different than the original, so the new departure attempt won't <strong>synchronize</strong> with the original departure. It'll cause a <strong>reset</strong>, just like in scenario 2.

So instead, he gets in the time machine at 2 o'clock. Again, he goes back to 1 o'clock and texts himself the password at exactly the same time. Since the first Marvin is the same in the third timeline as he was in the second, the 2 o'clock departure <strong>synchronizes</strong> and the third timeline becomes canon. The process of synchronization makes the time machine forget that any departure ever happened at 3 o'clock, so 3 o'clock can now pass uneventfully.

3b.

…of course, it's hard for a human to get the timing exactly right. That's why we use scripts – it's more reliable to program a computer to send a message at an exact time. (If you're a programmer, you might be thinking, "but even a computer won't be <em>exactly</em> the same!". But it's close enough [that the "same as last time" will will take care of it].)

Here, Marvin messes up the timing. The 2 o'clock departures don't synchronize, so we <strong>reset</strong> back into the second timeline; in this fourth timeline, the first Marvin experiences a <strong>failure</strong> at 2 o'clock.

Luckily for him, he can still make a second attempt. He tries again right away, and succeeds, making the fifth timeline canon.

If he keeps failing all the way until 3 o'clock, then the 3 o'clock departure will get reset; [we'll be back with a failure in the first timeline. But he can still try again].
