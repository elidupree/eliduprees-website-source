being god was hard work.


[kayla: "i look at all of these people doing good things and evil things to each other, and think, how pointless it was to judge them … none of their decisions mattered. us, discovering time travel, had infinitely more effect on them than any of their good or bad deeds" [except stuff like murder, i guess?]]


[maybe: moments after the protagonists see the nochli ocean structure, nochli strikes ontoh from below the earth, to wipe them out because their existence is an existential risk]
[or maybe: the protagonists start duplicating ontoh to advise them in the war, and worry about the existential risk that creates]
[or maybe: nochli gloats to ontoh, or even without that, ontoh gets really upset about having lost? i'm not sure if either of these are in character anymore (given the new nochli backstory and "engineered to be perpetually slightly distressed "thing), but it would still be interesting to see ontoh's reaction. perhaps we can get a recording of it even if they get wiped out?]

[not 100% sure whether i want to use this: shortly after they see the nochli ocean structure, a nochli approaches pov marvin, having sabotaged all of the nearby paradox traps using tiny insects and blacked out any windows to avoid being observed; Marvin pulls the personal alarm but nothing happens; "you're not the only one who can use paradox traps," said Nochli gently; Nochli butters up Marvin ("I'm impressed with what you've achieved") and claims to be willing to coexist in peace, as long as they minimize existential risk by making sure not too many people are freed of the huvith (and if too many people are freed, then Nochli will be forced to wipe them out). Nochli comes off as being like the forthright, trustworthy Nochli from before they became alchiia (because that's the appearance that would be appealing to Marvin's). Marvin is getting convinced, because Nochli is using time travel to be convincing. But in the middle of the conversation, Nochli gets shot to pieces and 3 Kaylas march in to rescue Marvin; "but he wasn't trying to hurt me, he was just talking!" (Kayla to another Kayla:) "this Marvin is compromised, we have to take them to the less secure base with the other compromised Marvin's"; while they take him there, they try to talk him out of it ("what do you think Nochli would do if they wanted to get you to sympathize with them? Isn't that exactly what you just experienced?")]

[The horror and philosophy of "what if the majority of our futures are being captured and abused by Nochli?"; Ontoh would say that you should live your life as if the future that matters is the only future (if you can't really do anything to affect what happens in the takir futures, but you can advance your interests in the un-captured future, you should do that). Ontoh might not be available right now (either killed by Nochli or restricted access because PoV-Marvin is compromised) but someone can represent their perspective]


[[Description of the Nochli ocean structure, as seen from a long way away] I never actually saw it in person. Even the other Marvin's didn't go close to it, the entire war was conducted with robots because the combat made a huge radius around it inhospitable to life]



I instantly thought of her as "General Kayla". Her proud bearing, the way she was seated [like in a captains chair"]

[But the real dramatic thing about her, was,] She was <em>old</em>.

The oldest Kayla I'd ever seen. She had spent lifetimes preparing for this. [What does it take for someone my Kayla to live all the way to old age, while remaining who they are? You can't get that old by continually forcing yourself – it will kill you first. For a typical person to get that old, they basically give up on their youthful idealism, softening themselves to avoid burning out. But Kayla had taken a third path: she had made sophisticated policies for how to maintain both her brain hardware and her ability to act with the same level of dedication when it counts.]
