[Kayla: "I look at all of these people doing good things and evil things to each other, and think, how pointless it was to judge them… None of their decisions mattered. Us, discovering time travel, had infinitely more effect on them than any of their good or bad deeds" [except stuff like murder, I guess?]]



I instantly thought of her as "General Kayla". Her proud bearing, the way she was seated [like in a captains chair"]

[But the real dramatic thing about her, was,] She was <em>old</em>.

The oldest Kayla I'd ever seen. She had spent lifetimes preparing for this. [What does it take for someone my Kayla to live all the way to old age, while remaining who they are? You can't get that old by continually forcing yourself – it will kill you first. For a typical person to get that old, they basically give up on their youthful idealism, softening themselves to avoid burning out. But Kayla had taken a third path: she had made sophisticated policies for how to maintain both her brain hardware and her ability to act with the same level of dedication when it counts.]
