[Kayla: "I look at all of these people doing good things and evil things to each other, and think, how pointless it was to judge themâ€¦ None of their decisions mattered. Us, discovering time travel, had infinitely more effect on them than any of their good or bad deeds" [except stuff like murder, I guess?]]



I instantly thought of her as "General Kayla". Her proud bearing, the way she was seated [like in a captains chair"]

[But the real dramatic thing about her, was,] She was <em>old</em>.

The oldest Kayla I'd ever seen. She had spent lifetimes preparing for this. [What does it take for someone my Kayla to live all the way to old age, while remaining who they are?]
