 [Not really sure about this, but writing a while it's in my head:]
 
 
 [PoV Marvin unexpectedly finds Reginald waiting in PoV Marvin's room office;
 
 [Reginald, not upset, but serious] We need to have a conversation, as I have had with all Marvin's
 
 Marvin: oh, [kind of awkward because Marvin respects Reginald (partly as an authority figure) and also feels guilty about what happened to Reginald but also feels like Reginald is going to be judging him] what is it?
 
 Reginald: Kayla. I respect the agreements that we have made [during the time skip, they agreed to have equal numbers of Marvin and Kayla, and Kayla agreed not to destroy humanity without due process], but I am not happy with the fact that half of our agents sincerely believe that we would be better off wiping out all of humanity, even if she has agreed not to. I could not live with myself if I didn't do everything I can to make sure that this does not come to pass.
 
 As things stand at the moment, you are the only one with the physical ability to hold her in check. If the time comes that she decides humanity needs to be destroyed, we are depending on you to stop her. You must take this seriously as one of the duties of Marvins
 
 [I really didn't think Kayla was going to destroy humanity, and I didn't want to think that she was going to]
 
 [does this conversation happen after Marvin becomes Kazon? "You don't understand Kayla. She doesn't break promises." Reginald, somewhat surprised: "I've had this conversation many times, but that's the first time you've spoken to me so confidently. I hope that you are correct. However, that doesn't take away the obligation to be a failsafe"]
