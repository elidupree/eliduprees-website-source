[I didn't dare approach Fuller myself, but maybe, while he was distracted by the others – I (fished in my pocket? Went for the backpack?), With the rough idea of texting one of my previous selves]

But Fuller saw me move. "<em>Marvin</em>," he said warningly.

And there was one thing Fuller excelled at. [Maybe: he wasn't good at security, he wasn't good at X, but,] recognizing people's weaknesses. He knew I was afraid. He didn't even turn to face me, but kept his eyes, and his gun, focused [steadily] on Kayla – because he didn't need to. He knew that a single word, spoken with a stern voice, would be enough to freeze me in place.

In the social game, it was <em>Kayla</em> – no matter that she was unarmed, no matter her physical weakness – who was dangerous to him.

[Fuller making some clever words about science to demoralize Kayla, saying that the deaths and kidnapping were a small price to pay for the advancement of humanity]

[To my dread, it was working, Fuller knew how to get under her skin]

[But then Aster interrupted. "Science? You're the worst scientist I've ever worked with. I could have gotten this far with way fewer deaths, and less than 1% of your budget, years ago. Half our experiments have just been redoing stuff you already did because your experimental design was crap. You wasted your time perfecting mind control while ignoring the ones of us who wanted to get to the bottom of why it was happening. We lost 2 whole years of progress because you wouldn't believe me that [Billy] didn't die from [cyanosol]"

"[So sue me] for not believing the memory of someone with a memory disorder"

Aster took a step closer. "Precisely <em>because</em> of my memory disorder, I've always kept physical notes, even before we started recording on camera ????? the bag of cyanosol was still full ????? surely there would be some conclusions to draw from the physical evidence, for a great scientist like yourself?"

[Aster was trying to goad Fuller to take the attention off Kayla. Now it was Fuller's turn to start losing his composure. He yelled back, but now that his performance of authority had flickered, I couldn't see him as anything but pathetic]

[A couple more lines of argument, Aster gets close enough that Fuller points the gun at them, and then Kayla rushes him]




"Lock the doors! Lock every door in the building! We'll sort it out later –"

[Shouldn't we be going back in time?]

"[If there's someone, or something, following us] Right now is the ONLY time when we know where they are! [They were just in the experiment room, they are either there or kidnapping Marvin]" [maybe Marvin and Ontoh can have been promptly trapped in the experiment room, actually?]

"[Aster, where can we get more of the antidote that's least likely to have one of them waiting there?]"






["it's, uh, I can't tell you because you won't be able to understand"]

[But ?????. I had spent a lot of time watching myself on camera in the last few days, and I'd learned more about my mannerisms than I had ever wanted to. So I very precisely recognized the tone of voice he was using – the tone of being excited to have realized something – in this case, excited to have thought of a plausible excuse



[Description of Ontoh's voice]



[Again mention the quality of Ontoh's voice]

"If you were from the main timeline, you wouldn't be angry. You would be laughing at me for being defeated so easily."

[Chapter break (The Future They Made Us Forget?)]

[I'm not your enemy, I'm not even any danger to you. If I thought you were my enemy, I wouldn't even be talking to you, I would have self-destructed as soon as I saw that you were in control?]

[You killed a room full of people!]

[Yes, I have the ability to do insignificant things like that, but I've heard of you, and you still exist]


[What the hell are you?]

[I am a branch of Ontoh, the first true immortal human, one of the five ruling lineages in the main timeline. Physically, I am an immortal human head piloting one of Nochli's transport-boxes.]


[The one you should be worrying about is our mutual enemy, the one who created your timeline and put us all in this situation. The one who bred the symbionts you call the 'phrenochondria'. <em>Nochli.</em>"]

[The "ch" was pronounced like in the Scottish <em>loch</em> or the German <em>nacht</em>, making it less like "notch-lee" and more like "NA-hlee". "ˈnɑ.xliː", if you know IPA.]



[Have you looked out any of the south windows since you freed yourselves?]




[We're not calling it the main timeline. What's it called in your language? Salnthu, and your world could be named after the changes Nochli made, particularly the 'phrenochondria', which Nochli called '?????', meaning 'a fence to keep livestock from wandering out of the field', so your world would be '?????nthu']

[M: so we're basically sheep, then?]

[K: I'm not calling my world that]
