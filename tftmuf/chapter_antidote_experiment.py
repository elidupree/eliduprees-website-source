[The plan: they go back in time, schedule a failure message to themselves, and then go to do the experiment; if successful, they cancel the failure message. Thus, in the case of success, the originals perceive the same thing as the new-originals (no message), but in case of failure, the new-originals see the failure message, check what happened, and do a stable time loop to fix it. For the experiment, the plan is for Aster to show up with the current Kayla shortly after the original Kayla escapes, pretending that they've just recaptured the original Kayla, and pulling rank to change the experiment, pretending it's on Fuller's instructions; unbeknownst to them, one of the assistants get suspicious and messages Fuller to ask if it's legit, at which point he goes for the time machines (maybe with the idea of stopping Aster before they start, or even just showing up immediately after the message instead of with a delay]


[They're sitting in the "backup" room when Marvin's scripts detect Fuller coming. They rush out to stop him and just barely catch him running in the door to the time machine room; they rush in after him, but then find him standing next to the time machine, pointing the gun at them]

[Chapter break – It's Not Dying If You're Still Alive Afterwards? I Would Lay Down My Life for the Cause, At Least Temporarily?]



"Why isn't he shooting us?" whispered Kayla.

But my eyes were already going to the gun, [to the missing magazine. It was a good thing I was there, because only I, the one who was experienced with guns, knew what to look for. He had grabbed it in a hurry, not bothering to reload] "He has only one shot," I whispered back.

Kayla and Aster exchanged a look [and both stepped forward, spreading out]

To my horror, I realized what they were doing. [If Fuller shot one of them, he wouldn't have any shots left, and then the other 2 of us could rush him, then go back in time so this never happened. If you were willing to sacrifice your own life, so that another version of you would go on…]

[Fuller and Kayla yelling at each other to surrender?]

[I didn't dare approach Fuller myself, but maybe, while he was distracted by the others – I (fished in my pocket? Went for the backpack?), With the rough idea of texting one of my previous selves]

But Fuller saw me move. "<em>Marvin</em>," he said warningly.

And there was one thing Fuller excelled at. [Maybe: he wasn't good at security, he wasn't good at X, but,] recognizing people's weaknesses. He knew I was afraid. He didn't even turn to face me, but kept his eyes, and his gun, focused [steadily] on Kayla – because he didn't need to. He knew that a single word, spoken with a stern voice, would be enough to freeze me in place.

In the social game, it was <em>Kayla</em> – no matter that she was unarmed, no matter her physical weakness – who was dangerous to him.

[Fuller making some clever words about science to demoralize Kayla, saying that the deaths and kidnapping were a small price to pay for the advancement of humanity]

[To my dread, it was working, Fuller knew how to get under her skin]

[But then Aster interrupted. "Science? You're the worst scientist I've ever worked with. I could have gotten this far with way fewer deaths, and less than 1% of your budget, years ago. Half our experiments have just been redoing stuff you already did because your experimental design was crap. You wasted your time perfecting mind control while ignoring the ones of us who wanted to get to the bottom of why it was happening. You damaged our most valuable test subject by the gross negligence of letting her be undernourished. We lost 2 whole years of progress because you wouldn't believe me that [Billy] didn't die from [cyanosol]"

"[So sue me] for not believing the memory of someone with a memory disorder"

Aster took a step closer. "Precisely <em>because</em> of my memory disorder, I've always kept physical notes, even before we started recording on camera ????? the bag of cyanosol was still full ????? surely there would be some conclusions to draw from the physical evidence, for a great scientist like yourself?"

[Aster was trying to goad Fuller to take the attention off Kayla. Now it was Fuller's turn to start losing his composure. He yelled back, but now that his performance of authority had flickered, I couldn't see him as anything but pathetic]

[A couple more lines of argument; Aster stepping close enough that Fuller feels threatened]

Everything happened in an instant. [Aster was close enough that Fuller finally had to switch to them; he tried to keep it disciplined, swiftly sweeping the gun from one to the other. But the moment he began the movement, Kayla charged. She didn't waste time going for a kick or a grab – she just slammed her frail body into him at full speed, coming in past his guard so the gun was pointing uselessly into the air. They crashed to the floor with the sound of [equipment] and a high scream as it triggered Kayla's neuropathy [which of course she had known about and done willingly – much later, she told me what she'd been thinking in that moment, how she'd read that big part of martial arts training, like when you're doing a karate chop, is training your body to use your full strength when you would normally hold back to keep from getting hurt, so she just turned off her inhibitions against hurting herself. "You just turned them off in your brain without any practice?" "Yes. If you know what you're trying to do, why would you need practice?"]]

[A split-second later, Aster realized how the situation had transformed and what they needed to do. It was surprising to see, since they had clearly never been cut out for aggression. But they rushed forward to help Kayla, and as Fuller tried to recover himself, struggling to push Kayla off of him and get back control of the gun, Aster stomped on his wrist]

"Marvin! Grab the gun!" Kayla screamed.

"…Right!" [It had taken a bit longer for me to be shocked out of having been frozen, but Kayla's words achieved that. I ran forward to do the thing]

[Heart beating hard; panic; but having seen the other Marvin handle the gun before shooting Fuller, firearms handling was fresh in my mind. I remembered how my father had taught me: "if you ever, ever have to pick up a gun while emotions are running high, that is the easiest time to make a mistake and kill someone you care about, and the most important time to focus on all of the details of safety". I crouched, careful to take it with a steady grip with my shaking hands, and then stepped away from the scuffle.]

[It looked like Kayla and Aster were winning. I stood on the other side of the room, knowing that my most important duty now was to keep control of the gun and keep it away from the fight]

[They duct taped him to a railing, I think]

[Kayla asks about the thing about [Billy], and Aster tells her how he died just before the experiment, when they had only put in an IV with saline]

"Give me the gun."

["I haven't taught you to handle guns in this timeline/[apprehensive] what are you going to do?" "I'm going to kill Fuller obviously"]

[Marvin refuses to hand over the gun or kill Fuller ["I can't be responsible for this"? "We've already got him on the ground, we don't have to do this"?]]

["Fine." She turned and stalked towards him]

[Fuller knows what's coming and tries to beg for his life, completely losing his composure – "[[listen to Marvin], you don't have to do this]? I'll do anything you want, I'll let you go, I [release you from whatever hold I have over you], I have lots of money, I'll give you money, I'll give money to whatever charity you want –]

She kicked him in the side of the head.

The human body can withstand an incredible amount of punishment, but when it fails, it fails suddenly and unglamorously. I don't know whether Fuller would have survived even her first kick. [His eyes unfocused, his sentence stopped in the middle without even a panicked raise in pitch near the end. [Discuss the potential for internal bleeding, and how that could be fatal even from just one unlucky hit, how you need to be really careful about head trauma even if someone seems fine] But she didn't stop there. She kicked him again and again; I had to look away; she only stopped when she was physically exhausted]

[Kayla still perpetually angry]

[I wanted to distract her/give her an outlet to get out of the obsessive state she was in –] "Was [Billy] important to you?" I said gently.

["He was just some random kid!"]

[Something like: "But I thought, since, uh, you got so upset when you heard," "that's not the problem!" "What is the problem?"]

[Kayla explains: she was sick of them testing things on her and, because some of them were just clear liquid in IV bags, she started swapping things with saline whenever she could get away with it. So [Billy] was probably killed by one of the things they were trying to test]

[Aster laughs, seemingly oblivious to the trauma, "oh, so THAT'S why he died! I always wondered" [admiringly:] "you single-handedly set back our research by years"]

[...meaning that Kayla WOULD have been killed, but [Billy] died in her place.]

"It's not your fault,"

["You're just telling me that because you don't want me to feel bad!"]

["Of course it's not my fault! It's HIS fault! [Wait, what are Kayla's actual beliefs here? "Any violence carried out by the oppressed as a reaction to their oppression are primarily the responsibility of the oppressor?" except, at least the younger Kayla would not be inclined to divert responsibility from people who eat meat (contributing to the systematic abuse of animals), even though it's effectively foisted on them by society. And the present Kayla's main difference is that she has more cynicism ("a GOOD person would choose not to eat meat, Ring of JG's style, and the fact that most people do it anyway, means that humanity is largely corrupt, but I no longer spend my effort blaming them because I don't know what can be done about it"). I guess the difference is about what a good person would do – "obviously a good person would be strongly motivated to stop eating meat once they understood", while in the "harm another captive to protect yourself" scenario, it's not obvious that a good person wouldn't do that (maybe because of more equal ratio of harm to benefit – with animals, the animal is harmed by you eating it much more than you would be by not eating it). Maybe Kayla should go through some of this logic out loud (she's very upset, and moral philosophy is her coping strategy)]

[Marvin tries to pull some resolution out of that (à la "the important thing is that it's over now"… Maybe "but it's over now, Fuller's dead, right? We're not going to time travel and make him come back to life, ...right??") only to be interrupted by:]

[They get the text from future Kayla: maybe "My phone buzzed; I wanted to keep reassuring Kayla but she told me to check it in case it is important" or "I checked it" or "Kayla checked her phone". Regardless of which, "wait a minute, these are our future selves, the ones doing the experiment? They are not supposed to contact us, doesn't that mean they've just put us in a paradox?"]

[The text message was one word long:]

"Help".

[Chapter break? - Something like "Making Decisions Based on Unknowable Evidence"? Or something related to ability to trust a future self who was coerced?]

["Well if we're already in a paradox, there's no reason we CAN'T look at them [on the cameras]"]

What we saw was the scene of a massacre.

The bodies of all the assistants were strewn around the room. Some of them had vomited; one of them was slumped over a toppled medical cart, as if they had tried to cling to it in their final moments. [Whatever had happened, it was nothing like the silent, unsettling way Kayla and Aster had died from the "kill phrase"; one of them was still twitching on the ground, struggling for breath.]

Of all the people in the room, only Kayla and Marvin were still alive. [And, contrary to our plans, it was Marvin who was on the cot, with the IV in his arm, and Kayla who was standing to the side. Only when we reviewed the footage later did we notice the details – how Kayla already had the bandage and her arm, how she had already received the treatment before administering it to Marvin.]

[My head swam. I sank back in the chair, trying to process what I was seeing. "Jesus Christ, what happened to them?" Watching numbly; both Kayla and Marvin were terrified, and as we watched, Kayla's body begin to jerk violently. She collapsed to the floor, dying like the others.]

But the Kayla next to me [intense focus on the screen, neck leaning forwards?] "Lock the doors! Lock them in the room, right now!"

"W-what?"

What I didn't have, that Kayla did, was Kayla's knowledge of herself. She knew that if the experiment was simply going to kill everyone in the room, the other Kayla would have no reason to message us, because she could simply allow the prearranged failure message to arrive. So if she messaged us for help, that meant a completely different form of danger, one that would need a response from us <em>immediately</em>. And our Kayla already had a guess of what it was.

"It's in there with them! The thing that was following me! Lock it in!"

"S-shouldn't we just copy down the footage and go back in time? So we have time to figure out –"

"Right now is the ONLY time when we know where it is! This is our chance to trap it –"

"But –"

"Do it," said Aster, the most serious they'd ever sounded. "If she's wrong, we can sort it out later."

"O-okay." [It was hard to type with my shaking, sweaty fingers, ; couple more details of the process]

"And change the password! Change the password so Marvin can't unlock it again!"

["But he's me, why would –"]

"He's not supposed to be [getting the treatment]! He's been mind controlled!" [She wasn't quite correct [he had only been coerced] but it was close enough]



[Shouldn't we be going back in time?]

"[If there's someone, or something, following us] Right now is the ONLY time when we know where they are! [They were just in the experiment room, they are either there or kidnapping Marvin]" [maybe Marvin and Ontoh can have been promptly trapped in the experiment room, actually?]

"[Aster, where can we get more of the antidote that's least likely to have one of them waiting there?]"




[The other Marvin tries to get through the door, obviously in distress; Marvin can't resist using the security cameras to talk to him. "You need to let me use the time machine!" "What's going on? Why?"]




["it's, uh, I can't tell you because you won't be able to understand"]

[But ?????. I had spent a lot of time watching myself on camera in the last few days, and I'd learned more about my own mannerisms than I had ever wanted to. So I very precisely recognized the tone of voice he was using – the tone of being excited to have realized something – in this case, excited to have thought of a plausible excuse

"Marvin, you need to turn off that [video feed] right now! You keep [spacing out], you're clearly seeing/hearing things you can't see, I don't want you to get distracted or die." "But what about needing to watch them?" "Watch the outside of the door!"

[I did that; time passed; Kayla started taking the antidote in the chem lab; the terrifying apprehension of what would happen with either Kayla+Aster or Marvin+monster]

["I've listened to the kill statement and I'm still alive, please come over here and take it yourself, I need your help to make sense of this" ("understood the kill phrase but don't understand the implications")]

[Kayla took over watching the experiment room (I guess seeing Ontoh, but not talking to them, so they don't know they can be seen yet), while I ran to the chem lab; Kayla probably mentions that there is something very bizarre to see there, adding to Marvin's curiosity]

[Maybe if it hadn't been in such an high-stakes situation, I would have worried more about things like "possible permanent changes to my personality", but right now I was desperate to understand what was happening to us. Running high on adrenaline, barely noticed the pain of the needle being inserted as Aster helped inject me]

[Opening the file labeled "kill phrase DO NOT PLAY THIS.ogg". The somewhat low-quality sound recording, "so you can understand everything now? If I tell you that you can use time machines to duplicate human beings, do you understand me?" "What do you mean, time machines can duplicate human beings?" And then: Why is "you can duplicate yourself with time travel"-ish the kill statement??]



[Ontoh was physically a rectangular box on crab legs, with the Pattern all over the box – a much more vivid and precise version of the pattern (paragraph hook talking about "the true pattern"?)



[Description of Ontoh's voice; Ontoh immediately tells a bunch of lies to convince them they have to let Ontoh out of the room; probably, Marvin is worried that it's true, but Kayla isn't buying it, because she trusts the other Kayla who called for help; Kayla convinces Marvin by pointing out how it's way too convenient, and do you seriously think there's any way we can risk letting that monster out of there? [they could also ask if Aster can understand it, and if Aster can, it's not true]]

[Okay we have to do something! High-emotions reasoning/argument about how to deal with this]


["So the plan is:
– write a program to autocapture Ontoh at the scheduled moment and set up a stable time loop causing the experimental group to go back and run the program themselves; we go back in time and run that program the first time
– to make sure the timing of Ontoh following the experiment group is exact, make sure they have the exact same history as the FIRST experiment group, by not having the program tell them to do the loop until after they've taken the antidote, and…
– Wait, how do we know whether the first experiment group experienced Fuller going for the time machine or not?? What if we go back, and Fuller still hears of the experiment, but the first experiment group DIDN'T experience that, so now they have a paradoxical history and get reset again, undoing our work in capturing Ontoh (because the new instance of the experiment group may have different timing)? Or what if they DID experience Fuller going for the time machine, but it was because of actions by Ontoh?

[They use the cameras to figure out exactly how Fuller heard about it – getting texted by one of the assistants. [Cross-reference: preestablish that Marvin accesses the cameras exclusively through methods that record which camera data was accessed]]

["argh, we have to come to a decision before the hostage Marvin comes up with something!" Maybe the hostage Marvin calls the police, creating time pressure? "The only way to be sure the first experimental group doesn't cause a paradox is if we delete/replace them and make US the canonical version. How is that not a paradox? Because we can replay all of the cameras we've looked at and replay the text Fuller received! Then everything from OUR perspective will happen the same way in the next iteration. But then they won't be there for Ontoh to follow… We have to pretend to be them! Repeat all of their actions! That's the only way we know what Ontoh would do (otherwise Ontoh might hang out in the corridor for too long, which is a bad place to capture them)". Narration: Maybe if we'd had more time to think, we would have come up with a less risky plan]



[The horror of pretending to have a normal conversation while you can see the monster out of the corner of your eye but have to pretend that you can't see the monster; explicit dialogue (repeating what the experiment group said) where they mention they are going to go upstairs to do the experiment]

[They have gotten ahead of Ontoh, wait for Ontoh to follow and then lock all doors adjoining the corridor at once]

[Marvin turns on the 2-way communication and yells at Ontoh like "you're trapped, don't you dare try anything", voice breaking, clearly terrified of them]

[Again mention the quality of Ontoh's voice; this time it has a resigned/aggrieved tone]

"If you had grown up in the main timeline, you wouldn't be angry. You would be laughing at me for being defeated so easily."

[Chapter break (The Future They Made Us Forget?)]

[(Dripping with the attitude of "of course I've lost,", humiliated-ish but also finding it tiresome that they don't acknowledge it, which is extra humiliating because how did I lose to someone THAT ignorant) I'm not your enemy, I'm not even any danger to you. If I thought you were my enemy, I wouldn't even be talking to you, I would have self-destructed as soon as I saw that you were in control?]

[You killed a room full of people!]

[Did I? Well, yes, I have the ability to do insignificant things like that, but I've heard of you, and you still exist] [I'm happy to cooperate in any way that will help you to believe that I'm not going to attack you again, because that will just waste your important time]

[Marvin orders Ontoh to go into a small storage closet (unlocking the door to let them through, and locking it again afterwards) and stand in the middle of the view of the security camera there, "and flip yourself upside down!" and not move; Marvin runs a script to do motion detection and notify him if Ontoh moves at all. This helps Marvin get slightly less immediately-terrified of them, making him ready to start interrogating them]

["Are you done worrying now? There's important information you need to have, and we're both better off if I tell you as soon as possible. Since you can see me, you must've [freed yourselves] from the <em>huvith</em>, what you call the 'phrenochondria'. You need to know your enemy. Have you seen them? Have you looked out the window since ..."?]

[What the hell are you? What are you trying to do to us?]

[You <em>ethra</em> don't even have words for what I am. From your perspective, the perspective of your world, I am only… a stowaway, a saboteur. I came undetected when this timeline was created, and my only goal is to work against our mutual enemy, the one who created this timeline and bred the <em>huvith</em>, what you call the 'phrenochondria'. 


[Why are you a box with crab legs??]

[I am a branch of Ontoh, the first true immortal human, one of (greatest of?) the five ruling lineages in the main timeline. Physically, I am an immortal human head piloting one of Nochli's transport-boxes.]


[The one you should be worrying about is our mutual enemy, the one who created your timeline and put us all in this situation. The one who bred the symbionts you call the 'phrenochondria'. <em>Nochli.</em>"]

[The "ch" was pronounced like in the Scottish <em>loch</em> or the German <em>nacht</em>, making it less like "notch-lee" and more like "NA-hlee". "ˈnɑ.xliː", if you know IPA.]


["What about [the lies]?" "Sheer nonsense." "But that's what YOU said!" "I must have been making things up on the spot for temporary advantage." "How can we trust you about anything you say now?" "There is no point in me trying to lie to you in this timeline, where you obviously have the ability to interrogate me using time travel. If I wanted to hinder you, my only rational choice would be total silence. But I expect that you will also want to work against our mutual enemy, so I make myself an open book to you"]


[Have you looked out any of the south windows since you freed yourselves?]

[giant nochli blimp, "in this city people tend to keep their heads down and not look up, is this why???"]


["… And you really need to start duplicating yourselves"]








[We're not calling it the main timeline. What's it called in your language? "Salnthu, and your world could be named after the changes Nochli made, particularly the 'phrenochondria'. Nochli called them 'huvith', named after their word for a fence to keep livestock from wandering out of the field. And when they referred to the timeline they were creating, they called it 'huvinthu', which basically means 'huvith world'." 'the fenced-in world'.]

[M: so we're basically sheep, then?]

#[K: I'm not calling my world that]



[Millions of subjective years of human breeding; they did it because there was nothing stopping them, just like we do with animals [in our world, humans can fight back but animals can't; in their world, non-time travelling humans couldn't fight back either]]

[was this the inevitable future of humanity, if the ability to duplicate yourself became publicly known?]



[Duplicating people: can you do it just by using the time machine in reverse and then causing a paradox?]
