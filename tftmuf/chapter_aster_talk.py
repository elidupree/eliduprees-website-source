[not sure if in this chapter or later - we tried to find other naturally resistant people / like paranoid people? / you'd think so, but paranoia only makes them more vulnerable, because they can more easily make up alternative explanations for what they see]


[The phrenochondria show evidence of incredibly advanced genetic engineering, but who could possibly have the technology to do that?]

"Time travellers, right?" I said.

Both of them looked at me [like that was a ridiculous thing to say]

"What? Isn't that the obvious guess? You've just discovered time travel, and suddenly someone shows up with [impossibly advanced technology]. They're obviously time travellers! The [brain censorship] is even specifically <em>about time travel!</em>"

Aster leaned way back in their chair [making it creak], a thoughtful expression on their face. "[None of our time machines go back more than a day]"

But my brain was already rushing ahead ?????. "But you don't know <em>why</em> they only go back by a day! Maybe we're going to discover how to remove that limitation – heck, maybe the time travellers are <em>us</em> from the future! Think about it – maybe we [did lots more time travel but then discovered that time travel was actually really bad, and so we went back in time and used the phrenochondria to prevent anyone from discovering time travel in the first place]"

[Aster argued back, but they were clearly enjoying my theory and meant to encourage me to find workarounds to their point:] "[fundamentally the way these time machines work is that they only go back to when they were built, but the coyotes have been invisible since decades before we built any time machines] These mysterious 'time travellers' were active at least decades earlier [and possibly much longer than that – for all we know, the phrenochondria have existed for as long as <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Not longer, the great apes don't have them – we tested. But maybe that long] "

"[Maybe someone else invented time machines first]"

"They're not us," said Kayla [decisively – dour tone]. "Whoever did this, they weren't good people."

Aster's eyebrows shot up. "I'm eager to hear why you say that!"

"You mean, besides the fact that they nonconsensually mind controlled every human being on the planet?"

"Yes, besides that," said Aster, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.

????? Maybe cut the two lines above? they are cool but let's make sure they don't detract from the transition into:

"They had the technology to mind control every human being on the planet, and they only used it to stop us from time travelling. They didn't stop us from abusing each other. They didn't stop us from destroying the planet we live on. They didn't use their genetic engineering to ????? or cure diseases. With that kind of technology, they should have been able to solve all the problems in the world. But it's like they just didn't care."

"But if they're evil, why didn't they, you know… take over the world? Even if they're not time travellers, if they're, like, aliens or something. Shouldn't we all be walking around hypnotized, doing the bidding of our alien overlords? They must have had some other reason

[Maybe: an idea came sneaking into my head] "But what if they <em>did</em> [solve all the problems in the world]?" I said. "We think the phrenochondria cause personality changes, right? If they go back as far as <em>Homo sapiens</em>, we wouldn't have any way of knowing what humans would be like without them. What if people used to be even worse than they are now? And then the time travellers went back and tried to fix them, but they came from a timeline that was so horrible that even after you fixed all of their biggest problems, our problems are the ones that were left?"
?????

?????

[But where the time travellers now?

"I guess I was thinking they deleted themselves? Like to, uh, preserve human history as if their timeline never happened?"

[But why? It doesn't matter whether they're good or evil, wouldn't they stick around to see their project work? So where are they now? Shouldn't they have conquered the world or something?

"I mean… they can mind control people to not see what's right in front of them. So they could be anywhere. They could be right here in the room with us."
