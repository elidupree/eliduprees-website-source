[Because Kayla died



[Fuller putting his arm around Kayla's shoulder and making a self-congratulatory little monologue about how her life is achieving such great value for human knowledge as a test subject, which is oh so much more valuable than what ever pathetic little life she thinks she's running away to by trying to escape. Fuller's voice and body language are as if this was a completely normal conversation,; Marvin finds himself momentarily unsure of how evil it is, then is revolted ("I was struck with an understanding of why the other Marvin had been willing to help kill him")]



[when they have a bit of downtime, somehow get Kayla to talk about how humanity are probably going to wipe themselves out]

MARVIN: isn't there anything you want out of life, for yourself, when this is over?

KAYLA: of course there are things I want for myself! I want to have my own life, I want to be able to eat good food without constantly feeling guilty about who was exploited to make it for me, I want people to take me seriously, I want a boyfriend who loves me and respects me. <em>But I can't have any of that because the world is still fucked up!</em> ?????

A: "guilt, feeling like there's no future, those are PTSD symptoms"

K: then it's the people with PTSD who are correct, then! If the PTSD-havers and the PTSD-have-nots have different opinions about something, you can't just assume that one of them is correct because they don't have PTSD, you have to look at the facts â€“

A: [bit of a sigh] I grew up doing the Cold War, people thought the world was going to end any day now, and it didn't happen any of those times [i.e. "I've heard this same claim over and over"]

K: and so you assume it won't happen this time? ????? Can we agree that humanity will probably wipe themselves out _sometime_ in the next 10,000 years?

Marvin: "uhhh" I didn't want to think that humanity would wipe themselves out

A: no, please go on

K: so, let's say it happens in the year 5001. Well, in the year 5000, what do you think people will be saying? The ones without PTSD are going to be saying 'we haven't destroyed ourselves in the last 5000 years, why would it happen now?' And they'll be flat-out wrong. How do you know that's not what's happening right now?
