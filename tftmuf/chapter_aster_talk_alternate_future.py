[Because Kayla died



[Fuller putting his arm around Kayla's shoulder and making a self-congratulatory little monologue about how her life is achieving such great value for human knowledge as a test subject, which is oh so much more valuable than what ever pathetic little life she thinks she's running away to by trying to escape. Fuller's voice and body language are as if this was a completely normal conversation,; Marvin finds himself momentarily unsure of how evil it is, then is revolted ("I was struck with an understanding of why the other Marvin had been willing to help kill him")]
