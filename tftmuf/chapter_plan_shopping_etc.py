?????

[But Kayla was not at all satisfied by that plan. "You just want to break the time machines, arrest the bad guys and <em>leave</em>?"]

["What else is there to do?"] [maybe cut this]

["We need to take the time machines and use them! I don't care about going back to the world out there, it sucks anyway! But with time travel, we can <em>do</em> something about it!"]

[Ah yes, she was a young person with grand ideas, jumping way ahead of what she could actually achieve – or so I thought at first. Maybe even: it's a good thing she didn't take my advice, because then we'd have all been screwed "It's okay to just leave the world better than you found it"]

"Don't you know about climate change? About the rise of global fascism? The constant threat of nuclear war, ?????? Hell, even the pandemic? The world is already worse than when we found it. Doesn't matter if you do nothing but good deeds all day. Doesn't matter if I get out of here and live a [cute but in a mocking way] suburban little life. In twenty years we'll probably all be dead. You, me, <em>everyone</em>. And if we have a chance to <em>do</em> something about it –"

[I realized how dramatically dramatically] my Kayla had already diverged from the one in the video. Video-Kayla [had spent her first N days of time travel experience assuming that you weren't allowed to change your own past, which made it not-so-useful (you could play the stock market, maybe), and had kept thinking in that framing after she learned Aster's notes. But for my Kayla, that revelation had been upfront, and she was already thinking from a framing where you could change your own past.]

[Except that if you wanted to change it, you would end up like them. The one who made the decision would be erased from existence. And only the next version of you would keep going.]

[I could tell I wasn't going to be able to stop her. "Can we just focus on the first problem?"]

"Fine."


[Going to the store: if people see them and that causes divergence in what they text the scientists, then the later parts of the recorded timeline won't be accurate anymore. I guess we should try not to be memorable? We could use the Pattern! Maybe we don't feel good about using it on random innocent people. Maybe bring up the Ring of Gyges (Kayla would describe it, here we learn that Kayla has been a lot of philosophy to cope with existence. Kayla strongly believes that she wouldn't be corrupted by the ring)]



[Kayla sees a coyote on the way to the store and has to point out to Marvin, they start to think about how there could be things that they still can't see:]

["Hey! Watch out!"]

[Kayla was pointing. At first I didn't see anything where she was pointing at, it was just part of the road. But I kept looking, trying to grasp what it was. There was a coyote there/the face of a coyote, not like it appeared out of nowhere, more like it had been there all along and somehow my eyes had just skipped over it. With purple and white stripes, like the Pattern. Holy crap! I yelled and shooed it away (waving an object?) and it ran off]

["Were those there all along?"]

[Yeah, I've been able to see them ever since they put me on [cyanosol]. They're all over the city, they are not scared of humans at all because humans can't see them]

[I shuddered. There was one time when I had lost a sandwich while I was [standing around], I had thought I must have put it down somewhere by mistake, but probably a coyote had eaten it out of my hand and my brain just erased it from my memory. "How much other stuff is there that we can't see?"]

["The coyotes are the only thing I've seen. But you know… They're the only one I've <em>seen</em>." The implication was clear – there could be more things, and we wouldn't have any idea how many things we weren't aware of. "[Maybe: Reggie was never fully satisfied with my progress, so there must be more to see even for me]"]



[Buying lots of stuff: "I'm not super rich, but software engineers are well paid. I don't have to worry about spending a few thousand dollars if it's a real emergency."]




[We didn't know what was the deal with Reggie and Aster, but I'll let them explain it in their own words when we get to that part of the story.]



[Marvin thinks they should talk to Reggie, Kayla is resistant ("he stood around taking notes while they experimented on me!"; At the very least can we just read his notes first) They read the notes in more detail. Kayla reads more of Aster's notes while Marvin reads the time machine code?]

[Asters notes are extremely disorganized, lots of half formed sentences, using scientific terms that don't exist anywhere on the Internet. The scribblings of a genius, incomprehensible to us normal people. A note says "TODO: make a diagram of this". Notes about the other scientists, "(safe to come out to?)", Plans to stop Fuller,]

["I mean they can't be the same person if Aster is writing that they wish they could talk to Reggie. Maybe Reggie was bad, but this Aster is against Fuller"? "No, whoever wrote these notes is definitely the one I've met, so the person we've met is Aster, and Reggie is someone else"]

[Chapter break: The Bad Code]

["oh God," I said, horrified]

[Somewhere, probably not actually here: Kayla hypervigilant, demanding to know what the danger is, while Marvin struggles to figure out how to explain; Kayla angry: "you can't just say 'oh God' and not explain!" Marvin: "why would it have been something that was an immediate danger?" But I was almost as jumpy as she was,]

"So, see this line that says '"<code>if dur > 50:</code>'? That's telling the computer [of the code under it is] what to do if you want to go back in time by more than 50 minutes. [It looks like it's turning on something called a 'high-energy stabilizer'] And this other line, that says '<code>if dur < 50:</code>', that's telling the computer what to do if you say to go back in time by <em>less</em> than 50 minutes. ['Low-energy stabilizer']"

As always, Kayla saw the problem immediately. "What happens if you say <em>exactly</em> 50 minutes?"

[I don't know, maybe nothing happens. Or maybe we get splattered all over the walls of the machine! I said, my voice getting a little hysterical]

[Every part of the code had that kind of problems]

"This must be what it feels like to read the code of the Therac-25." [Shaking my head?]

["The what?"; explanation of the Therac-25, "my professor said, this is why us software engineers need to take our responsibilities seriously"]


["There's no way I can make sense of these notes. But you know who can? Aster..." Kayla doesn't like that. "Okay I know you have good reasons to not like that, but ?????. Also remember the other Kayla said maybe he is not evil?"]

["No she said maybe it's more complicated than that" but Kayla was definitely considering it. "But we can't just go talk to him, the only thing keeping us safe is the fact that they don't know we've already time traveled. If we talk to him, what if he calls Fuller and then Fuller uses his keycard and goes back in time to stop us?"]

["Well." Time to think about precautions! Eventually: "we could stay in the time machine room and call him, so if anything else happens we can go back in time again" "but then he could do anything he wants off camera – wait, is there a camera in his office?" There isn't, but we could PUT one in his office "wait, what if we come him before work? [They check the schedule] darn it, he talks to Fuller 2 minutes before Fuller talks to Marvin, so we basically can't contact him before he gets to his office" "we could have one of us wait in the time machine room, so if Fuller shows up -- "we can't wait IN the time machine room, we need to leave it open for us to come out of later, but we can wait NEAR it"]
