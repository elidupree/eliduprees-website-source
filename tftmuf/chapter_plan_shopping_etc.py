[Chapter title: The Ring of Gyges?]


"What's 'threat modeling'?"

"It's a computer security thing. [Explanation, with examples: maybe a random hacker is trying to steal your money; maybe the NSA is trying to spy on everyone; maybe an abusive partner wants to snoop on you. In this context… One adversary is the evil scientists, so we need to think about what their abilities are. They have uncertain amounts of mind control over the uninitiated, they have the time machine but only if they can get into the room with it – I can keep the doors locked, but there's a "master keycard" that can get to any of the doors; Fuller will probably have that. The other threat is the possibility of paradoxes [go over any general mitigations that weren't discussed in previous chapter] Meanwhile, our resources are: I have all the scripts the other Marvin wrote, and I can write more,]

[... which inevitably leads into the discussion of what their actual plan needs to be:]

[Maybe the other Marvin had seen things in a different way than I did, to be willing to kill the scientists; he had been plenty angry at the scientists and they were certainly evil enough, and he had made the decision himself. But for me, my first exposure to it was when I saw our future selves, with Marvin looking so devastated, and Kayla looking so [uhh... brutally pragmatic?]. Having it put right in my face, that we had already killed them, maybe it made part of me think about how we would have to live with that, instead of / When you're in the middle of a fight, you don't think ahead as much, but when you see the aftermath to begin with,]

[Can we at least try going to the police?]

["police were tried already, the first time someone died from one of the experiments. A couple of them came and asked a lot of questions, they were talking to me and all the other test subjects and I told them everything that happened, they acted like they were taking me seriously. Then Dr. Fuller walked in, smiling and acting all respectful, and said he would explain everything. The cops went in his office, I don't know what he said, but when they came out, they didn't even look at me, they just walked away. And we never heard from the police again"]

"He mind-controlled them?"

["I don't even know if he did! That was years ago, –"

[If not explained yet: they've been holding you here for years?! No, they've been <em>experimenting</em> on me for years. At first, they were still just working from the offices at the University, they only had me come in once a week for testing. They didn't lock me up here until 81 days ago]

"– Years ago, before they figured out the [cyanosol] treatment. Damn it, maybe he <em>did</em> mind-control them, because if he did, I wouldn't be able to remember it. But I thought it was just, you know…"

"Just what?"

"He's a rich white man! You think the cops are going to listen to <em>us</em>?"

"I mean… I'm a white man," I said, [without any conviction]. But I knew what she meant. In the grand scheme of things, I was nobody. Dr. Fuller owned this entire building. [He was a polished professional, it was like he could roll out of bed already dressed in "business casual"]

"What are we doing to do, tell them about the mind control? The time travel? They'll never believe us!"

"What if we just… don't tell them about that? They're still guilty of kidnapping, that's a regular crime –"[maybe: my parents gave consent for me to be here/for the "treatment". What about all the other kids though? Also they were abusing you, there's definitely a crime in here somewhere]

"So the cops will march in here, and what? Our rooms have the Pattern all over them, they won't even be able to see them. They'll just 'not find anything' and walk away like every other –"

"I could show them the photos," I said quickly, before Kayla could get angrier. "I could crop out the parts that actually have the Pattern in them. I know for a fact that what's left would still be incriminating. I think I can even get video of the experiments, so we could actually <em>show</em> the police what the Pattern does to people, so they can know to be careful." I quickly put together the pieces of a plan. "They don't even have to go in the building, they could wait for everyone to go home and arrest them at home. Then you and me can go through the building, open the locks and let out all the kids. All we have to do today is break the time machines so they can't go back in time and stop us"

[Maybe: even then, Fuller could talk his way out of it (maybe the "white man" dialogue wants to be here instead of the above?). But maybe:]

?????

[Section break] It wasn't a perfect plan; if we had thought about it more, we would have seen all the many ways it could go wrong. [Maybe: Even if Fuller went to prison, what would keep him there? He could just ask for a purple marker, draw the Pattern on a piece of paper and walk out. [Or maybe that goes further up? In the current plan scenario, the police could be told not to let him have anything purple] [actually they can't say this until after they see the coyotes]]

?????

[But Kayla was not at all satisfied by that plan./But that just revealed the real reasons Kayla didn't want to go with that plan./That plan was one end of the spectrum; it existed in contrast to Kayla's true motivations./But despite not being perfect, that plan was good enough to dismiss Kayla's practical objections, which meant that now she revealed her fundamental objections/[grand generalizations, like:] when you have a plan, sometimes there are practical reasons not to do it, and sometimes there are fundamental reasons not to do it, and if there are both, sometimes you only hear about the former, but after they are resolved, the fundamental reasons inevitably come to light,] "You just want to break the time machines, arrest the bad guys and <em>leave</em>?"]

["What else is there to do?"] [maybe cut this]

["We need to take the time machines and use them! I don't care about going back to the world out there, it sucks anyway! But with time travel, we can <em>do</em> something about it!"]

[Ah yes, she was a young person with grand ideas, jumping way ahead of what she could actually achieve – or so I thought at first. Maybe even: it's a good thing she didn't take my advice, because then we'd have all been screwed "It's okay to just leave the world better than you found it"]

"Don't you know about climate change? About the rise of global fascism? The constant threat of nuclear war, ?????? Hell, even the pandemic? The world is already worse than when we found it. Doesn't matter if you do nothing but good deeds all day. Doesn't matter if I get out of here and live a [cute but in a mocking way] suburban little life. In twenty years we'll probably all be dead. You, me, <em>everyone</em>. And if we have a chance to <em>do</em> something about it –"

[I realized how dramatically dramatically] my Kayla had already diverged from the one in the video. Video-Kayla [had spent her first N days of time travel experience assuming that you weren't allowed to change your own past, which made it not-so-useful (you could play the stock market, maybe), and had kept thinking in that framing after she learned Aster's notes. But for my Kayla, that revelation had been upfront, and she was already thinking from a framing where you could change your own past.]

[Except that if you wanted to change it, you would end up like them. The one who made the decision would be erased from existence. And only the next version of you would keep going.]

[I could tell I wasn't going to be able to stop her. "Can we just focus on the first problem?"]

"Fine."


[Going to the store: if people see them and that causes divergence in what they text the scientists, then the later parts of the recorded timeline won't be accurate anymore. I guess we should try not to be memorable? If we take the car, we could affect traffic… Should we walk? They try to walk, but Kayla struggles to walk even as far as the car, so they take the car]



[Kayla sees a coyote on the way to the store [waiting next to the car when Marvin is about to get out] and has to point out to Marvin, they start to think about how there could be things that they still can't see:]

["Hey! Watch out!"]

[Kayla was pointing. At first I didn't see anything where she was pointing at, it was just part of the road. But I kept looking, trying to grasp what it was. There was a coyote there/the face of a coyote, not like it appeared out of nowhere, more like it had been there all along and somehow my eyes had just skipped over it. With purple and white stripes, like the Pattern. Jesus Christ! I yelled and shooed it away (waving an object?) and it ran off]

["Were those there all along?"]

[Yeah, I've been able to see them ever since they put me on [cyanosol]. They're all over the city, they are not scared of humans at all because humans can't see them]

[I shuddered. There was one time when I had lost a sandwich while I was [standing around], I had thought I must have put it down somewhere by mistake, but probably a coyote had eaten it out of my hand and my brain just erased it from my memory. "How much other stuff is there that we can't see?"]

["The coyotes are the only thing I've seen. But you know… They're the only one I've <em>seen</em>." The implication was clear – there could be more things, and we wouldn't have any idea how many things we weren't aware of. "[Maybe: Reggie was never fully satisfied with my progress, so there must be more to see even for me]"]




"Wait, what if we put the Pattern on ourselves, like printed it on a shirt? Would people not see us, the same way they can't see the coyotes?"

[("this is some real Ring of Gyges shit" ("Yeesh, this is just like the Ring of G", "Real life Ring of G" she muttered)]

"Ring of what?"

"It's a story from Plato's <cite>The Republic</cite>. A man named Gyges finds a magic ring –"

[I was surprised/not expecting Kayla to be referencing Plato. "That's, uh, impressive," I mumbled.]

[Kayla immediately saw the implication that I wasn't expecting that much from her, and turned serious anger on me] "You're just like everyone else. Are you going to listen to what I say, or are you just going to stand around gaping?"

[I felt defensive, but I remembered something I'd read when I looked up the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, a quote from the guidebook they'd made:] "Refrain from arguments; the starving are ready to argue on little provocation, but they usually regret it immediately." [I swallowed my defensiveness, long enough to realize that she had made a fair point. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made assumptions. Please, [tell me what you were going to tell me]."

[Kayla began the story: (and/or bigbreak?)]

As I would later learn, [Kayla had spent lots of time reading philosophy when she was around 12, to cope with her anger and distress about everything around her. When you're having thoughts that bring you distress, about something you can't do anything about, you have two choices: you can [distract yourself and avoid thinking about the thing,] or you can [keep thinking about the thing. Mentally engaged with it. Face it.] And Kayla had always chosen the latter. She had chosen to keep trying to find ways to make sense of it/ways to interpret it that were acceptable to her.]

["A man named Gyges finds a magic ring that can make him invisible," she began. "..."]


[(Kayla strongly believes that she wouldn't be corrupted by the ring) "if you're a good person then you can recognize what's good and evil, and you can just choose not to do evil"]



"… But Plato's conclusion is unsatisfying. He says that people who behave justly will ultimately be recognized and rewarded, first by other humans, and then by the gods in the afterlife. But obviously none of that is happening."

????? "Do you believe in God?"

"Of course not," she said. "And if there <em>was</em> a God, they'd be evil. If there was anyone who has power, and they weren't evil, they would do something about all this." She [made a gesture all around]. She didn't just mean [the evil scientists], she meant our whole capitalist dystopia. "Look at who is in charge in this country, they are all Gyges-es"

[Maybe: K: what about you? / M: I'm not sure what I believe]



"[Maybe a child who grew up with the ring for their whole life, since before they developed their moral beliefs, but, <em>I</em> wouldn't use the ring of gyges to do evil stuff. Would you? If you could go into anyone's house whenever you want, and take whatever you want,]"

[I was uncomfortable because I knew that the temptation did exist for me] "I mean, uh… if you, like, steal someone's PlayStation, there's someone who's actually using that. They're going to be upset, they're going to have to replace it… maybe I'd steal from, you know," I nodded at the store in front of us.

"That doesn't count. Stealing from megacorps is a social good."

[But another thought was sneaking into the back of my mind. Sure, maybe I didn't like to upset people. But what about looking through everyone's private photos? What about bank scams where you steal half a cent from every account? If I could have whatever I wanted, and no one would even know that there was something to be upset about… I wasn't so sure I wouldn't do that. But I didn't mention that to Kayla. [She was still on a hair trigger/she was a true believer/she clearly wanted me to say that I wouldn't do that, and I didn't want to disappoint her]]



[Shopping: avoiding people's gaze, talking quietly with Kayla about what we need. Marvin pushing a shopping cart (how are we going to carry this stuff after we leave? We should get backpacks. You expect me to be able to put on a backpack?? Okay, uhh… We got a backpack for me and a fanny pack for Kayla) Getting food was tricky because Kayla was very carefully restraining herself but I couldn't stop noticing the hungry way she was staring at everything.]

[Duct tape, a screwdriver ("you always need one of these in escape room games")]

[They buy separate burner phones for every time loop. Marvin insists on buying 16 of them ("you always end up wanting more than you expect. Our last selves did 5 loops, we should get more just in case.") and 2TB flash drives for bringing video data back in time. With everything we're buying, this is thousands of dollars! How can he afford it? "I'm not super rich, but software engineers are well paid. I don't have to worry about spending a few thousand dollars if it's a real emergency."]




[We didn't know what was the deal with Reggie and Aster, but I'll let them explain it in their own words when we get to that part of the story.]



[Marvin thinks they should talk to Reggie, Kayla is resistant ("he stood around taking notes while they experimented on me!"; At the very least can we just read his notes first) They read the notes in more detail. Kayla reads more of Aster's notes while Marvin reads the time machine code?]

[Asters notes are extremely disorganized, lots of half formed sentences, using scientific terms that don't exist anywhere on the Internet. The scribblings of a genius, incomprehensible to us normal people. A note says "TODO: make a diagram of this". Notes about the other scientists, "(safe to come out to?)", Plans to stop Fuller,]

["I mean they can't be the same person if Aster is writing that they wish they could talk to Reggie. Maybe Reggie was bad, but this Aster is against Fuller"? "No, whoever wrote these notes is definitely the one I've met, so the person we've met is Aster, and Reggie is someone else"]

[Chapter break: The Bad Code]

["oh God," I said, horrified]

[Somewhere, probably not actually here: Kayla hypervigilant, demanding to know what the danger is, while Marvin struggles to figure out how to explain; Kayla angry: "you can't just say 'oh God' and not explain!" Marvin: "why would it have been something that was an immediate danger?" But I was almost as jumpy as she was,]

"So, see this line that says '"<code>if dur > 50:</code>'? That's telling the computer [of the code under it is] what to do if you want to go back in time by more than 50 minutes. [It looks like it's turning on something called a 'high-energy stabilizer'] And this other line, that says '<code>if dur < 50:</code>', that's telling the computer what to do if you say to go back in time by <em>less</em> than 50 minutes. ['Low-energy stabilizer']"

As always, Kayla saw the problem immediately. "What happens if you say <em>exactly</em> 50 minutes?"

[I don't know, maybe nothing happens. Or maybe we get splattered all over the walls of the machine! I said, my voice getting a little hysterical]

[Every part of the code had that kind of problems]

"This must be what it feels like to read the code of the Therac-25." [Shaking my head?]

["The what?"; explanation of the Therac-25 (but "I'll spare you the gruesome details" "hiding the details is wrong, it's like pretending they didn't happen!" I shuddered. "you can look them up yourself if you want to"), "my professor said, this is why us software engineers need to take our responsibilities seriously"]


["There's no way I can make sense of these notes. But you know who can? Aster..." Kayla doesn't like that. "Okay I know you have good reasons to not like that, but ?????. Also remember the other Kayla said maybe he is not evil?"]

["No she said maybe it's more complicated than that" but Kayla was definitely considering it. "But we can't just go talk to him, the only thing keeping us safe is the fact that they don't know we've already time traveled. If we talk to him, what if he calls Fuller and then Fuller uses his keycard and goes back in time to stop us?"]

["Well." Time to think about precautions! Eventually: "we could stay in the time machine room and call him, so if anything else happens we can go back in time again" "but then he could do anything he wants off camera – wait, is there a camera in his office?" There isn't, but we could PUT one in his office "wait, what if we call him before work? [They check the schedule] darn it, he talks to Fuller 2 minutes before Fuller talks to Marvin, so we basically can't contact him before he gets to his office" "we could have one of us wait in the time machine room, so if Fuller shows up -- "we can't wait IN the time machine room, we need to leave it open for us to come out of later, but we can wait NEAR it"]

[Kayla wants to do backup plans where they might cease to exist, seems unconcerned about it, while Marvin is very worried. ("And so if anything that happens, we can go back in time and get prepared for it" "no, we should go back in time and make it so we don't talk to Aster in the first place" "but that means we'd cease to exist!" "We can do the same thing they did, we can take full video recordings of what were doing, so the new versions of us will have all the information") Finally Marvin gets the idea (puts this together with how video Kayla felt?) And asks: "do you <em>want</em> to cease to exist?"]

"I'm not going to kill myself," she said decisively. "[If I kill myself then I'm letting the bad guys win]"

[She left the significant thing unspoken: the fact that she had spent enough time to thinking about it to have a clear answer. [" But when someone has a clear, decisive answer, that's because they've [spent a lot of time thinking about it/considering it]"]]

["I'm sorry [that you've been through that]" "stop that./[Sarcastically] let's all feel bad for Kayla. We need to plan this out. Look, will you at least admit that it's better to do the stable time loop thing than to just die the regular way?"]

[I guess so]

["Then we should at least keep the video recordings as a backup plan!"]

[I agreed, but I was uncomfortable with it]
