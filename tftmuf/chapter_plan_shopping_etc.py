[But Kayla was not at all satisfied by that plan. "You just want to break the time machines, arrest the bad guys and <em>leave</em>?"]

["What else is there to do?"] [maybe cut this]

["We need to take the time machines and use them! I don't care about going back to the world out there, it sucks anyway! But with time travel, we can <em>do</em> something about it!"]

[Ah yes, she was a young person with grand ideas, jumping way ahead of what she could actually achieve – or so I thought at first. Maybe even: it's a good thing she didn't take my advice, because then we'd have all been screwed "It's okay to just leave the world better than you found it"]

"Don't you know about climate change? About the rise of global fascism? The constant threat of nuclear war, ?????? Hell, even the pandemic? The world is already worse than when we found it. Doesn't matter if you do nothing but good deeds all day. Doesn't matter if I get out of here and live a [cute but in a mocking way] suburban little life. In twenty years we'll probably all be dead. You, me, <em>everyone</em>. And if we have a chance to <em>do</em> something about it –"

[I realized how dramatically dramatically] my Kayla had already diverged from the one in the video. Video-Kayla [had spent her first N days of time travel experience assuming that you weren't allowed to change your own past, which made it not-so-useful (you could play the stock market, maybe), and had kept thinking in that framing after she learned Aster's notes. But for my Kayla, that revelation had been upfront, and she was already thinking from a framing where you could change your own past.]

[Except that if you wanted to change it, you would end up like them. The one who made the decision would be erased from existence. And only the next version of you would keep going.]

[I could tell I wasn't going to be able to stop her. "Can we just focus on the first problem?"]

"Fine."


[Kayla sees a coyote on the way to the store and has to point out to Marvin, they start to think about how there could be things that they still can't see]




[We didn't know what was the deal with Reggie and Aster, but I'll let them explain it in their own words when we get to that part of the story.]



[Marvin thinks they should talk to Reggie, Kayla is resistant ("he stood around taking notes while they experimented on me!") They read the notes in more detail. Kayla reads more of Aster's notes while Marvin reads the time machine code?]

[Asters notes are extremely disorganized, lots of half formed sentences, using scientific terms that don't exist anywhere on the Internet. The scribblings of a genius, incomprehensible to us normal people. A note says "TODO: make a diagram of this". Notes about the other scientists, "(safe to come out to?)", Plans to stop Fuller,]

[Chapter break: The Bad Code]

["oh God," I said, horrified]

[Somewhere, probably not actually here: Kayla hypervigilant, demanding to know what the danger is, while Marvin struggles to figure out how to explain; Kayla angry: "you can't just say 'oh God' and not explain!" Marvin: "why would it have been something that was an immediate danger?" But I was almost as jumpy as she was,]

"So, see this line that says '"<code>if dur > 50:</code>'? That's telling the computer [of the code under it is] what to do if you want to go back in time by more than 50 minutes. [It looks like it's turning on something called a 'high-energy stabilizer'] And this other line, that says '<code>if dur < 50:</code>', that's telling the computer what to do if you say to go back in time by <em>less</em> than 50 minutes. ['Low-energy stabilizer']"

As always, Kayla saw the problem immediately. "What happens if you say <em>exactly</em> 50 minutes?"

[I don't know, maybe nothing happens. Or maybe we get splattered all over the walls of the machine! I said, my voice getting a little hysterical]

[Every part of the code had that kind of problems]

"This must be what it feels like to read the code of the Therac-25." [Shaking my head?]

["The what?"; explanation of the Therac-25, "my professor said, this is why us software engineers need to take our responsibilities seriously"]
