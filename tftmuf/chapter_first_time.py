title: What Happened the First Time (That We Knew About (Yet))


[Our divergence point was when/everything was the same for them until: when we got the message from them, and they didn't. Marvin-Zero and Kayla-Zero didn't have instructions about what to do, so they had to figure everything out themselves, while they were terrified of when the bad guys were going to find them out

"Why are they calling themselves Marvin <em>Zero</em>?" asked the Kayla next to me.

"It's a programmer thing. In programming, you usually start counting from zero. It makes sense for this because they're the ones who have time traveled zero <em>times</em>"

[They argued about what to do, but then They had a smart idea. If they locked themselves IN the time machine room, then it was safe for them to spend more time deciding what to do, because if anything bad started to happen, they could just go back in time]

[So they checked all the cameras to find a route to the time machine room that no one was watching. A completely understandable choice, but it was their first mistake. [Note: do I explain the reasons here, or below? Probably below. But still hook that it was a mistake]]

[They waited in the time machine room, Marvin made a script to notify them if anyone logged in to the security console – their second mistake. and put Tape over the security camera ("the lights were off before, they won't be able to tell the difference") They spent hours discussing what to do, until the script finally notified them [paragraph hook: "when you don't know what to do, and you have plenty of time to argue, you will inevitably argue until time forces your hand"] at 4:06 PM.]

[At that point, they knew that their enemies would be actively looking for them. they hurried to figure out the time machine, but critically, it took them another 48 minutes [while also watching what was going on in the meeting room to know how much they had to hurry?]]

[They went back to the earliest possible time, avoided the night worker, and kept arguing about what to do. They hatched a plan to kill the bad guys? [Considered how to elaborate on Marvin's take/"why not go to the police" here and how it relates to PoV-Marvin's take later] By using the security cameras to track where they were, then ambushing them]

[But at that point, Kayla-One and Marvin-One started to realize their mistakes. When they were sneaking through the buildings, what would would happen if Kayla-Zero and Marvin-Zero saw them? They would be changing their own past, causing a paradox. And the Zeros had looked on a load of different cameras.]

[So they spent their first loop starting to make the map. This time, they had the sense to not repeat their mistake: Marvin-One only checked the cameras in places where he already knew he wasn't planning to go. He even wrote a script to download the camera history only at exact times, without accidentally looking at other times. And While Marvin-Zero was using the security cameras to find their route to the time machine room, Marvin-One was watching the security <em>server logs</em>, checking the exact times and cameras where Marvin-Zero accessed the footage.


[The moment Marvin-Zero turned off the security cameras, Marvin-Two turned them on again?]


[Marvin didn't think he could go through with pulling the trigger himself, but he was willing to teach Kayla. I had grown up around guns – my father, before his passing, took me and my brothers to a shooting range every week, and taught us to respect the power and danger of the weapon. Unlike my brothers, I had never gotten a kick out of waving guns around]

"I'm so glad I kept doing the physical therapy exercises even when I was in the [holding room], otherwise I would never have been able to lift the gun and pull the trigger. I never realized how much force it takes to pull a trigger"


[And then they found Aster's Notes.]


?????


"We went back in time, just like you're about to do," she said. "We went back in time over and over. And we were careful. We made sure not to let our own past selves see us, or do anything that would change what happened to them. We didn't let anyone use the time machines except for us. And we – <em>I</em> – killed the scientists who created them."

[????? An expression of unmistakable pride ????? The revelation, already somewhat expected due to the gun and blood, that the Kayla in the video had killed real, living people. I felt disturbed by it/dissociated, feeling at a distance from things. But the Kayla crouching next to me was watching with rapt attention. In awe/admiration of the version of herself who had succeeded (?). The promise that killing those people – the ones who had held her captive – was within her power.]

"But somehow, we must have made a mistake. [????? When we were done killing them, we noticed that the original Kayla and Marvin hadn't gone back in time the way we had. Somehow, they must have seen one of the changes we made. And so they made different choices. They were still arguing about what to do. They were supposed to go back in time to become us, but if we let them go back in time ?????, they would become a <em>new</em> version of us. They would do different things than we did. And everything <em>we</em> did would be forgotten by history.

"And worse, they would meet the same fate we did. Because in the new timeline, with them instead of us, the first Kayla and Marvin <em>wouldn't</em> see the same changes we made. They'd be different again. It would be an endless loop of them almost winning, then having it all wiped away again.

"But there's a way to fix it. Reggie had some notes on his computer – God damn Reggie, I thought he was evil like the rest of them, but maybe it's more complicated. The last thing he did before he died – literally while I was shooting all of them – he wrote… well, you can look at it." Video-Kayla held something up to the camera – a slightly crumpled sticky note, with some gibberish hastily scrawled across it in ballpoint pen. And under the gibberish, it said, "LAPTOP PASSWORD – TIME TRAVELERS YOU NEED THIS".

"So we looked on his laptop. We found a file full of notes. And the notes, they said how you could make a stable loop. So that's what we're trying to do now. That's where you come in. We've gone back in time again, and we're going to send you this video, and the notes, and some other files. And then after you go back in time, you can send the same files again, to yourself. Marvin made a script that you can use, to send them at the exact same time we're sending them. And then things will be the same for the next version of you – the same as they are for the first version of you. We'll be gone – we might be already gone when you hear this – but <em>you</em> don't have to disappear."


[????? "So the first thing you need to keep in mind – you don't want to change your past, but right now, you ARE the past version. So that means you don't want to BE changed. Which basically means, don't look at anything you don't have to. If you look at something, and then you go back and change it, that's a problem. But if you didn't look at it, it's fine to change it. Of course, after you've gone back in time <em>once</em>, you'll be the future for one version of you, but the past for others. The rule is – you can always look at what your past selves are doing, but you don't want to look at anywhere you think your future selves might be.]
