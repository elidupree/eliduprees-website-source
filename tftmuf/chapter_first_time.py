title: What Happened the First Time (That We Knew About (Yet))

?????


"We went back in time, just like you're about to do," she said. "We went back in time over and over. And we were careful. We made sure not to let our own past selves see us, or do anything that would change what happened to them. We didn't let anyone use the time machines except for us. And we – <em>I</em> – killed the scientists who created them."

[????? An expression of unmistakable pride ????? The revelation, already somewhat expected due to the gun and blood, that the Kayla in the video had killed real, living people. I felt disturbed by it/dissociated, feeling at a distance from things. But the Kayla crouching next to me was watching with rapt attention. In awe/admiration of the version of herself who had succeeded (?). The promise that killing those people – the ones who had held her captive – was within her power.]

"But somehow, we must have made a mistake. [????? When we were done killing them, we noticed that the original Kayla and Marvin hadn't gone back in time the way we had. Somehow, they must have seen one of the changes we made. And so they made different choices. They were still arguing about what to do. They were supposed to go back in time to become us, but if we let them go back in time ?????, they would become a <em>new</em> version of us. They would do different things than we did. And everything <em>we</em> did would be forgotten by history.

"And worse, they would meet the same fate we did. Because in the new timeline, with them instead of us, the first Kayla and Marvin <em>wouldn't</em> see the same changes we made. They'd be different again. It would be an endless loop of them almost winning, then having it all wiped away again.

"But there's a way to fix it. Reggie had some notes on his computer – God damn Reggie, I thought he was evil like the rest of them, but maybe it's more complicated. The last thing he did before he died – literally while I was shooting all of them – he wrote… well, you can look at it." Video-Kayla held something up to the camera – a slightly crumpled sticky note, with some gibberish hastily scrawled across it in ballpoint pen. And under the gibberish, it said, "LAPTOP PASSWORD – TIME TRAVELERS YOU NEED THIS".

"So we looked on his laptop. We found a file full of notes. And the notes, they said how you could make a stable loop. So that's what we're trying to do now. That's where you come in. We've gone back in time again, and we're going to send you this video, and the notes, and some other files. And then after you go back in time, you can send the same files again, to yourself. Marvin made a script that you can use, to send them at the exact same time we're sending them. And then things will be the same for the next version of you – the same as they are for the first version of you. We'll be gone – we might be already gone when you hear this – but <em>you</em> don't have to disappear."


[????? "So the first thing you need to keep in mind – you don't want to change your past, but right now, you ARE the past version. So that means you don't want to BE changed. Which basically means, don't look at anything you don't have to. If you look at something, and then you go back and change it, that's a problem. But if you didn't look at it, it's fine to change it. Of course, after you've gone back in time <em>once</em>, you'll be the future for one version of you, but the past for others. The rule is – you can always look at what your past selves are doing, but you don't want to look at anywhere you think your future selves might be.]
