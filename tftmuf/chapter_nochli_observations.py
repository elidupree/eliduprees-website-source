Unfortunately for my theories, Nochli was definitely evil.


[Marvin's had been observing them on public camera feeds, and then expanded into hacking camera feeds. They sometimes descended from their balloon-fortresses on winged creatures, and interrogated random people, using displayed Patterns and whistled commands. We had video from reverted futures of them vivisecting people]

[They catch on that a bunch of the kidnapping targets are tech experts; maybe they passively detect cell phone communications from inside the airships, use social network information to predict who will be kidnapped next, and hack their phones to exfiltrate the interrogations; in this manner they learn that Nochli are collecting high-quality recordings from the history of Salnthu, and prioritizing replication/availability over privacy. Marvin's begin intercepting the radio transmissions between the airships, to download the recordings


[the history goes: there was a king who thought he was better than everyone else, who duplicated himself a bunch of times; but Nochli wasn't the king, he was a scribe. As the king duplicated himself, he had also duplicated Nochli, to organize his operations. But the difference between a king and a scribe is, a king isn't accustomed to working efficiently with other people as equals. As the king duplicated himself more and more, resentment began between different factions of the king, but the copies of Nochli always worked together with each other. Soon the Nochlis realized that the king's infighting was slowly getting them wiped out (by better-organized rivals), which would drive them to extinction if Nochli didn't do something, so Nochli worked together to kill (poison?) all the copies of the king and take over the faction themselves, collectively looking out for the interests of Nochli as a whole. And that's how a scribe and historian ended up being in charge of an entire faction]

[The original human Nochli doesn't seem especially evil. He grew up upper-class in that society, and is notable for being intrinsically interested in history and scholarship. He travels to record the expertise of artisans, and pays them well for it, and respects the boundaries of those who wants to keep their secrets. He's opportunistic in a positive sense, leaving situations that don't work for him instead of making a fight about it, and maintains highly trusting relationships on an individual level; on the other hand, he doesn't rock the boat of the oppression he benefits from (he is kind and pays well to his own servants, who are theoretically free to quit, but he also does logistics for construction work performed by slaves, and only improves their lot when he sees a easy opportunity to, which is infrequent). If he never abused anyone individually back then, how did he end up vivisecting people later? Maybe it's because he hadn't found the Ring of Gyges yet…]

[Human duplication was already known in his childhood, but it took decades to become the order of the whole world – in the meantime there were quite a few localized cases of mass duplication, but it usually resulted in disaster because of logistics issues (e.g. duplicating people faster than you can duplicate food for them, and then rebellion by the starving people breaks the human and material infrastructure that was being used to make more time machines.) Nochli's logistics skills contributed to pioneering more stable duplication (which the king later took advantage of), although Nochli wasn't quite an inventor, he mainly collected knowledge from others.]

[The camera was impressively neutral, watching even the everyday moments of his life; the cameraflies had no concern for privacy. Other ones viewed society as a whole, both in Salnthu and Huvinthu]

[Once the world was dominated by the factions of duplicates, Nochli was largely isolationist, defending his own territory vigorously but staying out of the conflicts of other factions that rose and fell. He used knowledge of historical conflicts to make sure he was not a desirable target to conquer, and make sure to know the strengths and weaknesses of each of his rivals, in case they did attempt it. As before, he didn't make major innovations himself, but copied and perfected the innovations by other factions. Like almost every faction, he maintained an ever-steeper power imbalance between the time travellers (his selves) and the non-time travellers he managed; Nochli maintained humanlike relationships with some of them, but those relationships steadily got more coercive and illusionary; security motivations caused Nochli to further and further restrict their access to the time machines, and by the end, anytime Nochli interacted with a non-time traveller as if there were equals, it was basically role-playing a relationship between equals]
