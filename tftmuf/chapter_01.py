[????? They hired me to do this weird graphics stuff, I guess it was for some psychological research but I have no idea what it was for]

[????? I looked up this place, but hardly found anything, certainly it wasn't a place that would be treating children medically or anything; it got harder and harder to think of innocent explanations for what I'd seen, but I hesitated]

?????

This is what happened on [????? that day].

The experiment was scheduled for 11:00 AM. At 9:56, two assistants unlocked the room where Kayla was being held, after which they led her to the experiment room and strapped her into the fMRI machine. ?????, Which resulted in Kayla being left unattended for a total of six minutes, starting at 10:07. Visible only to the room's security cameras, which no one was monitoring.

During the first two of those minutes, Kayla slipped out of her restraints and grabbed what she needed. By 10:09 AM, she was out the door. ?????

Of course, at the time, I didn't know any of that. All I knew was what I could see on the camera: a frightened, teenage girl, wearing nothing but a hospital gown, holding a scalpel in front of her like a weapon. In the twelve seconds she was in view, she entered the lobby on the fourth floor, looked quickly around her, and crept to the nearest stairs, then disappeared downwards. My mind jumped to an explanation: she was a captive, trying to escape the building. I was almost right. Right in the ways that mattered.

I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, but I'm proud of how I reacted in that moment. My worst fears about this place were realized, and I knew I had to do something – now – or I would never forgive myself. If I did nothing, I thought, Kayla was going to step out of the stairs onto the lobby floor, in plain view of half a dozen people – people I could see from my view of the camera, who she couldn't see from where she was standing. [????? I couldn't just let it happen.]

At 10:10 AM, I turned off every security camera in the building, stood up, and sprinted for the stairs. [????? I turned off the security cameras – not just the ones we were going to go past, because that would be conspicuous, but every security camera in the building.] ????? Cracked open the door and called out softly, "this way! I can help you." ????? Face-to-face with Kayla for the first time.

????? Seeing her face-to-face, ????? her face was gaunt, barely more than skin and bone. One arm clutched a tablet computer to her chest, several smaller objects bundled in a closed fist. At her other side, a bony, trembling hand still clutched the scalpel, as she stood poised on the steps above me, ready to fight or run the moment I proved to be a threat. But if I'd been expecting her to panic when I approached, my expectations were soon shattered. She [????? held still], quickly calculating how much to trust me. My first glimpse of the ruthless intelligence that defined her.

"Why are you helping me?" she asked. Not disbelief. A demand for information.

"I – I only just realized this place is holding children!" I hissed. "Of course I want to do something about that!" [????? She stayed still] "Listen, someone's going to come up the stairs anytime now, I saw it on the cameras! ????? I can hide you in my office ?????

[????? She relented and came down the stairs, in a way that was striking a balance between quickness, keeping hold of the tablet she was carrying, and quietness] "I'm trusting you," she hissed back at me, as she passed through the door I was holding. A harsh whisper, the sound of [????? someone who really doesn't trust you]. Her fist clenched tightly around the handle of the scalpel ????? I might meet a very bloody end if I betrayed her. But she followed me ?????

[????? I talked quickly as we hurried back to my office./We got to my office] "You need to get out of the building, right? I can look at all the security cameras – we can find [????? a way no one's watching, so we can sneak out –] and then I can call the police –" but something in her eyes told me she didn't think the police would save her. "Or I could call someone you trust – or I could drive you to somewhere you think you'll be safe –"

"It won't work," she said. ?????

"What?"

"Even if I get away, they'll still catch me. They have a…" she began. Her voice rattled on, hurriedly explaining things to me. But something bizarre was happening as she spoke. There was nothing wrong with her words – they were plain English, they fit together in order – but even as ten seconds passed, then twenty, my brain simply didn't make sense of them. ?????

"I'm sorry," I interrupted, "I don't understand what you're saying –"

[????? When she understood what I had said," a look of fear crossed her face. Not the immediate fear of something being going to jump out at you, but the slow dread of realizing you're trapped in a situation that will give you no choice but to do something horrible] "You – you're really not in on it," she said.

"In on what?"

In response, she uttered some more of those words I couldn't understand. But she knew right away that it wasn't working. "Damn it! I don't want to do this to you!" she said tightly. "But I need you to understand!"

"Do what?!"

[????? She couldn't answer me. she could only steel her resolve to do the thing. She swallowed and steeled her resolve to do whatever it was. Then ????? finally the meaning of the tablet she was carrying was revealed. She lowered it onto the desk, turning the screen to face me, and pressed a button.]

The next few minutes were a ?????horrifying blur. It was the animation I'd been working on. But it was different ?????

[????? When my mind came out of the blur, I took stock of what had happened. I had a stinging sensation in my arm, and I dug through half formed memories to find –]

"Is this some kind of mind control?! Did you <em>inject</em> me with something?!!" [????? I freaked out and pulled back]

"– a time machine, they have a time machine. Tell me when you can understand me. They have a time machine. They have a time machine. Tell me when you can understand –"
