Before I start telling you what I remember, I'd like to be clear about one thing. I don't want you to think of me as "<em>the real</em> Marvin ?????", or "<em>the original</em> Marvin ?????", or anything like that. Your brain is going to want to think of me that way, because I'm the one you know about – the one telling you the story. But time travel doesn't make distinctions like that. Even the ones that don't exist anymore, they were just as real as I am. And all of us branched out from the same original Marvin, and ?????

[????? And because it's me, you're getting the story starting when I got involved] For Kayla, it started 6 years earlier, when the scientists first started using her. For the scientists, it started 12 years earlier, when they published the paper they didn't realize was about time travel. For certain other parties, it started at a time that's harder to explain – several months in the future, or thousands of years in the past, depending how you look at it.

But for me, it started when I was hired by the ????? University Neuroscience Department.

Even then, I could tell they weren't just a normal neuroscience department. [my work location wasn't on ????? University campus] – my employers had somehow purchased the entire old Riker Hospital building, which I'd thought was abandoned when Riker moved to a new, modernized facility 4 years ago. [Should use absolute date?] And my paycheck came from a company called NeuroSci Innovations, which no one had ever heard of. [I should have known there was something cloak-and-dagger about it all.] But [I was in a hurry to get a new job after the startup I've been working for went under]. And the pay was good. <em>Suspiciously</em> good. Even a prestigious research university like ????? wouldn't normally have the budget to pay competitive, market rates for a computer graphics engineer. But that's what they were paying me. And I didn't say no to it.

An abandoned hospital wasn't a normal workplace for a computer graphics engineer, either. Even the commute was desolate – this region of ?????city [something-burg?] had never really recovered from the hurricane a few years back. People had lived in these destroyed homes once, but after the evacuation, most of them had seen the writing on the wall. Or in this case, the report from the state scientific commission, about the severe flooding that would soon be commonplace, in these low-lying ?????blocks close to the ocean. Just about the only people left were the diehards who ?????, and the few poor souls who were still in denial about climate change.

????? A ragged flyer posted by the City Council, asking residents to report any sightings of urban coyotes or coyote scat, and warning them not to leave food out in the open. ????? towering, square brick face of the former Riker hospital building, very anonymous; and then the interior:] Some attempt had been made to clean up the first-floor treatment rooms and convert them into offices, but in many places, racks of unused medical equipment had simply been pushed into back corners ????? other floors locked off, basically every door in the building had electronic locks and surveillance cameras all over the place ?????

Getting set up in the makeshift office was an adventure in itself. First of all, every single computer in the office had a physical blue-green color filter glued over the monitor. My new boss told me we were working on making animated color patterns for some kind of psychology research, and the color filters were for "ethics". [the research was to show people the pattern and see how it affected them, and so they didn't want to expose anyone except the intended test subjects. So we were doing all the prototyping using color-swapped versions of the actual pattern, ????? at least, that's what my new boss said.

"What happens if you look at it?" I asked, curious.

"I don't know, probably nothing. But they're huge sticklers ????? I thought they had to be joking, but some of the other guys looked at it, and they were fired before I got back from my lunch break. And they put the blue things on the screens the same day, so now you can't even" [but in hindsight, it hits differently./ In hindsight, it feels silly to have scoffed at that level of caution. [????? he scoffed at ethics, but even when you're cynic, sometimes you are still naive] To you or me, "ethics" means trying to do the right thing. But to them, "ethics" was just a convenient excuse – an excuse that they could bring out whenever [it would get them what they want], and put away whenever it wouldn't.

"What are the real colors?" I asked him once.

He chuckled. "Don't forget, I'm a programmer too. I know how programmers are. If I tell you the real colors, you'll want to look at it yourself"

[Physical description of the pattern in blue/green, "it was kind of hypnotic, but like, not anything special"]

[????? They got me set up on the actual work, which turned out to be this weird graphics stuff, I guess it was for some psychological research but I have no idea what it was for ????? they surveilled us to make sure we didn't look at the true-color version of the pattern, supposedly because of research ethics, but ????? told me they heard some of the other programmers looked at it and they got fired, and then the higher-ups put these color filters, guess we should just play along ????? "????? my direct boss, another programmer, didn't know what the deal was either, told me the higher-ups (Fuller?) don't know how to work with a programmer, don't get things done too quickly because that'll increase their expectations – ?????]

[????? But my one flaw has always been that I can't look away from something once I get curious. I wanted to know what was on the locked-off floors, what all this security was for ????? I looked up the brand of the security cameras – the brand name on all of them was PanoptiLock, so I looked them up online. They sold expensive, high-tech security equipment, which looked great in the marketing videos – looked great if you didn't know how to search for opinions from actual security professionals. But I was plugged in the security community; I quickly found reviews pointing out all the rookie mistakes in PanoptiLock products. And in particular, all their security cameras shipped with the same default password. So I tried the password. Looking at the security cameras – I wasn't trying to be some sort of citizen-investigator, finding what they were up to, I was just doing it because I was curious. Because I <em>could</em>. What Reginald would later call "a profoundly amoral decision"]

[????? I made it a whole little project, detecting motion and applying image classifiers. If you don't know what an image classifier is, it's one of those AI tools that they use at places like Google – you put in an image, and it gives you a bad guess about what it's a picture of.

[But what I found… Was nothing./Was notable for its failure to tell me anything. I saw workers and offices and medical equipment, chemistry labs where I overhear technical conversations beyond my understanding, but somehow, I could never catch anyone saying what the overall purpose of the place was.

[seemed like Reggie was in two places at once, I thought there was like an error or something]

[wrote out what was happening in each room, to try to get a sense of the big picture]

[????? If it wasn't for the image classifiers, I would never have noticed, I would have just glanced past and assumed there wasn't anything there. Even after it said "child on bed", I still just assumed the classifier was wrong, like usual. But because I was keeping notes on each camera, it eventually became conspicuous that those few rooms were the ones that were still blank. I sat at home staring at the images, wondering what was in them that made them get classified as children, when there obviously weren't any children in the pictures. Or, as I eventually began to wonder – why my brain couldn't explain what they were instead of children.]

[I sent one of the photos to a friend, who would normally have always gotten back to me, and he just ignored it]

[????? I started managing to catch glimpses of the children while they were being transported. It didn't look consensual. Was this secretly a mental hospital? Was this human trafficking?

[????? I looked up this place, but hardly found anything – almost all the search results for the address where from back when it was Riker Hospital, the only one more recently was a deleted post. Certainly it wasn't being advertised as a place of medical treatment for children; it got harder and harder to think of innocent explanations for what I'd seen, but I hesitated. How could I explain it? Would they retaliate against me?]

????? [I don't know what I would have done if time had just gone on, if Kayla hadn't forced the issue. Would I have tried to report them?

[hype Fuller somehow, followed by: the morning of the day when it happened, Fuller greeted me in the morning [chatting with Marvin in his condescendingly encouraging way]. I got up the courage to ask him "what do we actually do on the upper floors", as if it was just innocent curiosity. "It's very cutting-edge research you're supporting. Very technical" "try me, I can understand a lot of technical things". He explained, but indeed I couldn't understand it ("my eyes glazed over", but the internal version of that?). And then he clapped me on the shoulders, encouraging "keep up the good work". But then I had the presence of mind to look back at the security camera recording of the conversation, and saw how I reacted to his explanation – I could barely remember it at all, and he had a little smirk on his face, knowing full well that he could get away with saying whatever he wanted, because my brain would censor what he was saying]

<bigbreak>

This is what happened on [????? that day].

The ?????phorin Experiment was scheduled for 11:00 AM. At 9:56, two assistants unlocked the room where Kayla was being held, and told her she was to be taken to the experiment room. She complied. ????? Kayla, who was physically weak and stumbling, accidentally-on-purpose knocked one of the assistants into a ?????/Kayla was already physically weak and stumbling, and they knew this; this gave her an excuse to… ?????, vials of medicine shattered on the floor. Once they had strapped her into the fMRI machine, there was a hasty discussion. Dr. Fuller would be very angry, they agreed; it was imperative that this mess be gone before he learned of it. At 10:05, they agreed to split up – one to fetch replacements, the other to stay and clean. But as soon as the second assistant was alone, he realized he had no broom or dustpan to clear the broken glass. He glanced at Kayla; the must have known it would break protocol to leave her unattended. But she was fully restrained, lying motionless in the machine. Surely nothing would happen in just a few minutes. Surely Dr. Fuller's anger was a more urgent concern. This resulted in Kayla being left unattended for a total of six minutes, starting at 10:07. Only the room's security cameras could see her, and no one was monitoring them at the time – at least, not in the first timeline.

26 seconds from the moment the door closed, Kayla had fully freed herself from the restraints. Over the next 18 seconds, she rushed about the room, gathering the things she would need. By 10:09 AM, she was out the door. ????? sped down the hallway, following the exit signs to find ????? stairs.

And that's where I came in. At that moment, I just so happened to be <em>watching</em> the camera that she ran past. [Happened to glance through the other cameras right after I was done watching my conversation with Fuller?] Of course, at the time, I had no idea of what had just happened before that. All I knew was what I could see on the camera. And what I saw – the way my mind first interpreted it – was a frightened, teenage girl, wearing nothing but a hospital gown, holding a scalpel in front of her like a weapon. In the twelve seconds she was in view, she entered the lobby on the fourth floor, looked quickly around her, and crept to the nearest stairs, then disappeared downwards. My mind jumped to an explanation: she was a captive, trying to escape the building. I was almost right. Right in the ways that mattered.

I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, but I'm proud of how I reacted in that moment. My worst fears about this place were realized, and I knew that if I didn't take action – immediately – then I would never forgive myself. If I did nothing, I thought, Kayla was going to step out of the stairs onto the lobby floor, in plain view of half a dozen people – people I could see from my view of the camera, who she couldn't see from where she was standing. [????? I couldn't just let it happen.]

I knew I had to [make sure my actions wouldn't be visible on the security cameras later, and it would be suspicious to only turn off the ones that would be relevant] At 10:10 AM, I turned off every security camera in the building, stood up, and sprinted for the stairs. [????? I turned off the security cameras – not just the ones we were going to go past, because that would be conspicuous, but every security camera in the building.] ????? Cracked open the door and called out softly, "this way! I can help you." ????? Face-to-face with Kayla for the first time.

????? Seeing her face-to-face, ????? her face was gaunt, barely more than skin and bone. One arm clutched a tablet computer to her chest, several smaller objects bundled in a closed fist. At her other side, a bony, trembling hand still clutched the scalpel, as she stood poised on the steps above me, ready to fight or run the moment I proved to be a threat. But if I'd been expecting her to panic when I approached, my expectations were soon shattered. She [????? held still], quickly calculating how much to trust me. My first glimpse of the ruthless intelligence that defined her.

"Why are you helping me?" she asked. Not disbelief. A demand for information.

"I – I only just realized this place is holding people against their will!" I hissed. "Of course I want to do something about that!" [????? She stayed still] "Listen, someone's going to come up the stairs anytime now, I saw it on the cameras! ????? I can hide you in my office ?????

[????? She relented and came down the stairs, in a way that was striking a balance between quickness, keeping hold of the tablet she was carrying, and quietness] "I'm trusting you," she hissed back at me, as she passed through the door I was holding. A harsh whisper, the sound of [????? someone who really doesn't trust you]. Her fist clenched tightly around the handle of the scalpel ????? I might meet a very bloody end if I betrayed her. But she followed me ????? [physical description contrasting Marvin (slightly pudgy, thirty-five-year-old) and Kayla, somewhere in this paragraph]

[????? I talked quickly as we hurried back to my office./We got to my office] "You need to get out of the building, right? I can look at all the security cameras – we can find [????? a way no one's watching, so we can sneak out –] and then I can call the police –" but something in her eyes told me she didn't think the police would save her. "Or I could call someone you trust – or I could drive you to somewhere you think you'll be safe –"

"It won't work," she said. ?????

"What?"

Her words came quickly, low and urgent. "None of that would work! I can't run, they're always waiting for me right after I get away. They have a…"

But as she kept speaking, something bizarre began to happen. There was nothing wrong with her words – they were plain English, they fit together in order – but even as ten seconds passed, then twenty, my brain simply didn't make sense of them. ????? [If I hadn't experienced the stuff I'd experienced earlier, I would have just let her keep talking, I wouldn't have noticed that something was weird was happening that would make me need to interrupt. But my experiences gave me an inkling that I really needed to interrupt her]

"I'm sorry," I interrupted, "I don't understand what you're saying –"

I had been afraid that she ????? wouldn't know what I meant, that I would have to explain how it was that I didn't understand]. But I knew instantly that she had understood. The look that blossomed on her face wasn't confusion or frustration – it was <em>fear</em>. [She knew that she could keep trying to tell me these things, What she desperately needed me to know, but I would never understand, and then her time would run out. Or, as I later understood, that her only option was to do something horrible

[????? When she understood what I had said," a look of fear crossed her face. Not the immediate fear of something being going to jump out at you, but the slow dread of realizing you're trapped in a situation that will give you no choice but to do something horrible] "You – you're really not in on it," she said.

"In on what?" [????? this response shouldn't get its own paragraph, but the earlier ones are okay]

In response, she uttered some more of those words I couldn't understand. But she knew right away that it wasn't working. "Damn it! [I don't want to do this to you! / I didn't take this to use it on an innocent person!]" she said tightly. "But I need you to understand!"

"Do what?!"

[????? She couldn't answer me. she could only steel her resolve to do the thing. She swallowed and steeled her resolve to do whatever it was. Then ????? finally the meaning of the tablet she was carrying was revealed. She lowered it onto the desk, turning the screen to face me, and pressed a button labeled OVERSTIM.]

The next few minutes were a ?????horrifying blur.

On some level, deep in my mind, I understood what my eyes were staring at. It was the animation I'd been working on. The only difference was the color, no longer green and red, but purple and white. But somehow, the colors reached deep into my brain, gripping my deepest instincts, holding me in a dreamlike state where I couldn't form a coherent thought, [my brain refusing to acknowledge that the Pattern was even there] [an unconscious need to obey a incoherent range of commands] [probably something humiliating from Marvin's past here] [more details referring back to the initial description] ?????

[????? my head still spinning, a stinging sensation in my arm, brain frantically digging through half-formed memories to find any idea of where I was, what had happened in the last hour –]

[????? Finally a fragmented image stayed in place, Kayla crouching in front of me, speaking quickly with an expression of worry on her face, the injector in her hand – I looked back at my stinging arm –, "Is this some kind of mind control?! Did you <em>inject</em> me with something?!!" [????? I freaked out and pulled back]

But then, my mind caught up with the words she had been saying.

"– a time machine, they have a time machine. Tell me when you can understand me. They have a time machine. They have a time machine. Tell me when you can understand –"

And it all fell into place. The ????? Reggie being in 2 places at once. The ????? . "A time machine –" I gasped "– the machine in the [underground floor]"

[Kayla was instantly relieved that I could understand, she rushed to explain] "You were already being mind controlled. Everyone here is, everyone but the scientists in charge. What I did is, I broke the control. The overstim, the ?????cyanosol injections, they're what they tested on me, they're why I can resist it. Everyone else, you can talk about time travel right in front of them and they just stare past you – "

?????

????? The message arrived. A message on my work account. A message from <em>myself</em>. ????? A zip file attached

When your body is in fight-or-flight mode, the time it takes a computer to unpack an archive feels like forever. ????? [????? Hyper focused on the screen, my eyes jumped to 01_WATCH_THIS_FIRST.mp4 the moment it appeared]

Like many an unedited, amateur video, it began in a blur of motion, as its maker tapped the record button on their phone and set the phone down where it would get a good view – a view of a room much like this one, no doubt a conference room somewhere in this very building. [????? It was night though, and the people in the video were Kayla, and me. Marvin.]

But the Kayla in the video was dramatically changed from the Kayla beside me. The desperate look was gone from her eyes, a bit of fat back in her cheeks, standing tall and proud, with an honest-to-God <em>rifle</em> on a sling over one shoulder. She was dressed in a bright, fresh-off-the-shelf jacket and jeans, marred only by splatters of drying blood, which I could only assume were not her own. But despite ????? still a look of deep exhaustion on her face

"Oh God, how do we say this to them?" muttered the Kayla in the video, dead tired, a voice of resignation. She glanced to the side, at my own double, the way someone glances when they're hoping someone else will take charge, so they won't have to do the difficult work themselves.

But my double could not help her. Whatever our duplicates had been through, Kayla had endured it, but Marvin had been emotionally destroyed by it. [????? He had a hollow, haunted look, and the moment he was asked to speak, he broke down completely. He sank down in his seat, sobbing into his hands, completely nonverbal].

Video-Kayla let out a short breath and pulled her eyes away from Marvin, a quiet acknowledgment that she was on her own. [????? Reluctantly,] she looked back at the camera – at us.

"Listen," she said. "We messed up. We caused a paradox, and pretty soon, we're going to cease to exist. And if you don't want the same thing to happen to you, here's what you have to do."
