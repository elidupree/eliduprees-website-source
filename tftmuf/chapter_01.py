Before I start telling you what I remember, I'd like to be clear about one thing. I don't want you to think of me as "<em>the real</em> Marvin ?????", or "<em>the original</em> Marvin ?????", or anything like that. Your brain is going to want to think of me that way, because I'm the one you know about – the one telling you the story. But time travel doesn't make distinctions like that. All of us branched out from the same original Marvin, and

[????? And because it's me, you're getting the story starting when I got involved] For Kayla, it started 6 years earlier, when the scientists first started using her. For the scientists, it started 12 years earlier, when they published the paper they didn't realize was about time travel. For certain other parties, it started at a time that's harder to explain – several months in the future, or thousands of years in the past, depending how you look at it.

But for me, it started when I was hired by the ????? University Neuroscience Department.

Even then, I could tell they weren't just a normal neuroscience department. [my work location wasn't on ????? University campus] – my employers had somehow purchased the entire old Riker Hospital building, which I'd thought was abandoned when Riker moved to a new, modernized facility 4 years ago. [Should use absolute date?] And my paycheck came from a company called NeuroSci Innovations, which no one had ever heard of. [I should have known there was something cloak-and-dagger about it all.] But [I was in a hurry to get a new job after the startup I've been working for went under]. And the pay was good. <em>Suspiciously</em> good. Even a prestigious research university like ????? wouldn't normally have the budget to pay competitive, market rates for a computer graphics engineer. But that's what they were paying me. And I didn't say no to it.

An abandoned hospital wasn't a normal workplace for a computer graphics engineer, either. [The former Riker hospital… Give a sense of physical progression – the commute there along desolate streets, where the hurricane a few years back had damaged buildings, and not as many people moved back because climate change was going to make this land have loads of flooding anyway [and that's why Riker moved their campus?]; now coyote scat was a common sighting and the City Council had to warn you not to leave food out; towering, square brick face of the building, very anonymous; and then the interior:] Some attempt had been made to clean up the first-floor treatment rooms and convert them into offices, but in many places, racks of unused medical equipment had simply been pushed into back corners ????? other floors locked off, basically every door in the building had electronic locks and surveillance cameras all over the place ?????

Getting set up in the makeshift office was an adventure in itself. First of all, every single computer in the office had a physical blue-green color filter glued over the monitor. My new boss told me we were working on making animated color patterns for some kind of psychology research, and the color filters were for "ethics". [the research was to show people the pattern and see how it affected them, and so they didn't want to expose anyone except the intended test subjects. So we were doing all the prototyping using color-swapped versions of the actual pattern, ????? at least, that's what my new boss said.

"What happens if you look at it?" I asked, curious.

"I don't know, probably nothing. But they're huge sticklers ????? I thought they had to be joking, but some of the other guys looked at it, and they were fired before I got back from my lunch break. And they put the blue things on the screens the same day, so now you can't even" [but in hindsight, it hits differently. [????? he scoffed at ethics, but even when you're cynic, sometimes you are still naive] To you or me, "ethics" means trying to do the right thing. But to them, "ethics" was just a convenient excuse – an excuse that they could bring out whenever [it would get them what they want], and put away whenever it wouldn't.

"What are the real colors?" I asked him once.

He chuckled. "Don't forget, I'm a programmer too. I know how programmers are. If I tell you the real colors, you'll want to look at it yourself"

[Physical description of the pattern in blue/green, "it was kind of hypnotic, but like, not anything special"]

[????? They got me set up on the actual work, which turned out to be this weird graphics stuff, I guess it was for some psychological research but I have no idea what it was for ????? they surveilled us to make sure we didn't look at the true-color version of the pattern, supposedly because of research ethics, but ????? told me they heard some of the other programmers looked at it and they got fired, and then the higher-ups put these color filters, guess we should just play along ????? "????? my direct boss, another programmer, didn't know what the deal was either, told me the higher-ups (Fuller?) don't know how to work with a programmer, don't get things done too quickly because that'll increase their expectations – ?????]

[????? But my one flaw has always been that I can't look away from something once I get curious. I wanted to know what was on the locked-off floors, what all this security was for ????? I looked up the brand of the security cameras, and saw that they had a default password, and tried the default password. Looking at the security cameras – I wasn't trying to be some sort of citizen-investigator, finding what they were up to, I was just doing it because I was curious. Because I <em>could</em>. What Reginald would later call "a profoundly amoral decision"]

[????? I made it a whole little project, detecting motion and applying image classifiers. If you don't know what an image classifier is, it's one of those AI tools that they use at places like Google – you put in an image, and it gives you a bad guess about what it's a picture of.

[seemed like Reggie was in two places at once, I thought there was like an error or something]

[wrote out what was happening in each room, to try to get a sense of the big picture]

[????? If it wasn't for the image classifiers, I would never have noticed, I would have just glanced past and assumed there wasn't anything there. Even after it said "child on bed", I still just assumed the classifier was wrong, like usual. But because I was keeping notes on each camera, it eventually became conspicuous that those few rooms were the ones that were still blank. I sat at home staring at the images, wondering what was in them that made them get classified as children, when there obviously weren't any children in the pictures. Or, as I eventually began to wonder – why my brain couldn't explain what they were instead of children.]

[????? I looked up this place, but hardly found anything, certainly it wasn't a place that would be treating children medically or anything; it got harder and harder to think of innocent explanations for what I'd seen, but I hesitated]

?????

<bigbreak>

This is what happened on [????? that day].

The ?????phorin Experiment was scheduled for 11:00 AM. At 9:56, two assistants unlocked the room where Kayla was being held, and told her she was to be taken to the experiment room. She complied. ????? Kayla, who was physically weak and stumbling, accidentally-on-purpose knocked one of the assistants into a ?????/Kayla was already physically weak and stumbling, and they knew this; this gave her an excuse to… ?????, vials of medicine shattered on the floor. Once they had strapped her into the fMRI machine, there was a hasty discussion. Dr. Fuller would be very angry, they agreed; it was imperative that this mess be gone before he learned of it. At 10:05, they agreed to split up – one to fetch replacements, the other to stay and clean. But as soon as the second assistant was alone, they realized they had no broom or dustpan to clear the broken glass. They glanced at Kayla; they must have known it would break protocol to leave her unattended. But she was fully restrained, lying motionless in the machine. Surely nothing would happen in just a few minutes. Surely Dr. Fuller's anger was a more urgent concern. This resulted in Kayla being left unattended for a total of six minutes, starting at 10:07. Visible only to the room's security cameras, which no one was monitoring.

26 seconds from the moment the door closed, Kayla had fully freed herself from the restraints. Over the next 18 seconds, she rushed about the room, gathering the things she would need. By 10:09 AM, she was out the door. ????? sped down the hallway, following the exit signs to find ????? stairs.

And that's where I came in. At that moment, I just so happened to be <em>watching</em> the camera that she ran past. Of course, at the time, I had no idea of what had just happened. All I knew was what I could see on the camera. And what I saw – the way my mind first interpreted it – was a frightened, teenage girl, wearing nothing but a hospital gown, holding a scalpel in front of her like a weapon. In the twelve seconds she was in view, she entered the lobby on the fourth floor, looked quickly around her, and crept to the nearest stairs, then disappeared downwards. My mind jumped to an explanation: she was a captive, trying to escape the building. I was almost right. Right in the ways that mattered.

I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, but I'm proud of how I reacted in that moment. My worst fears about this place were realized, and I knew that if I didn't take action – immediately – then I would never forgive myself. If I did nothing, I thought, Kayla was going to step out of the stairs onto the lobby floor, in plain view of half a dozen people – people I could see from my view of the camera, who she couldn't see from where she was standing. [????? I couldn't just let it happen.]

At 10:10 AM, I turned off every security camera in the building, stood up, and sprinted for the stairs. [????? I turned off the security cameras – not just the ones we were going to go past, because that would be conspicuous, but every security camera in the building.] ????? Cracked open the door and called out softly, "this way! I can help you." ????? Face-to-face with Kayla for the first time.

????? Seeing her face-to-face, ????? her face was gaunt, barely more than skin and bone. One arm clutched a tablet computer to her chest, several smaller objects bundled in a closed fist. At her other side, a bony, trembling hand still clutched the scalpel, as she stood poised on the steps above me, ready to fight or run the moment I proved to be a threat. But if I'd been expecting her to panic when I approached, my expectations were soon shattered. She [????? held still], quickly calculating how much to trust me. My first glimpse of the ruthless intelligence that defined her.

"Why are you helping me?" she asked. Not disbelief. A demand for information.

"I – I only just realized this place is holding children!" I hissed. "Of course I want to do something about that!" [????? She stayed still] "Listen, someone's going to come up the stairs anytime now, I saw it on the cameras! ????? I can hide you in my office ?????

[????? She relented and came down the stairs, in a way that was striking a balance between quickness, keeping hold of the tablet she was carrying, and quietness] "I'm trusting you," she hissed back at me, as she passed through the door I was holding. A harsh whisper, the sound of [????? someone who really doesn't trust you]. Her fist clenched tightly around the handle of the scalpel ????? I might meet a very bloody end if I betrayed her. But she followed me ?????

[????? I talked quickly as we hurried back to my office./We got to my office] "You need to get out of the building, right? I can look at all the security cameras – we can find [????? a way no one's watching, so we can sneak out –] and then I can call the police –" but something in her eyes told me she didn't think the police would save her. "Or I could call someone you trust – or I could drive you to somewhere you think you'll be safe –"

"It won't work," she said. ?????

"What?"

Her words came quickly, low and urgent. "None of that would work! I can't run, they'll still catch me even if I get away. They have a…"

But as she kept speaking, something bizarre began to happen. There was nothing wrong with her words – they were plain English, they fit together in order – but even as ten seconds passed, then twenty, my brain simply didn't make sense of them. ?????

"I'm sorry," I interrupted, "I don't understand what you're saying –"

I had been afraid that she ????? wouldn't know what I meant, that I would have to explain how it was that I didn't understand]. But I knew instantly that she had understood. The look that blossomed on her face wasn't confusion or frustration – it was <em>fear</em>. [She knew that she could keep trying to tell me these things, What she desperately needed me to know, but I would never understand, and then her time would run out. Or, as I later understood, that her only option was to do something horrible

[????? When she understood what I had said," a look of fear crossed her face. Not the immediate fear of something being going to jump out at you, but the slow dread of realizing you're trapped in a situation that will give you no choice but to do something horrible] "You – you're really not in on it," she said.

"In on what?" [????? this response shouldn't get its own paragraph, but the earlier ones are okay]

In response, she uttered some more of those words I couldn't understand. But she knew right away that it wasn't working. "Damn it! I don't want to do this to you!" she said tightly. "But I need you to understand!"

"Do what?!"

[????? She couldn't answer me. she could only steel her resolve to do the thing. She swallowed and steeled her resolve to do whatever it was. Then ????? finally the meaning of the tablet she was carrying was revealed. She lowered it onto the desk, turning the screen to face me, and pressed a button labeled OVERSTIM.]

The next few minutes were a ?????horrifying blur.

On some level, deep in my mind, I understood what my eyes were staring at. It was the animation I'd been working on. The only difference was the color, no longer green and red, but purple and white. But somehow, the colors reached deep into my brain, gripping my deepest instincts, holding me in a dreamlike state where I couldn't form a coherent thought, [my brain refusing to acknowledge that the Pattern was even there] [probably something humiliating from Marvin's past here] [more details referring back to the initial description] ?????

[????? my head still spinning, a stinging sensation in my arm, brain frantically digging through half-formed memories to find any idea of where I was, what had happened in the last hour –]

[????? Finally a fragmented image stayed in place, Kayla crouching in front of me, speaking quickly with an expression of worry on her face, the injector in her hand – I looked back at my stinging arm –, "Is this some kind of mind control?! Did you <em>inject</em> me with something?!!" [????? I freaked out and pulled back]

But then, my mind caught up with the words she had been saying.

"– a time machine, they have a time machine. Tell me when you can understand me. They have a time machine. They have a time machine. Tell me when you can understand –"

And it all fell into place. The ????? Reggie being in 2 places at once. The ????? . "A time machine –" I gasped "– the machine in the [underground floor]"

[Kayla was instantly relieved that I could understand, she rushed to explain] "You were already being mind controlled. Everyone here is, everyone but the scientists in charge. What I did is, I broke the control. The overstim, the ?????cyanosol injections, they're what they tested on me, they're why I can resist it. Everyone else, you can talk about time travel right in front of them and they just stare past you – "

?????

????? The message arrived. A message on my work account. A message from <em>myself</em>. ????? A zip file attached

When your body is in fight-or-flight mode, the time it takes a computer to unpack an archive feels like forever. ????? [????? Hyper focused on the screen, my eyes jumped to 01_WATCH_THIS_FIRST.mp4 the moment it appeared]

Like many an unedited, amateur video, it began in a blur of motion, as its maker tapped the record button on their phone and set the phone down where it would get a good view – a view of a room much like this one, no doubt a conference room somewhere in this very building. [????? It was night though, and the people in the video were Kayla, and me. Marvin.]

But the Kayla in the video was dramatically changed from the Kayla beside me. The desperate look was gone from her eyes, a bit of fat back in her cheeks, standing tall and proud, with an honest-to-God <em>rifle</em> on a sling over one shoulder. She was dressed in a bright, fresh-off-the-shelf jacket and jeans, marred only by splatters of drying blood, which I could only assume were not her own. But despite ????? still a look of deep exhaustion on her face

"Oh God, how do we say this to them?" muttered the Kayla in the video, dead tired, a voice of resignation. She glanced to the side, at my own double, the way someone glances when they're hoping someone else will take charge, so they won't have to do the difficult work themselves.

But my double could not help her. Whatever our duplicates had been through, Kayla had endured it, but Marvin had been emotionally destroyed by it. [????? He had a hollow, haunted look, and the moment he was asked to speak, he broke down completely. He sank down in his seat, sobbing into his hands, completely nonverbal].

Video-Kayla let out a short breath and pulled her eyes away from Marvin, a quiet acknowledgment that she was on her own. [????? Reluctantly,] she looked back at the camera – at us.

"Listen," she said. "We messed up. We caused a paradox, and pretty soon, we're going to cease to exist. And if you don't want the same thing to happen to you, here's what you have to do."



?????

[????? In chapter 2, I think:]

[????? Reestablish scene, maybe mention more details here]

She continued in that same, dead-tired voice.

"You need to get to one of the time machines as soon as you can. Once you go back, you can send this video to yourselves, so it turns into a stable time loop. Don't think about how that works right now, you'll have plenty of time to think about it once you're back at 3 AM. Right now, you have to worry about getting there.

"The time machines are [????? on floor]. You can take the stairs at the end of the North Wing, they're safe because no one uses them all day. But even so, you want to spend as little time in the halls as possible. And while you're walking there, don't look at anything if you can help it! Keep your head down, don't look in any of the rooms you go past, definitely don't look at other places on the security cameras –"

"– but leave them on!" croaked a voice – my voice, Marvin's voice, speaking for the first time since the video started. It was breathy and breaking, the voice of someone who has been crying for hours, who is only forcing themselves to speak because of a sudden need. "Leave the cameras on! No one ch–" he gasped, before his throat failed him again, lapsing into voiceless breaths.

"– no one checks them until the meeting at 4 PM," video-Kayla finished for him. "He's right – leave them on, but don't look at them. That'll save you a lot of the trouble we had to deal with. But right now, you need to… uh…" she looked to Marvin again. "Damn it, Marv, you know I'll say it wrong if I have to tell them the computer stuff…"

But once you've forced out the first few words, the rest of the words come easier. Marvin lifted his head halfway out of his hands, not quite daring to look directly at the camera. "We – we're going to put this video in a zip file, with – with some other documents. You'll need to copy the whole zip file onto a USB stick so you can bring it back with you. I – I guess you should start copying it now, don't wait for the video to finish, it might take a little while. And then – we – we'll make some instructions for you to print out – so I guess you should start printing those, next, after you start the copy. [????? Video to show you how to use the time machine]" [????? he kept rambling, weak voice, not really believing in it]

????? The Kayla crouching next to me – not tired like the one from the video, but gaunt, strung tight with terror – ????? "Why aren't you doing what he said?" she hissed.

Her words [????? knocked me out of my hypnotized state]. I fumbled through Marvin's instructions, digging a USB drive out of a drawer in my desk, then finding the file to print – 02_print_this_out.png. It was definitely me who had chosen these filenames – practical names, telling me what I needed to know, using two digits out of habit even though the files only went up to ????? "09". It was eerie, seeing my own handiwork on something I had no memory of creating.

There are few things as maddening as being told that you must not look at something, when the thing is all around you. [????? The walk down the hallway shouldn't have been hard, but) maybe: should have been the easiest part of what we needed to do ????? repeatedly wanting to look into the rooms, look over my shoulder]

"It feels like we're being followed," I muttered to myself.

I shouldn't have said it in front of Kayla [????? who was still on high alert. She whipped around, eyes scanning the corridor behind us.]



[????? Kayla's harsh/sudden whisper] "I feel like we're being followed," [????? she said]

????? Face-to-face with the time machine

The time machine didn't look like something from a sci-fi movie. It was a bulky structure of rough metal. Not like something from a sci-fi movie, more like an relic from the Industrial Revolution. ????? Other than being plugged into a computer, it was old-looking ????? But maybe I SHOULD have been scared by something from the Industrial Revolution. A new invention, nowhere near perfected, but already able to radically alter the world as we knew it. And maybe not for the better.

We had no idea of the danger we were in. Even the Marvin from the video, sobbing in terror of what would happen to him, [hadn't seen the full implications.]

We had already seen what the time machine looked like, in our future selves' instructional video. Its central structure was an enormous egg, stretching from floor to ceiling, held in place by ????? [physical description, Hatch]

[But we couldn't climb into that Hatch right away. The procedure was: [/ First, we had to [enter into] the computer the exact mass of the matter to be transported.]]

Its central structure was a [steel eggs]

[????? We had already seen it in the video, so it's appearance wasn't surprising, but it was still intimidating. The first thing that demanded your attention when you walked into the room, an 8 foot tall, gleaming egg of steel, towering above us. It had clearly been built in several pieces, and then bolted together here, huge steel plates sticking out of the surface where the join lines were. On the face closest to us, a step ladder leading up to a hatch, also made of bulky metal plates, not tall enough to stand up, but you could crawl through it]

[????? It was just sitting there, deceptively inactive, looking like a bulky antique from the Industrial Revolution. Not like something that could delete us from existence. But it was. Even the Marvin from the video, sobbing in terror of what would happen to him, hadn't even begun to understand the danger we were in.]

[????? But we couldn't climb into that hatch right away. Before anyone could time travel, you had to program their exact mass into the machine, or bad things would happen]

[????? A massive industrial scale, a metallic platform wide enough for both of us to stand on, with a label boasting that it could weigh up to a thousand pounds, to a precision of a single gram.


?????

"Now. Kayla." [Video-Kayla's voice was suddenly stern, serious] "I really hope you went to the room I told you to. We picked this room because there's food in the fridge – food for a team that's not on-site today, so it won't change anyone's timeline. You need to eat, <em>now</em>. Suppressing our hunger was a stupid decision. It was smart when we were [????? captive/only run], but it was stupid to keep hiding it for hours after we could have asked Marvin to get food for us. Marvin, if she doesn't want to eat, you have to –"

But [the Kayla with me had already flung open the fridge and was stuffing her face. And the other Marvin had realized it. He mumbled "She's probably already doing it"]

"Oh God damn it, you're right, she's probably not even listening to me. Listen, uh… Marvin? Marvin, make sure she doesn't eat more than half of what's in that fridge, she'll vomit. Ask me how I know. She can eat half now, and half… maybe an hour from now ?????"

[The Kayla with me was glaring back at her indignantly. "I AM listening" she tried to say amid mouthfuls of food, humiliated rage from having her flaws pointed out in front of me, by someone whose opinion she couldn't possibly deny. She pointedly started dividing everything in the fridge into two equal piles – well, three piles, one of which was all the animal products]

[After she forced herself to stop eating, possibly Marvin trying to make conversation to distract her:]

"Are you vegan?"

[Physicality] "[explanation of how the captives were fed]"

[I was in awe] "You were literally starving, and you still refused [food]?"

She answered with a single word. "Yes." [And in that word, I could feel/but she felt that word with/[enormous] pride/smoldering hatred. The will to destroy those who had wronged her, no matter what was thrown in her way. I thought back to the rifle she was carrying in the video,. She had

?????

The Kayla in the video was still talking, almost forgotten behind us. I skipped back to where we had left off.

"– she needs to be eating about 4000 calories per day. I'm not joking, we looked it up. There was research in the 1940s – the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, you can look it up – where people volunteered to go on a starvation diet, so that humankind could learn what it takes to help someone recover from starvation. And that's what they found out – you need about 4000 calories. Now, I don't want you to tell me how many calories things are. I don't want to know, diet culture kills people. But you – Marvin – you told me you've tried dieting a few times yourself, so you know this stuff, and you can help. ????? you'll need to stock up for that when you go shopping later. But we can't do that yet, first we have to tell you the time travel rules."

<bigbreak>

?????

"They've got time. We should explain this from the beginning"

"Do we need to? We're going to give them our notes, right?"

"Yeah, but we wrote them for <em>us</em>."

"They <em>are</em> us!"

"I don't understand half the comments I wrote on my own code two years ago.


?????


"We went back in time, just like you're about to do," she said. "We went back in time over and over. And we were careful. We made sure not to let our own past selves see us, or do anything that would change what happened to them. We didn't let anyone use the time machines except for us. And we – <em>I</em> – killed the scientists who created them."

[????? An expression of unmistakable pride ????? The revelation, already somewhat expected due to the gun and blood, that the Kayla in the video had killed real, living people. I felt disturbed by it/dissociated, feeling at a distance from things. But the Kayla crouching next to me was watching with rapt attention. In awe/admiration of the version of herself who had succeeded (?). The promise that killing those people – the ones who had held her captive – was within her power.]

"But somehow, we must have made a mistake. [????? When we were done killing them, we noticed that the original Kayla and Marvin hadn't gone back in time the way we had. Somehow, they must have seen one of the changes we made. And so they made different choices. They were still arguing about what to do. They were supposed to go back in time to become us, but if we let them go back in time ?????, they would become a <em>new</em> version of us. They would do different things than we did. And everything <em>we</em> did would be forgotten by history.

"And worse, they would meet the same fate we did. Because in the new timeline, with them instead of us, the first Kayla and Marvin <em>wouldn't</em> see the same changes we made. They'd be different again. It would be an endless loop of them almost winning, then having it all wiped away again.

"But there's a way to fix it. Reggie had some notes on his computer – God damn Reggie, I thought he was evil like the rest of them, but maybe it's more complicated. The last thing he did before he died – literally while I was shooting all of them – he wrote… well, you can look at it." Video-Kayla held something up to the camera – a slightly crumpled sticky note, with some gibberish hastily scrawled across it in ballpoint pen. And under the gibberish, it said, "LAPTOP PASSWORD – TIME TRAVELERS YOU NEED THIS".

"So we looked on his laptop. We found a file full of notes. And the notes, they said how you could make a stable loop. So that's what we're trying to do now. That's where you come in. We've gone back in time again, and we're going to send you this video, and the notes, and some other files. And then after you go back in time, you can send the same files again, to yourself. Marvin made a script that you can use, to send them at the exact same time we're sending them. And then things will be the same for the next version of you – the same as they are for the first version of you. We'll be gone – we might be already gone when you hear this – but <em>you</em> don't have to disappear."


[????? "So the first thing you need to keep in mind – you don't want to change your past, but right now, you ARE the past version. So that means you don't want to BE changed. Which basically means, don't look at anything you don't have to. If you look at something, and then you go back and change it, that's a problem. But if you didn't look at it, it's fine to change it. Of course, after you've gone back in time <em>once</em>, you'll be the future for one version of you, but the past for others. The rule is – you can always look at what your past selves are doing, but you don't want to look at anywhere you think your future selves might be.]
