Before I start telling you what I remember, I'd like to be clear about one thing. I don't want you to think of me as "<em>the real</em> Marvin Fitzroy", or "<em>the original</em> Marvin Fitzroy", or anything like that. Your brain will want to, because I'm the one you know about – the one telling you the story. But time travel doesn't make those distinctions. Even the Marvins that don't exist anymore, they were just as real as I am.

And because this is <em>my</em> version of the story, I can only tell you the part I know. For Kayla, it started six years earlier, when the scientists first started using her. For the scientists, it started another seven years before that, when they published the paper they didn't realize was about time travel. For Ontoh and Nochli, it started at a time that's harder to explain – several months in the future, or thousands of years in the past, depending how you look at it.

But for me, it started when I was hired by the Whitney University Neuroscience Department.

Even then, they were obviously more than just an academic department. My office wasn't on-campus – it was in the old Riker Hospital building, which I'd thought was abandoned when Riker moved to a new, modernized facility four years earlier. But now, my new employers owned the entire building. And my paycheck came from a company called NeuroSci Innovations, which no one had ever heard of. I should have known there was something underhanded going on. But I was in a hurry to get a new job – I'd just been laid off at a dying tech startup. I was short on cash, and my new pay was good. <em>Suspiciously</em> good. Even a prestigious research university like Whitney wouldn't normally have the budget to pay competitive, market rates for a computer graphics engineer. But that's what they were paying me. And I didn't say no to it.

An abandoned hospital wasn't a normal workplace for a software engineer. Even the commute was desolate – this part of ?????city [something-burg?] had never really recovered from the hurricane a few years back. People had lived in these destroyed homes once, but after the evacuation, most of them had seen the writing on the wall. Or in this case, the writing by the state scientific commission, about the severe flooding that would soon be commonplace, in these low-lying zones close to the ocean. Just about the only people left were the old-timers who would rather die in the homes they'd grown up in… and the few poor souls who were still in denial about climate change.

The hospital was as dismal as its surroundings. In the parking lot, a power pole sported a ragged flyer from the City Council, asking residents to report any sightings of urban coyotes or coyote scat, and warning them not to leave food out in the open. The building itself towered seven stories above, square and anonymous. The brick face could've been anything – a hospital, an office building, a prison.

Inside, it had only been partly re-colonized by its new owners. Shiny new surveillance cameras were retrofitted onto aging walls; new electronic locks put the upper levels tantalizingly off-limits.  The wide-open lobby, our only view of all seven floors, revealed scattered bits of activity upstairs. Some of the upper hallways saw the bustle of doctors and grad students, doing their unknown research; other halls sat dark and unused, as abandoned as they'd ever been. On the first floor, a respectable attempt had been made to clean up the treatment rooms and convert them into offices, but in many places, racks of unused medical equipment had simply been pushed into back corners to gather dust.

Getting set up in the makeshift office was an adventure in itself. First of all, every single computer in the office had a physical blue-green color filter glued over the monitor. My new boss told me we were working on making an animated color pattern for some kind of psychology research, and the color filters were for "ethics". The pattern could theoretically have psychological effects on anyone who saw it, so the scientists didn't want to expose anyone except the intended test subjects. At least, that's what they'd told my boss. So we were doing all the prototyping using color-swapped versions of the actual pattern.

"What happens if you look at it?" I asked, curious.

"I don't know, probably nothing. But they're huge sticklers for ethics. I thought they had to be joking, but some of the other guys looked at it, and they were fired before I got back from my lunch break. And they put the blue things on the screens the same day, so now you can't see it even if you put the right color codes in. <em>Ethics</em>…" He smiled and shook his head. And at the time, I laughed along with him. But in hindsight, it hits differently. It feels silly to have scoffed at that level of caution, given the much stricter precautions we needed later. And even though I'd thought he was charmingly cynical, neither of us had caught the actual lie: These scientists had never cared about ethics. To them, "ethics" was just a convenient excuse – an excuse that they could use whenever it meant doing what they wanted to do anyway, and put away whenever it didn't.



[Physical description of the pattern in blue/green, vaguely like a hypnotic spiral but no spiral, just wavy; "it was kind of hypnotic, but like, not anything special". "The Pattern didn't mean much to me at first. It wasn't like a hypnotic spiral, it was just wavy stripes, almost like a bar code but with curved lines, all in blue and green – although of course those weren't the real colors. My programming work involved making the waves move around and change thickness, more like "1990s screensaver" than "spooky hypnosis".]

"What are the real colors?" I asked him once.

He chuckled. "Don't forget, I'm a programmer too. I know how programmers are. If I tell you the real colors, you'll want to look at it yourself. Call me a killjoy, but I'd rather keep my job." His smile wavered, as he glanced at the surveillance camera watching over us. Quietly, he added, "Pro tip, this Dr. Fuller doesn't know how to work with programmers. If he gives you something easy that he doesn't know is easy, just say 'I'll work on it' and make it take two days. Then you can use the time to work on the hard things he doesn't know are hard. Don't do anything too fast, he'll just raise his standards. Just keep your head down and give him what he expects, and it'll be a cushy job."

<bigbreak> 

But if I have one flaw, it's this: Once I get curious about something, I can't look away from it. Maybe if they had never installed all the locks, they could have kept their secrets. Maybe I would have treated it like any other boring job. But if there were locks, there was something to keep hidden. What was all this security for? What was the Pattern, really? What were they researching? [I wanted to know what was on the locked-off floors – upstairs, where the scientists worked ["I couldn't resist the mystery of"], and even more intriguingly, the basement levels, where an actual steel security door greeted you as soon as you can out of the elevator [I wanted to know what was on the locked-off floors, what all this security was for / the locks just made me more curious / what was the Pattern, really? What was on the locked off floors? Why was it so important to keep everything secure? ?????]

I wasn't a genius hacker, but in truth, very few security breaches are works of genius. The typical breach starts with a careless mistake – a company cutting corners to save a quick buck, a programmer writing a bug that <em>usually</em> doesn't break anything, a sysadmin leaving a secret in a public-access folder. And it ends with someone noticing.

I started by googling the brand name of the security company. It was easy to find: Every lock and camera proudly displayed their logo, <em>PanoptiLock</em>. They sold expensive, high-tech security equipment, and their marketing looked pretty impressive. They had police chiefs recommending them; they had videos where people tried to break their locks with sledgehammers and hacksaws, and failed. If you were a normal person, and you suddenly had a million dollars and needed to secure a building, you would find PanoptiLock.

But I wasn't a normal person. I was plugged into the security community. Before long, I had found the YouTube videos – reviews by people who <em>actually</em> knew security, amateur teardowns of PanoptiLock products. And the reviews… well, they weren't terrible. PanoptiLock hadn't made every mistake in the book. But they had made enough.

Every PanoptiLock camera shipped with the same default password. At work, after I'd seen the reviews, I idly tried that default password. I didn't really expect it to work – whoever installed them should have changed the password before connecting them to the network. But they hadn't. It worked.

With very little fanfare, I was "in".

When you find a vulnerability like this, you have two choices. What you're <em>supposed</em> to do is report it to whoever is responsible, so they can fix it. What you're <em>not</em> supposed to do – what I did do – is exploit it yourself. But I couldn't resist. I wasn't trying to be some sort of citizen-investigator, finding what they were up to, I was just doing it because I was curious. Because I <em>could</em>. What Reginald would later call "a profoundly amoral decision".

I didn't dare look at the cameras on work time, at first. Instead, I wrote a little script to download all of the recordings and save them on a USB drive. At home, [in my studio apartment, I had plenty of time to take my time and review all of the bits, looking at them on the big screen of my gaming PC. I skipped back and forth to the videos, trying to find the interesting parts]

[But at the end of hours of searching, I'd come up empty. /But what I found… Was nothing./Was notable for its failure to tell me anything. I saw workers and offices and medical equipment, chemistry labs where I overhear technical conversations beyond my understanding, but somehow, I didn't remember anyone saying what the overall purpose of the place was. I hadn't seen the Pattern a single time; had anyone even mentioned it?.]

[Little did I know that I had already seen the Pattern, already been affected by it?]


[I thought I just had to make my search more systematic. I tried to write down what was happening in each room, so I could get a sense of the big picture. Over the coming days, I made it a whole little project, using motion-detection software to find the interesting parts of the videos, and image classifiers to write down what was there. If you don't know what an image classifier is, it's one of those AI tools that they use at places like Google – you put in an image, and it gives you a bad guess about what it's a picture of. Nowadays, if you know a bit of programming, you can just <em>download</em> a "pre-trained model" and classify thousands of images overnight. And if you have a bit of money, you can pay a cloud service to run the same program on dozens of computers at once, in a datacenter somewhere, and send the results back to you, to get it done much faster. So that's what I did.

[seemed like Reggie was in two places at once, I thought there was like an error or something. Go ahead and laugh – you already know it was time travel. But at the time, my brain refused to make the connection.]

[????? If it wasn't for the image classifiers, I would never have noticed, I would have just glanced past and assumed there wasn't anything there. Even after it said "child on bed", I still just assumed the classifier was wrong, like usual. But because I was keeping notes on each camera, it eventually became conspicuous that those few rooms were the ones that were still blank. I sat at home staring at the images, wondering what was in them that made them get classified as children, when there obviously weren't any children in the pictures. Or, as I eventually began to wonder – why my brain couldn't explain what they were instead of children.]

[I sent one of the photos to a friend, who would normally have always gotten back to me, and he just ignored it]

[????? I started managing to catch glimpses of the children while they were being transported. It didn't look consensual. Was this secretly a mental hospital? Was this human trafficking?

[????? I looked up this place, but hardly found anything – almost all the search results for the address where from back when it was Riker Hospital, the only one more recently was a deleted post. Certainly it wasn't being advertised as a place of medical treatment for children; it got harder and harder to think of innocent explanations for what I'd seen, but I hesitated. How could I explain it? Would they retaliate against me?]

????? [I don't know what I would have done if time had just gone on, if Kayla hadn't forced the issue. Would I have tried to report them? It wouldn't have worked; whatever I tried, it wouldn't have put me in the place I needed to be, when I needed to be there.

[hype Fuller somehow, followed by: the morning of the day when it happened [" I didn't yet know how important that day was going to be – day that would determine the course of human history"/"I did not yet know that it was the day we would later call <em>Day One</em>, the day that would change the course of human history"], Fuller greeted me in the morning [chatting with Marvin in his condescendingly encouraging way]. I got up the courage to ask him "what do we actually do on the upper floors", as if it was just innocent curiosity. "It's very cutting-edge research you're supporting. Very technical" "try me, I can understand a lot of technical things". He explained, but indeed I couldn't understand it ("my eyes glazed over", but the internal version of that?). And then he clapped me on the shoulders, encouraging "keep up the good work". But then I had the presence of mind to look back at the security camera recording of the conversation, and saw how I reacted to his explanation – I could barely remember it at all, and he had a little smirk on his face, knowing full well that he could get away with saying whatever he wanted, because my brain would censor what he was saying]

<bigbreak>

This is what happened on Day One.

The ?????phorin Experiment was scheduled for 11:00 AM. At 9:56, two assistants unlocked the room where Kayla was being held, and told her she was to be taken to the experiment room. She complied. ????? Kayla, who was physically weak and stumbling, accidentally-on-purpose knocked one of the assistants into a ?????/Kayla was already physically weak and stumbling, and they knew this; this gave her an excuse to… ?????, vials of medicine shattered on the floor. Once they had strapped her into the fMRI machine, there was a hasty discussion. Dr. Fuller would be very angry, they agreed; it was imperative that this mess be gone before he learned of it. At 10:05, they agreed to split up – one to fetch replacements, the other to stay and clean. But as soon as the second assistant was alone, he realized he had no broom or dustpan to clear the broken glass. He glanced at Kayla; he must have known it would break protocol to leave her unattended. But she was fully restrained, lying motionless in the machine. Surely nothing would happen in just a few minutes. Surely Dr. Fuller's anger was a more urgent concern. This resulted in Kayla being left unattended for a total of six minutes, starting at 10:07. Only the room's security cameras could see her, and no one was monitoring them at the time – at least, not in the first timeline.

26 seconds from the moment the door closed, Kayla had fully freed herself from the restraints. Over the next 18 seconds, she rushed about the room, gathering the things she would need. By 10:09 AM, she was out the door. ????? sped down the hallway, following the exit signs to find ????? stairs.

And that's where I came in. At that moment, I just so happened to be <em>watching</em> the camera that she ran past. [Happened to glance through the other cameras right after I was done watching my conversation with Fuller?] Of course, at the time, I had no idea of what had just happened before that. All I knew was what I could see on the camera. And what I saw – the way my mind first interpreted it – was a frightened, teenage girl, wearing nothing but a hospital gown, holding a scalpel in front of her like a weapon. In the twelve seconds she was in view, she entered the lobby on the fourth floor, looked quickly around her, and crept to the nearest stairs, then disappeared downwards. My mind jumped to an explanation: she was a captive, trying to escape the building. I was almost right. Right in the ways that mattered.

I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, but I'm proud of how I reacted in that moment. My worst fears about this place were realized, and I knew that if I didn't take action – immediately – then I would never forgive myself. If I did nothing, I thought, Kayla was going to step out of the stairs onto the lobby floor, in plain view of half a dozen people – people I could see from my view of the camera, who she couldn't see from where she was standing. [????? I couldn't just let it happen.]

I knew I had to [make sure my actions wouldn't be visible on the security cameras later, and it would be suspicious to only turn off the ones that would be relevant] At 10:10 AM, I turned off every security camera in the building, stood up, and sprinted for the stairs. [????? I turned off the security cameras – not just the ones we were going to go past, because that would be conspicuous, but every security camera in the building.] ????? Cracked open the door and called out softly, "this way! I can help you." ????? Face-to-face with Kayla for the first time.

????? Seeing her face-to-face, ????? her face was gaunt, barely more than skin and bone. One arm clutched a tablet computer to her chest, several smaller objects bundled in a closed fist. At her other side, a bony, trembling hand still clutched the scalpel, as she stood poised on the steps above me, ready to fight or run the moment I proved to be a threat. But if I'd been expecting her to panic when I approached, my expectations were soon shattered. She [????? held still], quickly calculating how much to trust me. My first glimpse of the ruthless intelligence that defined her.

"Why are you helping me?" she asked. Not disbelief. A demand for information.

"I – I only just realized this place is holding people against their will!" I hissed. "Of course I want to do something about that!" [????? She stayed still] "Listen, someone's going to come up the stairs anytime now, I saw it on the cameras! ????? I can hide you in my office ?????

[????? She relented and came down the stairs, in a way that was striking a balance between quickness, keeping hold of the tablet she was carrying, and quietness] "I'm trusting you," she hissed back at me, as she passed through the door I was holding. A harsh whisper, the sound of [????? someone who really doesn't trust you]. Her fist clenched tightly around the handle of the scalpel ????? I might meet a very bloody end if I betrayed her. But she followed me ????? [physical description contrasting Marvin (slightly pudgy, thirty-five-year-old) and Kayla, somewhere in this paragraph]

[????? I talked quickly as we hurried back to my office./We got to my office] "You need to get out of the building, right? I can look at all the security cameras – we can find [????? a way no one's watching, so we can sneak out –] and then I can call the police –" but something in her eyes told me she didn't think the police would save her. "Or I could call someone you trust – or I could drive you to somewhere you think you'll be safe –"

"It won't work," she said. ?????

"What?"

Her words came quickly, low and urgent. "None of that would work! I can't run, they're always waiting for me right after I get away. They have a…"

But as she kept speaking, something bizarre began to happen. There was nothing wrong with her words – they were plain English, they fit together in order – but even as ten seconds passed, then twenty, my brain simply didn't make sense of them. ????? [If I hadn't experienced the stuff I'd experienced earlier, I would have just let her keep talking, I wouldn't have noticed that something was weird was happening that would make me need to interrupt. But my experiences gave me an inkling that I really needed to interrupt her]

"I'm sorry," I interrupted, "I don't understand what you're saying –"

I had been afraid that she ????? wouldn't know what I meant, that I would have to explain how it was that I didn't understand]. But I knew instantly that she had understood. The look that blossomed on her face wasn't confusion or frustration – it was <em>fear</em>. [She knew that she could keep trying to tell me these things, What she desperately needed me to know, but I would never understand, and then her time would run out. Or, as I later understood, that her only option was to do something horrible

[????? When she understood what I had said," a look of fear crossed her face. Not the immediate fear of something being going to jump out at you, but the slow dread of realizing you're trapped in a situation that will give you no choice but to do something horrible] "You – you're really not in on it," she said.

"In on what?" [????? this response shouldn't get its own paragraph, but the earlier ones are okay]

In response, she uttered some more of those words I couldn't understand. But she knew right away that it wasn't working. "Damn it! [I don't want to do this to you! / I didn't take this to use it on an innocent person!]" she said tightly. "But I need you to understand!"

"Do what?!"

[????? She couldn't answer me. she could only steel her resolve to do the thing. She swallowed and steeled her resolve to do whatever it was. Then ????? finally the meaning of the tablet she was carrying was revealed. She lowered it onto the desk, turning the screen to face me, and pressed a button labeled OVERSTIM.]

The next few minutes were a ?????horrifying blur.

On some level, deep in my mind, I understood what my eyes were staring at. It was the animation I'd been working on. The only difference was the color, no longer blue and green, but purple and white. But somehow, the colors reached deep into my brain, gripping my deepest instincts, holding me in a dreamlike state where I couldn't form a coherent thought, [my brain refusing to acknowledge that the Pattern was even there] [an unconscious need to obey a incoherent range of commands] [probably something humiliating from Marvin's past here] [more details referring back to the initial description] ?????

[????? my head still spinning, a stinging sensation in my arm, brain frantically digging through half-formed memories to find any idea of where I was, what had happened in the last hour –]

[????? Finally a fragmented image stayed in place, Kayla crouching in front of me, speaking quickly with an expression of worry on her face, the injector in her hand – I looked back at my stinging arm –, "Is this some kind of mind control?! Did you <em>inject</em> me with something?!!" [????? I freaked out and pulled back]

But then, my mind caught up with the words she had been saying.

"– a time machine, they have a time machine. Tell me when you can understand me. They have a time machine. They have a time machine. Tell me when you can understand –"

And it all fell into place. The ????? Reggie being in 2 places at once. The ????? . "A time machine –" I gasped "– the machine in the [underground floor]"

[Kayla was instantly relieved that I could understand, she rushed to explain] "You were already being mind controlled. Everyone here is, everyone but the scientists in charge. What I did is, I broke the control. The overstim, the ?????cyanosol injections, they're what they tested on me, they're why I can resist it. Everyone else, you can talk about time travel right in front of them and they just stare past you – "

?????

????? The message arrived. A message on my work account. A message from <em>myself</em>. ????? A zip file attached

When your body is in fight-or-flight mode, the time it takes a computer to unpack an archive feels like forever. ????? [????? Hyper focused on the screen, my eyes jumped to 01_WATCH_THIS_FIRST.mp4 the moment it appeared]

Like many an unedited, amateur video, it began in a blur of motion, as its maker tapped the record button on their phone and set the phone down where it would get a good view – a view of a room much like this one, no doubt a conference room somewhere in this very building. [????? It was night though, and the people in the video were Kayla, and me. Marvin.]

But the Kayla in the video was dramatically changed from the Kayla beside me. The desperate look was gone from her eyes, a bit of fat back in her cheeks, standing tall and proud, with an honest-to-God <em>rifle</em> on a sling over one shoulder. She was dressed in a bright, fresh-off-the-shelf jacket and jeans, marred only by splatters of drying blood, which I could only assume were not her own. But despite ????? still a look of deep exhaustion on her face

"Oh God, how do we say this to them?" muttered the Kayla in the video, dead tired, a voice of resignation. She glanced to the side, at my own double, the way someone glances when they're hoping someone else will take charge, so they won't have to do the difficult work themselves.

But my double could not help her. Whatever our duplicates had been through, Kayla had endured it, but Marvin had been emotionally destroyed by it. [????? He had a hollow, haunted look, and the moment he was asked to speak, he broke down completely. He sank down in his seat, sobbing into his hands, completely nonverbal].

Video-Kayla let out a short breath and pulled her eyes away from Marvin, a quiet acknowledgment that she was on her own. [????? Reluctantly,] she looked back at the camera – at us.

"Listen," she said. "We messed up. We caused a paradox, and pretty soon, we're going to cease to exist. And if you don't want the same thing to happen to you, here's what you have to do."
