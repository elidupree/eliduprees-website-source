[Chapter title: It's Safe, Right? My Future Self Told Me So]

[????? Reestablish scene, maybe mention more details here]

She continued in that same, dead-tired voice.

"You need to get to the time machine as soon as you can. Once you go back, you can send this video to yourselves, so it turns into a stable time loop. Don't think about how that works right now, you'll have plenty of time to think about it once you're back at 3 AM. Right now, you have to worry about getting there.

"The time machine is on the lower basement floor. You can take the stairs at the end of the north wing, they're safe because no one uses them all day. But even so, you want to spend as little time in the halls as possible, so you won't get in the way of any of your future selves. And while you're walking there, don't look at anything if you can help it! Keep your head down, don't look in any of the rooms you go past, definitely don't look at other places on the security cameras –"

"– but leave them on!" croaked a voice – my voice, Marvin's voice, speaking for the first time since the video started. It was breathy and breaking, the voice of someone who has been crying for hours, who is only forcing themselves to speak because of a sudden need. "Leave the cameras on! No one ch–" he gasped, before his throat failed him again, lapsing into voiceless breaths.

"– no one checks them until the meeting at 4 PM," video-Kayla finished for him. "He's right – leave them on, but don't look at them. That'll save you a lot of the trouble we had to deal with. But right now, you need to… uh…" she looked to Marvin again. "Damn it, Marv, you know I'll say it wrong if I have to tell them the computer stuff…"

But once you've forced out the first few words, the rest of the words come easier. Marvin lifted his head halfway out of his hands, not quite daring to look directly at the camera. "We – we're going to put this video in a zip file, with – with some other documents. You'll need to copy the whole zip file onto a USB stick so you can bring it back with you. I – I guess you should start copying it now, don't wait for the video to finish, it might take a little while. And then – we – we'll make some instructions for you to print out – so I guess you should start printing those, next, after you start the copy. And then, uh, you'll need to know how to use the time machine…" He kept rambling, feebly going through the motions of telling us what we needed, not really believing in it.

But the Kayla crouching next to me – gaunt, strung tight with terror – had no choice but to believe in it. "Why aren't you doing what he said?" she hissed at me.

Her words knocked me out of my trance. I fumbled through Marvin's instructions, digging a USB drive out of a drawer in my desk, then finding the file to print – 02_print_this_out.png. It was definitely me who had chosen these filenames – practical names, telling me what I needed to know, using two digits out of habit even though the files only went up to ????? "09". It was eerie, seeing my own handiwork on something I had no memory of creating.

There are few things as maddening as being told that you must not look at something, when the thing is all around you. This was supposed to be the easy part: the part where we just walked down the hallway to get where we were going. But video-Kayla's instructions – <em>keep your head down, don't look in any of the rooms</em> – made it a living hell. I couldn't stop myself wanting to look over my shoulder, wondering what was behind every door we passed, in the endless clinical white walls.

To keep my mind off it, I focused on the printout I was holding. The instructions were clear, at least. It started with a map of our route, with little photos of each door we needed to go through, so we couldn't miss them. And again, the note: <em>Don't look around. You don't want to see your future selves, if they're nearby.</em>

"What do you think happens if we see our future selves?" I said nervously.

"I don't know, but it's bad! They said it was bad, and they knew how it works, right?"

An eerie silence descended over us, no sound but our own footsteps. Kayla lurched along, adrenaline stretching the limits of her strength. In the back of my mind, I was itching to make her hurry – terrified that one of the scientists might come up behind us, catch up to us while she was still struggling. But I knew she was going as fast as she could. We had to trust in the video, the promise that no one would come this way today.

"I feel like we're being followed," I muttered.

I shouldn't have said it in front of Kayla. She whipped around, staring back down the corridor, her eyes drilling into every nook and cranny of the white walls.

I couldn't help it – I followed her gaze. But of course, there was nothing there. I shivered. "I-it's just nerves," I said shakily.

"Unless it isn't," she croaked, still looking.

"What?! There's nothing there, you can see there's nothing there! We can't be worrying about every empty hallway, we have to keep moving!"

When Kayla finally tore her eyes away, it was only reluctantly – not satisfied, but forced to admit she couldn't find what she was looking for. The "we have to keep moving" was the part that had convinced her. She faced forwards again, eyes locked on to the exit sign ahead of us.

The stairs weren't any easier. I held the door for Kayla at the top, putting her in front of me on the narrow staircase; I had to wait while she lowered herself, and force myself not to fill the time by looking out the windows. But at last, we got to the bottom – to the steel security door, locking away the basement floors.

Even [in the terrifying situation], I can't deny that I still had a bit of childlike excitement. This steel door had intrigued me for weeks; I was finally getting to sneak into somewhere I truly, absolutely, wasn't supposed to be. And indeed, we could enter now. It had already been unlocked for us, remotely, by the same Marvin who'd sent us the video.

Kayla didn't wait for me to help her; she grabbed the handle herself. But her gesture seemed unusual, even for her weakened state. She gripped the handle underhanded and pulled upwards from the shoulder, leaning backwards, struggling to pull the weight.

I caught the edge of the door to help her. "Is your arm okay?" I asked.

She replied in an irritable singsong – "<em>Polyneuropathy, not-otherwise-specified.</em>" It was the voice of someone who has had to explain the same thing over and over, and is sick of it. "My arms are weak. I get phantom pains. No one knows why."

"Is that – er, is it okay if I ask, uh –" I stumbled over my words.

"I hate when people coddle me!" she snapped. "Ask your question already!"

"Er. Okay. Is that something they did to you? When they experimented on you?"

Evidently, that wasn't the question she expected, because her anger subsided a little. "No," she said. "I've always had this. It's got nothing to do with them, except they're using it as an <em>excuse</em>. Fuller told my parents this was the 'best chance to solve her problem' with all his 'cutting-edge neuroscience'. I don't think he even knew what my problem was before he said he could solve it."

[We'd already gotten down the last short hallway to the final door to the time machine room)

<bigbreak>

The time machine room was huge. The walls and floors had been torn out to make room for the construction, leaving a two-story workspace broken up only by bare steel columns and beams, with bare concrete underneath our feet. The only light came from a set of minimal, glaring work lights high above, casting all the machinery in bright highlights and sharp shadows. The whole place smelled like a machine shop; the sound of our footsteps was eerily absorbed by the huge airspace.

And in the center, on a pedestal of its own… the time machine itself.

We had already seen it in our future selves' instructional video, so its appearance wasn't surprising. But it was one thing to see it on camera, from a distance – and quite another to experience it in person. Its central structure was an 8-foot-tall, gleaming egg of steel, towering above us. It had clearly been built in several pieces, and then bolted together here; bulky steel plates stuck out of the surface where the join-lines were. Electrical cords snaked up and down the egg on all sides, mismatched orange and white, powering components whose purpose I couldn't begin to guess.

It was just sitting there, deceptively inactive. Given what it could do, I would have expected it to look like something from a sci-fi movie, all glowing panels and holograms – not like a bulky antique from the Industrial Revolution. But maybe I <em>should</em> have been more scared by something from the Industrial Revolution. A new invention, nowhere near perfected, but already able to radically alter the world as we knew it… and maybe not for the better. Even the Marvin from the video, sobbing in terror of what would happen to him, hadn't begun to understand the danger we were in.

But we didn't have time to think about that. Our role, for the moment, was to get in and out quickly. The procedure, summarized on the printout, was as follows:

First, I had to proceed to the folding table beside the machine, and open the laptop there – the only 21st-century-looking thing in the whole room. This was the device that actually controlled the machine, by a series of thin, concerningly flimsy-looking signal wires. Once I started running the program, it would ask me for the necessary information.

<pre><code>$ full_process.py
1. Enter mass:</code></pre>

Second, we had to weigh ourselves. We would have to tell the laptop the exact amount of mass to send into the past. The notes weren't too specific about what would happen to that matter – our flesh – if the number was wrong.

For this, there was another device, standing 10 feet away from the giant egg. It was a massive industrial scale – a metallic platform wide enough for both of us to stand on – with a label boasting that it could measure up to 500 kg, to a precision of a single gram. <em>Weigh yourselves on the scale, together,</em> said the printout. <em>It should be around 130 kg. If it's around 140 kg, get off and then weigh yourselves again. There's a glitch where it's sometimes off by 11.2 kg.</em>

When <em>we</em> did this, it got the right answer the first time. Even so, Kayla glared at the scale. "How can it be accurate to the nearest gram if it's sometimes off by eleven kilograms?!"

But when you're a programmer like me, you get used to weird glitches; it would have been more surprising if it <em>did</em> work every time. So I just shrugged and followed the instructions. If I had known the <em>real</em> reason for the extra 11.2 kg, I wouldn't have made it through the day. I would have had a complete breakdown.

<pre><code>2. Enter interval:</code></pre>

This meant how far back in time to go. I dutifully entered "0", which meant "go back as far as possible"; in our case, that meant going back to 3:06 AM.

<pre><code>3. Enter delay:</code></pre>



On one side of the egg, there was a hatch that could open – a place where the egg could be swung open by mechanical arms – and a stepladder to help climb up to it. Once we entered the three "jump parameters" and pressed the button to start the "[jump]", that hatch would open, and we could crawl inside.





[The notes: "shut off your phone before you go back in time, literally take the battery out, it's too much of a paradox risk otherwise"]

[Maybe narrated, but starting with a hook about the scream: Marvin climbs in first, leaning against the worryingly dark interior curve of the egg, like climbing into a cave. Kayla climbs after, having a bit of a hard time balancing as she tries to duck through the narrow metal entrance. She concentrates to do it right, but her muscles are shaking too much and they fail her, and she stumbles forward. I panicked and caught her shoulders]

[Any noise in such close quarters, with [materials] around you, echoes back and multiplies itself. Kayla's scream was unexpected and hurt my ears a lot. Just as quickly, it was cut short]

"Oh my God, are you okay –"

[, and she was panting and getting her balance. "It's fine, it's just my neuropathy, just don't touch my shoulders"]

[The hatch closed behind us, swung into a place by a mechanical arm. There's something unusual about a space that's genuinely totally dark: you go through your whole life thinking darkness is when the lights are turned off, but there's always a bit of light sneaking in, from the streetlights, the moon, the stars, sneaking around your curtains, through your eyelids, helping you navigate by on an unconscious level. But the solid metal of the egg completely shut out, leaving only the afterimages early following my eyes wherever I looked, just Kayla's short breaths, her clammy hand clutching my arm to position herself,]

"God, I'm so sorry –"

"It's only pain," she growled.

[But I had recognized that scream. It hadn't been a scream of when you're startled, it was the one you scream when you're in unimaginable pain, using the full force of your lungs. I'd only heard a scream like that once before, when one of my nieces [mistake as a 12-year-old had to be rushed to hospital: crashed a bike "going down the same hill she'd gone down hundreds of times, one moment everything is fine and the next moment], one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. But to Kayla this level of pain was normal, as if it was just an annoyance she had to deal with]

[The video hadn't warned us about this, because in their timeline, it never happened – Kayla had climbed in first, while Marvin was nervous]

[a low humming built up, then suddenly cut out, with a slight change of pressure in my ears. The hatch opened, onto the same room, but different. The lights were out]

?????

[Night worker walks by muttering "there's a ghost, I swear" about the circuit breaker being tripped; I could indulge in retrospective narration about the circuit breaker rather than forcing it into the worker's mouth]

"Okay," I whispered. "[They are far enough away]"

[We opened the door and quickly crossed the darkened hall into [Simons workshop.] Following the instructions on the increasingly crumpled paper [which had been shoved in and out of my pocket?] I plugged in the USB stick, and brought up the video again, then skipped ahead to the part we'd been at]

?????

"Now. Kayla." [Video-Kayla's voice was suddenly stern, serious] "I really hope you went to the room I told you to. We picked this room because there's food in the fridge – [and this is the private break room for Simon, who is not working today and only shows up for the meeting], so it won't change anyone's timeline. You need to eat, <em>now</em>. Suppressing our hunger was a stupid decision. It was smart when we were [????? captive/on the run], but it was stupid to keep hiding it for hours after we could have asked Marvin to get food for us. Marvin, if she doesn't want to eat, you have to –"

But [the Kayla with me had already flung open the fridge and was stuffing her face. And the other Marvin had realized it. He mumbled "She's probably already doing it" ("you didn't see yourself rush for that fridge the first time we found it.]

"Oh damn it, you're right, she's probably not even listening to me. Listen, uh… Marvin? Marvin, make sure she doesn't eat more than half of what's in that fridge, she'll vomit. Ask me how I know. She can eat half now, and half… maybe an hour from now ?????"

[The Kayla with me was glaring back at her indignantly. "I AM listening" she tried to say amid mouthfuls of food, humiliated rage from having her flaws pointed out in front of me, by someone whose opinion she couldn't possibly deny. She pointedly started dividing everything in the fridge into two equal piles – well, three piles, one of which was all the animal products]

[After she forced herself to stop eating (staring at the food, but held back by the unbreakable laws inside her head), possibly Marvin trying to make conversation to distract her:]

"Are you vegan?"

[Physicality] "[explanation of how the captives were fed; I think Kayla should mention what vegan ethics mean to her here, although not in detail]"

[I was in awe] "You were literally starving, and you still refused [food]?"

She answered with a single word. "Yes." [And in that word, I could feel/but she felt that word with/[enormous] pride/smoldering hatred. The will to destroy those who had wronged her, no matter what was thrown in her way. I thought back to the rifle she was carrying in the video,. She had

?????

The Kayla in the video was still talking, almost forgotten behind us. I skipped back to where we had left off.

"– she needs to be eating about 4000 calories per day. I'm not joking, we looked it up. There was research in the 1940s – the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, you can look it up – where people volunteered to go on a starvation diet, so that humankind could learn what it takes to help someone recover from starvation. And that's what they found out – you need about 4000 calories. Now, I don't know how many calories things are. Diet culture kills people, I never wasted my time on it. But you – Marvin – you told me you've tried dieting a few times yourself, so you know this stuff, and you can help. ????? you'll need to stock up for that when you go shopping later. But we can't do that yet, first we have to tell you the time travel rules."

?????

[Kayla puts on Simon's jacket/etc (does she need Marvin's help? Video-Kayla admonish her to accept Marvin's help?) And N95 masks (Simon has them for industrial reasons); Kayla insists they wear them ("how stupid would it be if we win and then I die of COVID because you didn't wear a mask? Put it on already"; There've been a few cases, the only reason they didn't spread further is the good ventilation); narration about how Marvin was aware that the pandemic was still dangerous (explain the pandemic a bit for the future audience), but didn't wear one because it was too hard to explain himself to everyone else in the office, who wasn't wearing them ("it was kind of a relief to be with someone who was expecting me to wear one; I guess if you are easily influenced by the opinions of the people around you, you need to surround yourself with people who have correct opinions")]

"They've got time. We should explain this from the beginning"

"Do we need to? We're going to give them our notes, right?"

"Yeah, but we wrote them for <em>us</em>."

"They <em>are</em> us!"

"I don't understand half the comments I wrote on my own code two years ago.
