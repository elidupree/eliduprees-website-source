????? We owe it to Aster to let them use the antidote

[reg being different than Aster - deeper, gravelly voice, look of fear - in all the time we'd known Aster, we'd never seen them afraid, not even when the gun was being pointed at them. but Reginald was deeply afraid]

"I'm dissociating, you need to take me back to my office –"

"I'm sorry. We can't let you leave until we've explained what's going on"

?????

[At some point later: "what in God's name has Aster done with our back?? After all the work I did to try to learn good posture"]

[Reginald feeling utterly betrayed by Aster; as a grave whisper, "God damn it, Aster, what have you done?"]

[For the sixty years since the Monster Study and the Nuremberg Code, the field of neuroscience has been trying to earn back some semblance of not being morally bankrupt, and this has set that back enormously]

[K+M offer excuses for Aster and Reginald argues against them
– "they were planning to get rid of Fuller" "
– "they thought Fuller might kill them" "well isn't that convenient for them! A convenient excuse to go on and do exactly what they would have wanted to get away with anyway! They should have risked our life"
– "They could have walked away" "if they'd walked away then I'd be dead because they didn't do time travel" "the fact that they could undo the deaths is why Fuller felt comfortable escalating the experiments in the first place! This is why you [bangs fist on table] never compromise with evil!"
– At some point, "'Reggie' is only a name for my intimates, I can't believe Aster gave it out to everyone"]

[With deeply aggrieved conviction] "If I get any say in this at all, we are going to have some god damn <em>ethics</em> around here."

[Chapter break, "the ethics board"]


[Reginald saying how everything up to this point has been an utter mess ethics wise, including some harsh words for Marvin's choices ("profoundly amoral act"/I hung my head/"at least you have the decency to be ashamed") and saying Kayla was "excused but not justified" (there is a difference between a justification and an excuse! We can excuse Kayla's [brutal murder of a man who had already surrendered] because [of her natural, extreme feelings about the situation he had put her in], but I will not sit here and allow you to justify it. More specifics, not sure of relative order:]

"[Marvin spied on innocent people.] Some of whom were children, I might add –"

[Need to fit in around here: discussion of Marvin delaying several days before doing anything about it even once he knew about the children,. "I was going to report it," I said, but I knew I wasn't sure if I really would have.]

[Kayla defensive of Marvin's spying because it led to her rescue]

"Did he know that?" Reginald demanded. ????? "[Did he know they were evil when he started]"

[Kayla defensive some more – "of course he knew they were evil! They put surveillance cameras all over the place, they turned this building into the goddamn Panopticon! Even if they hadn't [done monk consensual experiments] they would still be evil –"]

But I knew that Reginald was right. [I hadn't thought about it at all – I was just lucky] I hung my head.

"At least you have the decency to be ashamed," said Reginald brusquely.






"Are you vegan?" Kayla cut in.

"I happen to enjoy a good steak on occasion," said Reginald [physicality: "Reginald sniffed", haughty-ish, sarcastic excuse-me tone].

Kayla [settled a little, not trying to press the issue but not feeling like Reginald's judgment was as much of a threat]

Reginald [understood the implication; implicitly, he recognized it as a threat to him being taken seriously]. "Are you going to [say I'm evil because I'm not vegan?]" [With a incredulous tone – a couple degrees less severe than "voice dripping with skepticism"]

Kayla shrugged. "Your lifestyle requires the murder of sapient beings," she said. Her tone wasn't accusatory – it was the tone of someone who is discussing the plain facts. "[You have no more right to judge than any of us]"

Reginald [got back on top of things]. "Even if I take that to be true, it only illustrates my point. If none of us are morally pure, then that is why we cannot simply defer to any one person's judgment, but must actively [work together to be rigorously protected against our individual flaws]"


[We need to get more, responsible, people, to have a proper ethics board. Wait a minute, we can't ethically bring in anyone because they can't give informed consent!]





If you were involved with the University of all, it was hard not to know about Dr. Ethel Wright.

One of the University's most respected and prolific physicists, she had authored and co-authored hundreds of papers in her long career. She was one of those people who simply never stops: Even in her old age, she was constantly moving on to the next project, the next ?????. She was old enough to have been the first woman on the physics faculty, and then later, the first woman head-of-department, a position she still held thirty years later.

I sat down with her in her office [physical description; she had arrived several hours before the 4 PM meeting, so we had time; she didn't know I was there to judge her]

"I'm a writer," I lied blandly. [I told her that Dr. Fuller had hired me, to prepare to have a favorable story to release to the public if we ever ended up in the public eye, and so now I was going around and talking to all of the scientists to have good background material]. "Don't worry, I'm 'in the know'," I said with a little wink [Probably not suave at all].

[She was a little surprised, but not unfavorable to the idea. I started with easy questions, learning a long story of interesting details about her history with the University]

?????

[An experiment involving an iron vessel, but the results were very confusing, and she kept forgetting to follow up on it]

"At that time I had a great deal of worry, as you can imagine, that age was catching up with me. [I have always defined my personal value based on the abilities of my mind, so losing that is like losing myself]. [But I thought about it in an analytical way, and it was conspicuous that the problem only appeared on this specific project – for reasons I'm sure you are aware of]"

?????

[Somehow I kept coming back to it, and even wrote the paper. But I didn't understand what was happening until a chance conversation with Re– ahem, with Dr. Nenge." I had the distinct impression that she was using his surname to show respect, since I was a stranger, but that she would normally call him Reggie, out of affection. Him? Them? She had probably been talking to Aster, actually[, they just hadn't come out to her]. "?????

"[He brought me to Dr. Fuller and they did some tests, showing me a series of chemical formulas and asking me to explain them, to show that my mind was normally functioning, and then showing me another one that I couldn't understand] It was very confusing to me at the time, but now I understand that they were showing me the formula for the argonization of iron. Dr. Nenge had derived it from our paper. Dr. Fuller could read it normally, because to him, the formula was laughable, a chemical impossibility. But for me, I would have understood it, because I had seen the results of our experiments. So it triggered the self-censoring effect.

?????

And then I came to the [big question that was the biggest purpose of this talk]. Keeping my voice casual, I continued, "how do you feel about the children?"

[Instantly icy] "Dr. Fuller didn't send you," she said [crisply? no, feeling-threatened-ly? no, more restrained than either].

?????

[She tries to call Doctor Fuller, the phone rings and rings – or is Marvin carrying the phone right now?] "

[Marvin didn't expect to be angry, but seeing that Dr. Wright knew about the children and tried to cover it up makes him start saying things in a somewhat angry way]

?????

"I've never met you before, but you recognize my face," [said Kayla grimly]. "Seen photos of your test subjects, have you? Maybe through a surveillance camera?"

["I… I cannot deny ????? I didn't want Fuller to do this,"]

["You didn't do anything about it"]

["but he was my only way/for sixty years I have defined myself by what I can do with my mind, do you understand what it's like for me to know how some mysterious adversary has been taking that away from me?"]

["How many other people's lives were you going to let be destroyed for that?"]

?????

She bowed her head. "Is this my judgment, then?"

"We are not God," I said, a bit reproachfully.

"Speak for yourself," said Kayla grimly, still poised to draw the rifle [the moment she chose]. But she knew she was in control of the situation. She had no intention of killing Ethel Wright in cold blood, but she wanted her to be afraid. She wanted her to ????? [experience the ????? that she had experienced? Understand how much her life was on the line, and Kayla was only reluctantly granting her mercy?] "<em>Unfortunately</em>, [we still need something from you, to protect us from something far worse than you are, so don't have the luxury to give you what you deserve. So you get to take the antidote]"







[simon didn't show up early, so we decided to confront him in the meeting room. Physical description of the meeting room, with the giant table with screens built into it]

[The others interrogate Simon about the experimentation victims, but he plausibly claims he didn't know anything, not-entirely-convincingly claims that obviously he thinks it's horrible now that he knows about it; they angrily argue in circles a bit, not able to prove anything. Marvin interrupts:]

"You're the one who wrote the code for the time machine, right?"

"Uh, yeah?" [Simon looked back at me in a sort of wary way, unconsciously trying to figure out whether I was a threat or just Some Guy. I didn't usually get that look, so it was surprising, but he WAS basically being interrogated]

"We'll all forgive you if you just get in the time machine and go back in time by exactly 50 minutes."

Simon's eyes darted back and forth between the others. Reginald was protesting that he had never agreed to this, but Kayla had a quiet, intense look; she knew exactly what I was doing, and loved it. "Uh," Simon said to the group at large, "there's got to be a catch, right? There's no way something like that doesn't have a catch. Right?"

[I showed him on the screens built into the table, the code that said "<code>if dur > 50:</code>" and "<code>if dur < 50:</code>". Even after I pointed out it, he didn't realize what it meant at first. "What happens if the duration is exactly 50?" He thought about it a little, then gulped]

["Come on, I'm just a beginner, I was the only one 'in the know' who knew how to code, so I had to do all of it"]

["Of course it's okay for a beginner to make mistakes, but you KNEW you were a beginner, and you <em>chose to put your code into a machine responsible for people's life and death</em>! You're like the engineers responsible for the Therac-25!" I was already standing and roaring/it's so easy to get angry at other people for flaws that you've only just recognized in yourself]

But of course, Simon didn't know about the Therac-25 either. So I explained it. This time, I didn't spare any of the details. I told him how ?????, how ?????, how ????? [don't actually describe it to the reader, just say that I told gruesome things to be characters]. [Simon had completely lost his cool [ability to act defensive], looked like he was going to throw up. Kayla and Reginald were looking on in horrified anger that this had happened]

Only Ethel Wright seemed unaffected by the details. But of course, she had been a physicist for sixty years. She had grown up in the aftermath of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and lived through the entire Cold War. The "demon core" incident, and every other nuclear criticality incident in history, had happened during her lifetime. Whenever [humanity discovered something new], they would use it to kill each other on purpose, to kill each other by accident, and to kill each other through negligence. This was not news to her.

?????

[I'm going to completely redesign the time machine, and you're going to help me. I'm going to do it using software best practices, unit testing, etc. I'm going to rewrite it in Rust!". The phrase "rewrite it in Rust" was a bit of a meme. Rust was another programming language, more modern, much better for writing reliable programs. Some people over-idealized it, like rewriting things in Rust would fix everything, but it was genuinely a better tool. Even if you used Rust, you still had to be careful, but Rust would <em>help</em> you be careful.]



[Ethics board in session – everyone is here]



[Also, is going back in time murder? Kayla says we SHOULD consider the idea that we are murdering and/or torturing billions of people by going back in time even once. So they have to talk about the basis of their moral system. Maybe Reginald says "when I said ethics, I didn't necessarily mean we needed to go deep into moral philosophy"/?????/"I guess maybe we do need to go deep into moral philosophy… I suppose we are not short of [he said the word with absolute disdain] <em>time</em> for such a discussion"… So what is the fundamental basis of morality?. Someone says that suffering is bad and satisfaction is good, and it's the total amount of suffering and satisfaction that makes the world good and bad. How do you tell whether to Something is murder? Well, the reason murder is bad is because it causes people to suffer]

"But then destroying the entire universe would be a morally neutral act" [because no one suffers afterwards]

"Yes. Destroying the entire universe is a morally neutral act."

[Ethics of going back in time and repeating someone's suffering – does the suffering count twice, or once, or zero times? Ontoh says it only counts if it isn't reverted]

[Something like [I feel like I've forgotten the proper way to state this though]: Moral statements generally runs from someone considering two possible ways things could go and decide that they like one of them better than the other, yes? But if you destroy the entire universe, there is no one who can make that comparison]



[Ethics of reengineering the phrenochondria to make people stop abusing each other; ethics of removing them (removing them is nonconsensual mind control, but leaving them in is also nonconsensual mind control)]



[maybe somewhere while discussing the "morality of a god" thing – "then we are a necessary evil"

"Believing yourself to be a good person, and believing yourself to be an evil person, are both just ways of avoiding responsibility for your choices. [What's important is the process of looking for the best option available, and when you tell yourself a just-so story about what kind of a moral agent you are, you settle into a habit of not evaluating the options]"






[sometime with talking to Ontoh, not sure of ordering]

[K : this makes no sense, if you existed for septillions of subjective years, how are you not ahead of us in technology, haven't space travelled, etc.?

But it was already making sense to me. "'Work expands to fill the time available'," I quoted.

"What?"

"If you had a trillion dollars, you wouldn't care whether something cost one dollar or a thousand dollars, would you? You could spend a thousand dollars every second and still be a trillionaire. So in Salnthu, they had no reason to care whether something took one second or a thousand years, because they could make a thousand years ago by in an instant. Why make a faster computer when you can just]




[sometime with talking to Ontoh, not sure of ordering]

"What do you think happens if you bring a time machine back in time with you?"

[Uhhhh, do you destroy the fabric of space-time?]

Ethel had the answer to this one. [Her clear voice, immediately making sense of things and dispelling the fog] "[there's no way to physically distinguish whether you're in the interior of an argonian bubble.] So from the perspective of anyone who stays inside the bubble, it would have to behave exactly as you would expect for any other time machine. If you activated the inner time machine, you would 'go back' relative to <em>the time that the inner time machine experienced</em>, thus returning to what we'd call 'the future' from an outside perspective."
