????? We owe it to Aster to let them use the antidote

[reg being different than Aster - deeper, gravelly voice, look of fear - in all the time we'd known Aster, we'd never seen them afraid, not even when the gun was being pointed at them. but Reginald was deeply afraid]

"I'm dissociating, you need to take me back to my office –"

"I'm sorry. We can't let you leave until we've explained what's going on"

?????

[Reginald feeling utterly betrayed by Aster; as a grave whisper, "God damn it, Aster, what have you done?"; K+M offer excuses and Reginald argues against them; at some point, "'Reggie' is only a name for my intimates, I can't believe Aster gave it out to everyone"]

[With deeply aggrieved conviction] "If I get any say in this at all, we are going to have some god damn <em>ethics</em> around here."

[Chapter break, "the ethics board"]


[Reginald saying how everything up to this point has been an utter mess ethics wise, including some harsh words for Marvin's choices ("profoundly amoral act"/I hung my head/"at least you have the decency to be ashamed") and saying Kayla was "excused but not justified" (there is a difference between a justification and an excuse! We can excuse Kayla's [brutal murder of a man who had already surrendered] because [of her natural, extreme feelings about the situation he had put her in], but I will not sit here and allow you to justify it. More specifics, not sure of relative order:]

"[Marvin spied on innocent people.] Some of whom were children, I might add –"

[Need to fit in around here: discussion of Marvin delaying several days before doing anything about it even once he knew about the children,. "I was going to report it," I said, but I knew I wasn't sure if I really would have.]

[Kayla defensive of Marvin's spying because it led to her rescue]

"Did he know that?" Reginald demanded. ????? "[Did he know they were evil when he started]"

[Kayla defensive some more – "of course he knew they were evil! They put surveillance cameras all over the place, they turned this building into the goddamn Panopticon! Even if they hadn't [done monk consensual experiments] they would still be evil –"]

But I knew that Reginald was right. [I hadn't thought about it at all – I was just lucky] I hung my head.

"At least you have the decency to be ashamed," said Reginald brusquely.






"Are you vegan?" Kayla cut in.

"I happen to enjoy a good steak on occasion," said Reginald [physicality: "Reginald sniffed", haughty-ish, sarcastic excuse-me tone].

Kayla [settled a little, not trying to press the issue but not feeling like Reginald's judgment was as much of a threat]

Reginald [understood the implication; implicitly, he recognized it as a threat to him being taken seriously]. "Are you going to [say I'm evil because I'm not vegan?]" [With a incredulous tone – a couple degrees less severe than "voice dripping with skepticism"]

Kayla shrugged. "Your lifestyle requires the murder of sapient beings," she said. Her tone wasn't accusatory – it was the tone of someone who is discussing the plain facts. "[You have no more right to judge than any of us]"

Reginald [got back on top of things]. "Even if I take that to be true, it only illustrates my point. If none of us are morally pure, then that is why we cannot simply defer to any one person's judgment, but must actively [work together to be rigorously protected against our individual flaws]"





If you were involved with the University of all, it was hard not to know about Dr. Ethel Wright.

One of the University's most respected and prolific physicists, she had authored and co-authored hundreds of papers in her long career. She was one of those people who simply never stops: Even in her old age, she was constantly moving on to the next project, the next ?????. She was old enough to have been the first woman on the physics faculty, and then later, the first woman head-of-department, a position she still held thirty years later.

I sat down with her in her office [physical description; she had arrived several hours before the 4 PM meeting, so we had time; she didn't know I was there to judge her]

"I'm a writer," I lied blandly. [I told her that Dr. Fuller had hired me, to prepare to have a favorable story to release to the public if we ever ended up in the public eye, and so now I was going around and talking to all of the scientists to have good background material]

[She was a little surprised, but not unfavorable to the idea. I started with easy questions, learning a long story of interesting details about her history with the University]


[An experiment involving an iron vessel, but the results were very confusing, and she kept forgetting to follow up on it]

"At that time I had a great deal of worry, as you can imagine, that age was catching up with me. [I have always defined my personal value based on the abilities of my mind, so losing that is like losing myself]. [But I thought about it in an analytical way, and it was conspicuous that the problem only appeared on this specific project – for reasons I'm sure you are aware of]"

?????

And then I came to the [big question that was the biggest purpose of this talk]. Keeping my voice casual, I continued, "how do you feel about the children?"

[Instantly icy] "Dr. Fuller didn't send you," she said [crisply? no, feeling-threatened-ly? no, more restrained than either].

?????

[She tries to call Doctor Fuller, the phone rings and rings – or is Marvin carrying the phone right now?] "

[Marvin didn't expect to be angry, but seeing that Dr. Wright knew about the children and tried to cover it up makes him start saying things in a somewhat angry way]

?????

She bowed her head. "Is this my judgment, then?"

"I am not God," I said, a bit reproachfully.










[Ethics board in session – everyone is here]



[Also, is going back in time murder? Kayla says we SHOULD consider the idea that we are murdering and/or torturing billions of people by going back in time even once. So they have to talk about the basis of their moral system. Maybe Reginald says "when I said ethics, I didn't necessarily mean we needed to go deep into moral philosophy"/?????/"I guess maybe we do need to go deep into moral philosophy… I suppose we are not short of [he said the word with absolute disdain] <em>time</em> for such a discussion"… So what is the fundamental basis of morality?. Someone says that suffering is bad and satisfaction is good, and it's the total amount of suffering and satisfaction that makes the world good and bad. How do you tell whether to Something is murder? Well, the reason murder is bad is because it causes people to suffer]

"But then destroying the entire universe would be a morally neutral act" [because no one suffers afterwards]

"Yes. Destroying the entire universe is a morally neutral act."

[Ethics of going back in time and repeating someone's suffering – does the suffering count twice, or once, or zero times? Ontoh says it only counts if it isn't reverted]

[Something like [I feel like I've forgotten the proper way to state this though]: Moral statements generally runs from someone considering two possible ways things could go and decide that they like one of them better than the other, yes? But if you destroy the entire universe, there is no one who can make that comparison]



[Ethics of reengineering the phrenochondria to make people stop abusing each other; ethics of removing them (removing them is nonconsensual mind control, but leaving them in is also nonconsensual mind control)]



[maybe somewhere while discussing the "morality of a god" thing – "then we are a necessary evil"

"Believing yourself to be a good person, and believing yourself to be an evil person, are both just ways of avoiding responsibility for your choices. [What's important is the process of looking for the best option available, and when you tell yourself a just-so story about what kind of a moral agent you are, you settle into a habit of not evaluating the options]"
