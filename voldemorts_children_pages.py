<p>I've been planning <i>Voldemort's Children</i> since September of last year, when I started analyzing the original series from a neurodiversity perspective. <i>Voldemort's Children</i> is an "Alternate Universe" fanfic - a reimagining of the story in which I explore one possibility of how events could happen in a world where we don't gloss over the implications of neurological difference in general and Harry's abuse as a child in particular.</p>

<p>I'm going to leave it at that for the moment, but I'll sometimes use these annotations to talk more about the purpose and structure of the story.</p>

<p>I've chosen to represent it with a jagged, irregular writing style.</p>

<p>On this page, I've also chosen to misspell the words Harry speaks. Imagine if I did that on every page.

<p>However, it would also make the comic harder to read. Ultimately, I decided that it wouldn't be worth the cost. As an author, I want my work to be as easy to read as possible.

    "annotation": '''<p>Ah, the Time-Twister.</p>
    
<p>In the original series, there is a device called a <q>Time-Turner</q> that can magically transport you back in time by one hour. That has huge implications about the nature of the universe, and it's abundantly unclear what its limitations are; the original series just glosses over them. But logically, you'd expect them to be a huge issue &ndash; the Aurors would all have them, Voldemort would probably have one, and every important battle would be based on tricky uses of time travel.</p>

<p>So I had three choices: I could justify Time-Turners, I could eliminate them entirely, or I could change them into something else. <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/main/posts/38-recommended-website-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality"><i>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</i></a> takes the first option; it creates a consistent set of rules for how Time-Turners work and how they handle temporal paradoxes. I didn't want to do that, because this isn't a story about time shenanigans; it's more of a story about characters and their emotional interactions. So it was between eliminating Time-Turners and changing them.</p>

<p>I didn't want to eliminate them because I <em>really really liked</em> the symbolism of Hermione using the Time-Turner to take extra classes &ndash; it shows a lot about how dedicated someone is when ze's willing to warp the very fabric of time in order to pursue zir goals. So I left the object in, but changed it. The Time-Twister doesn't send you back in time by an hour... it just gives you an extra hour, somehow, and no one's exactly sure how it works. You can use it go to two classes that are at the same time, but if you do, you won't remember which order you went to them in, and if someone follows you around, they'll come to both classes with you &ndash; so the Time-Twister doesn't just affect you, it affects everyone around you.</p>

<p>The other reason I made Time-Twisters is because some parts of my plot are anachronistic to the canon timeline, and I didn't want to bother restructuring the timeline to work out &ndash; instead I just handwave it by saying everything happens at the right time due to the damage done by Voldemort's Time-Twister overuse.</p>

<p>I'm explaining this all in an annotation because the details of how Time-Twisters work aren't actually very important. (If something is important, I explain it on an actual page.)</p>''',
