A metaphorical image: Across the top are Granger, Voldemort, and Dumbledore; Voldemort looks straight ahead, while Granger and Dumbledore face away, towards the side of the page, looking concerned, pointing their fingers as if to illustrate a point in an argument. Dumbledore's right hand is black and shriveled. In the middle of the page is a child, the young Tom Riddle: Ze looks very much like Voldemort except that ze's smiling instead of having a flat expression, zir face is hidden by a baseball cap instead of by darkness, and ze's wearing a colorful shirt and pants instead of a dark robe. To the right of Riddle is a younger version of Dumbledore, who has a less-wrinkled face and brown hair and beard instead of grey, but still wears the purple robes and glasses of zir present self; to the left is a two-story brick building with gables and windows, some of which are lit.<br/>

Granger flies up the staircase and Disapparates in midair, then reappears high above Hogwarts Castle. Then ze flies down to the wall of Dumbledore's office, causes the stone blocks to move aside by magic, and steps in. Dumbledore has new furniture, which is dark grey, and zir right hand is blackened.

  "annotation":"""<p>In the books, Dumbledore uses mind magic to make Mrs Cole stop asking questions about Hogwarts. I didn't want to do that here, because my Dumbledore is someone who's "well-intentioned" and genuinely cares about other people, even though ze does things that are harmful. Ze isn't supposed to disregard the lives of others for zir own convenience. (Isn't that ironic &ndash; I have to make Dumbledore <em>nicer</em> for this story.)</p>

<p>To justify the change, one could argue that it's not the most practical way to hide the existence of magic. I could imagine something like this happening: After Dumbledore leaves, some of Mrs Cole's friends ask zem about Riddle, and ze says that Tom is going to a school called Hogwarts. They try to look up Hogwarts, and it doesn't exist, so they tell Mrs Cole about it. Their only explanation is that Dumbledore must be a fraudster trying to steal children. Mrs Cole gets upset and goes to the local newspaper, who (since wizards can't infiltrate <em>every</em> newspaper in Britain) prints a story about it. By the time the magical world hears about it, there's an entire town full of people who will mistrust anything by the name "Hogwarts". That would be inconvenient.</p>

<p>So, instead, I think it works like this: non-magical people are encouraged to know that "Hogwarts" exists and is a very exclusive boarding school. For people like Tom, Hogwarts representatives contact their guardians years earlier (under various pretenses) so that it isn't a surprise when someone comes to take the child away to school.</p>""",

<p>In the books, the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy presumably has an exception for the immediate families of Muggle-born wizards. The families of Muggle-borns we meet in the books (Hermione, Lily) know plenty of stuff about magic. But outside of that, there's nothing. Worse, it's not common practice to tell Muggle-borns about their abilities before the year they enter Hogwarts. (And not from lack of ability to identify them earlier. All magical children are detected at birth.)</p>

<p>I'd be very surprised if there isn't a large achievement gap between Muggle-born and wizard-born students at Hogwarts and other schools. Muggle-borns are, at age 11, shoved into a new world they know nothing about, and to make it worse, they're not allowed to talk about it even with their closest friends.</p>

<p>Thus, even though the Statute doesn't have an explicit blood-purist ideology written into it, it's still designed from such a magical-world-centric point of view that it hurts the very people who are already hurt the most by prejudice and discrimination.</p>

<p>Does this remind you of anything from real life? Please answer in the comments!</p>

<p>Still, Voldemort kills a lot of people <em>personally</em>, and even in the books, being a Death Eater is a significant risk factor for being killed by Voldemort. Voldemort kills about twenty named characters, and at least two of them (Peter Pettigrew and Severus Snape) were Death Eaters. The vast majority of characters aren't Death Eaters.

The next thing we see is Granger in the Strategy Room at the Auror Offices, addressing the Aurors. Ze is carrying the parchment Dumbledore signed, and others, in zir left hand; in zir right, ze is pointing zir wand to levitate a Muggle water dispenser.<br/>
GRANGER: Aurors! I have brought you here for the second time today to discuss our new situation in relation to Luna Lovegood. I have, in my hand, the signatures of the Minister and entire Wizengamot to the effect that she is to be killed on sight. You may ask yourselves if this is the right thing; perhaps it is not, but as in any situation, by the time our Office becomes involved, the moment is long past when whatever happens will be the right thing. All that we can do is minimise the damage that occurs afterwards. You must prepare yourselves to be able to kill without hesitation. {pause} However... {pause} It would not do for a member of our Office to execute a mere prankster or hostage who has been disguised as Lovegood. To address this, the goblins of Gringotts have generously supplied me with a small amount of water from the Thief's Downfall, which cancels any magical concealment or enchantment. You will each be given enough to spray a person a few times. {pause} You must only use this water on a person you believe might be Lovegood, for three reasons: One, our supply is limited; two, it can be fatal to people who rely upon life-sustaining enchantments; three, I have promised the goblins that you will not, and cooperative wizard-goblin relations are more important than our lives. {pause} Shacklebolt, I believe you are familiar with this Muggle convenience; I didn't trust a magical keg to seal well after being disenchanted. I leave you in charge of its efficient usage. {pause} Tonks, if I may impose on your time for a final time today...""",

<p>Why did the goblins do anything to help Granger? I think the most likely explanation is this: Granger has proven zemself an ally to the goblins, <em>and</em> ze paid them well for the Thief's Downfall water. Granger understands that for the goblins to sell the water at all, even for a high price, is a generous act rather than a stingy one. The goblins don't like participating in conflicts between one wizard and another. (Hence, also, why they demanded the promise that it would only be used for this specific purpose &ndash; a purpose which is not intrigue-filled and is potentially life-saving.)</p>""",
