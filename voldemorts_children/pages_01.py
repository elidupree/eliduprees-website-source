<p>In the original series, there is a device called a <q>Time-Turner</q> that can magically transport you back in time by one hour. That has huge implications about the nature of the universe, and the books never specify its limitations. Logically, you'd expect them to be a huge issue &ndash; the Aurors would all have them, Voldemort would probably have one, and every important battle would be based on tricky uses of time travel.</p>

<p>I had three choices: I could justify Time-Turners, I could eliminate them entirely, or I could change them into something else. <a href="/blog/recommended-website-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality"><span class="title">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</span></a> takes the first option; it creates a (supposedly) consistent set of rules for how Time-Turners work and how they handle temporal paradoxes. I didn't want to do that, because this isn't a story about time shenanigans. It's more of a story about characters and their emotional interactions. So it was between eliminating Time-Turners and changing them.</p>

<p>I didn't want to eliminate them because I <em>really really liked</em> the symbolism of Hermione using the Time-Turner to take extra classes. Ze warped the very fabric of time in order to study harder &ndash; that's some serious dedication. So I kept the object, but changed it. The Time-Twister doesn't send you back in time by an hour... it just gives you an extra hour, somehow, and no one's exactly sure how it works. You can use it go to two classes that are at the same time, but if you do, you won't remember which order you went to them in, and if someone follows you around, they'll come to both classes with you &ndash; so the Time-Twister doesn't just affect you, it affects everyone around you.</p>

<p>(Another reason I made Time-Twisters work this way is that it means I don't have to worry too much about keeping a consistent timeline. If things seem inconsistent or anachronistic, they are! It's canon!)</p>''',

<p>You'd have to be a real <i>Harry Potter</i> scholar to remember what those spells do, but I've written their effects down in the transcript.</p>

<p>Transcripts help make the story accessible to as many people as possible. This is obviously useful for people who are vision-impaired and can't see the image at all, or people who can see the image but can't read the text in it. But that's not the only group who can benefit from transcripts. They are also helpful to people who have trouble interpreting the <strong>language of comics</strong> that I'm using &ndash; e.g. which things happen in which timeframe, what is dialogue and what is thoughts, and so forth. You could have trouble because you're unfamilar with the medium, or because of cognitive differences, or because I drew things in a confusing way (which I can't deny will happen sometimes).</p>

<p>Because the transcript has many different possible uses, I try to make it explain <em>all</em> the relevant information from the image. A lot of websites have transcripts that repeat the words drawn in the image, but don't describe the pictures. I believe that it's important to include both.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a work of fan fiction, it has a lot of implicit references to things from the <i>Harry Potter</i> universe. I can't reasonably explain all of them. I will generally try to explain things in the transcript if they're obscure enough that a fair chunk of <i>Harry Potter</i> readers won't know them. This includes information from the later books in the series, because I've met a bunch of people who have read the first book, or the first few books, but not all of them. I'm not trying to make the story <em>entirely</em> accessible to people who haven't read <i>Harry Potter</i> at all, but I want it to be as accessible as I can reasonably make it.

First, it might make it seem like the problems actually <em>aren't</em> that bad, when they would be for many people. Second, it might send the message that the proper solution to being mistreated is to just ignore it. And it also means that, while the words of Granger and Harry sometimes voice my own opinions about what is injust, I cannot use Luna in the same way.</p>

  "annotation":"""<p> "Fatso", you ask? Why is Harry fat?</p>
  
<p>The Dursleys routinely forced Harry to go without food as a punishment. As a result, Harry's body adapted by storing extra fat whenever possible, to save up for times when there was no food.</p>

<p>Then, at Hogwarts, Harry was allowed to eat all the food ze could possibly want. This is a good thing: People need to eat a lot of food to recover from malnutrition. Typically, they gain a lot of weight at first, then eventually settle back to something like their natural weight, whatever that is for the individual.</p>

<p> Judging by the books, Harry is naturally skinny, so it's a little unusual that my Harry is still fat years later, in the present. However, periods of starvation can also have a permanent effect on people's metabolism, and chronic stress can cause significant weight gain as well.</p>

<p>Crabbe is obviously just being mean. But other people who might harass Harry for being fat might think that they are encouraging Harry to eat healthier. Those people are both cruel and incorrect: Harry isn't unhealthy because ze's fat &ndash; ze is fat because ze's unhealthy. Eating less would make zem even more unhealthy.</p>

  "transcript":"""Snape kneels over the unconscious Goyle, while Harry, Crabbe, and Draco stand still at the top of the stairs.<br/>
SNAPE: Vulnera indico. { A non-canon spell; Latin for "Reveal the injuries". }<br/>
Magical energy appears on Goyle's body on the head, one arm, and one leg, as well as near Snape's wand.<br/>
SNAPE: He will recover... with time...<br/>
Snape turns to look up the stairs.<br/>
SNAPE: Potter! Return to your dormitory immediately. I will know if you do not. The Headmaster will see you as soon as he is available. Malfoy, Crabbe, come with me. It goes without saying that both your houses will be penalized for this incident.<br/>
We see Harry climbing through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room. This is one of the most well-lit rooms we've seen yet, although it is still shadowy. A fire burns in a hearth. There are two round tables with plush chairs around them, and a couch of a similar style across from the portrait hole. At one of the tables, Granger is breezing through a Transfiguration assignment involving turning glass marbles into beetles and writing about it (although it's probably too small for the average viewer to see that's exactly what's going on). Granger is facing away from Harry; at the other table, George Weasley and Angelina Johnson are standing and facing Harry angrily as ze enters the room. George is very pale and has short-cropped red hair; Angelina is quite dark and has more-than-shoulder-length black hair.<br/>
ANGELINA: Well, if it isn't the prat who just lost us fifty points!""",
  "annotation":"""<p>That's Angelina Johnson, by the way (and George Weasley near zem). I originally had planned to make the two jerks here be Fred and George, but then I remembered how much Angelina had badgered Harry in the fifth book about getting in trouble by standing up to Umbridge, so I figured ze'd be perfect for this role.</p>

<p>I'm slightly concerned that none of my darker-skinned characters so far have been friendly ones. Lily Evans will be dark-skinned and friendly, though, or at least as friendly as you can get in a story as <em>metaphorically</em> dark as this one. (I don't know if Angelina's race is ever specificed in the books, but ze's black in the movies, and I consider the movies to be canon when they don't contradict the books &ndash; and I saw no particular reason to change it, since whitewashing my characters would be a jerk move too.)</p>

<p>On another note, I'd ask, "Do you think Snape is doing the right thing in this situation?", but I think it's the wrong question. How about: Are Snape's actions here <em>sufficient</em> to address the wrongs we've seen? And what kinds of things could Snape have done earlier, to stop this situation from having happened in the first place?</p>""",
