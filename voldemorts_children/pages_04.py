Luna and Harry are now wearing red robes like the ones Lily was wearing when Voldemort attacked, and this version of Harry speaks in the pure red of present Harry. Draco is still wearing grey student robes, but zir collar is now red instead of green. Draco's face has two new scars on it that we haven't seen before; one is at the left corner of zir mouth where Harry kicked zem (the same place as Harry's mouth scar, but a different shape), and the other is next to zir right eye.<br/>

PAST HARRY: Of course we can, th&ndash;<br/>
DRACO: They won't come.<br/>
LUNA: No, Draco, let me be the one to tell him about the elves!<br/>
A narrative frame opens in which Luna describes the founding of Hogwarts.<br/>
LUNA: The history books make a big deal about the conflict over admitting muggle-borns...<br/>
The four founders (Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Salazar Slytherin, and Helga Hufflepuff) stand at the corners of a metaphorical four-sided shape. Gryffindor is bearded, wears pants and boots, and has a sword. Ravenclaw has long purple hair and a smooth appearance, with zir hair and robes trailing as if they're in the wind, but in opposite directions. Slytherin has zir arms folded, wears dark robes, and has grey hair and a thin grey beard. Hufflepuff is short and plump, and wears earthy colors. Where they're standing, Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are close to each other, as are Ravenclaw and Slytherin, but the pairs (Gryffindor-Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw-Slytherin) are farther apart from each other.<br/>
SLYTHERIN: Muggles are an inferior race!<br/>
GRYFFINDOR: Yeah, but Muggle-borns are still wizards!<br/>
RAVENCLAW: They simply are not equipped to study here.<br/>
HUFFLEPUFF: What? They'll work as hard as anyone else.<br/>
LUNA: But they { the history books } only make a footnote of Helga Hufflepuff's belief that students, not enslaved elves, should do the daily work of the castle.<br/>
The four founders are now arranged with Hufflepuff far away from the others, who are all close together. The other three are facing away from Hufflepuff.<br/>
HUFFLEPUFF: It will teach them humility and citizenship.<br/>
GRYFFINDOR, RAVENCLAW, AND SLYTHERIN: There's no excuse to waste the time of witches and wizards!<br/>
Luna's narrative frame closes; we are back in the tent.<br/>
LUNA: Today, the house-elves do not serve the Hufflepuff dormitory. The laundry is done by students... the beds are made by s&ndash;<br/>
PAST HARRY: Then Hufflepuff is the only house worth being Sorted into!<br/>
A pause.<br/>
DRACO: Um... Are either of you&ndash;<br/>
Harry and Luna look down. { Harry is in Gryffindor, Luna is in Ravenclaw, and Draco is in Slytherin. }""",
  "annotation":"""<p>Harry is essentially saying that if a group passively supports a horrific institution like slavery, then you should completely reject that group, regardless of any other virtues it may have. Do you agree?</p>

<p>The Hufflepuff students, by the way, still do eat elf-cooked food in the Great Hall with the others.</p>

<p>The tent where Harry, Draco, and Luna are meeting is in a hidden location, much like in the seventh book when the trio are on the run from Voldemort. This is also the same location where they listen to the radio all the way back on <a href="/main/posts/163-voldemort's-children-page-4">page 4</a>; maybe I'll retcon a tent onto that page eventually, to make it more clear.</p>

<p>On a more technical note... Until (and including) this page, I've hand-lettered all the dialogue in <i>Voldemort's Children</i>. That's been okay so far, even in chapter four (I was taking 1-2 hours for each page just drawing Granger's dialogue, but that was reasonable because Granger was talking a lot). The trouble is, Luna's speech takes a <em>long time</em> to draw &ndash; I spent an entire two hours just drawing zir dialogue on this page, out of six hours total to draw the page. That's not really worth it. So I've created a TrueType font for Luna, and I'm going to start using that on tomorrow's page. It won't look quite as nice, because it won't have all the friendly irregularities of the hand-drawn dialogue, but it's still generally the same.</p>

<p>If I decide I like the choice, I'll probably do the same thing for Granger next time ze talks a lot, because Granger is very verbose and zir speech is already pretty standardized.</p>""",

  "annotation":"""<p>The house-elves will not appear again. I just wanted to remind you that the entire society of the <i>Harry Potter</i> universe is based on slavery.</p>

<p>In the bubble at the top, I knew I wanted the elves' training to be overseen by one of the three founders (other than Hufflepuff), but it took me a while to decide who it should be. I sketched in Slytherin at first, but ze seemed too obvious &ndash; and I'd expect the actual Salazar Slytherin to be more of a "hands-off" person who wants to profit from this dirty business but not actually be involved in it. Between Ravenclaw and Gryffindor, I settled on Gryffindor for two reasons:</p>

<ol><li>I wanted to play up the "Gryffindor may seem like a good guy, but ze's not" statement from the previous page.</li><li>With the sword and the boots, I'm going for a fighter/conquerer image, and that fits perfectly with the subjugation of another race.</li></ol>

<p>That said, there was also a point in Ravenclaw's favor: It would enhance the "They thought about the elves' lives purely as a logistical problem" angle.<p>

<p>As a side note, I've recently learned that in J.K. Rowling's vision, Helga Hufflepuff <em>brought</em> the elves to Hogwarts. In that version, ze did it because no one would be cruel to them in the Hogwarts kitchens, which was the best ze could achieve in an era of history when nobody would accept actually freeing them. I think there's some merit to that version of the story, but it fits much too easily into the books' narrative of Harry's and Hermione's interactions with the elves (especially Kreacher), where the moral of the story seems to be "It's okay to have slaves, but you should treat your slaves nicely".</p>""",

  "annotation":"""<p>In the books, the Headmaster's office can seal itself against powerful wizards who try to intrude, so it would be strange if ordinary fire could get through the door.</p>

<p>I think the door in the <em>dungeons</em> is an ordinary door made of stone. If the Fiendfyre can burn through the door, does that mean it also burns all the walls? That could cause major structual damage to the castle! I can see a few different ways it could work:</p>
<ul><li>It's like gas pressure and looks for the easiest way to expand &ndash; it'll only burn rock until it breaks through into another open space.</li><li>It can't burn the door, but it can push through the cracks around the door until there's enough on the other side.</li><li>It doesn't have the power to burn very much rock, but it's intelligent or semi-intelligent and likes killing people and/or destroying valuable objects, so it attacks the door on purpose in order to get to them.</li></ul>

<p>Also, what can actually stop Fiendfyre from expanding? In the books, they escape by exiting a magical room that's different every time you enter it; what if you cast Fiendfyre outdoors? Here are a few of the many possibilities:</p>
<ul><li>It would actually burn the whole world, but only a few people have the skill and interest to learn to cast it, and none of those people have ever been stupid/omnicidal enough to try it.</li>
<li>It would burn the whole world, except that a lot of people know how to put it out by magic, and it doesn't become much harder to stop just because it expands wildly.</li>
<li>It doesn't actually gain power from expanding or burning things, and only expands until it runs out of the energy given to it by the person who cast it.</li></ul>

<p>I think my favorite interpretation is that it's intelligent and can only expand by consuming magic, which it can get by burning magical objects or killing magical people. On the other hand, it can keep burning for a long time by just sitting in the same place, so if you seal it in, it's only safe until the seal is broken again.</p>

<p>In this particular situation, how they deal with it afterwards isn't important enough to make it onto a page, but it's easy to explain here. Snape knows about Fiendfyre because ze's studied the "Dark Arts" extensively. Snape is also sensible/cowardly enough (take your pick) that ze doesn't try to go extinguish it zemself, but blocks it, evacuates the students, and alerts the Ministry. At that point, Granger (who knows about Fiendfyre because ze's studied <em>everything</em> extensively) arrives and extinguishes it, possibly with some help from Snape or the other professors. Normally, Dumbledore would be able to do that, but Dumbledore isn't exactly in a position to do so right now.</p>

<p>Also, I decided that there's an old wizarding law that says a person who casts Fiendfyre and lets it run wild must pay a penalty of fifty Galleons to the person who extinguishes it. So, in the present, Granger now knows that Zabini's family owes zem fifty Galleons. Ze hardly plans to collect.</p>""",

Draco starts crying. Harry hugs Draco, who continues crying in zir arms.<br/>
DRACO: And I can't go back... they'll know it was me...<br/>
LUNA: Um, probably, they'll think you're dead with the others. But yeah, no going back.<br/>
At some later time, Draco sends a message by owl to Lucius Malfoy, saying "I am alive. Tell no one."<br/>
The narrative frame of present Harry describing the past closes. Percy Weasley pokes zir head in the door.<br/>
PERCY {quietly}: Phew! What a lot of stairs!<br/>
PERCY: Granger, the responses are as you expected.<br/>
GRANGER: Then it appears that, for now, our time here is at an end.

<p>Those are the actual Granger and Gryffindor fonts at the end; I finished them earlier today. Since I started making the fonts, this is the first page without <em>any</em> hand-drawn letters.</p>

<p>How have the trio been sending owls to people when they're on the run from the law? There's a bunch of possibilities; I like these two the best:</p>
<ul><li>They go in disguise and rent owls from owl-rental places.</li><li>They have sympathizers who know where they are and send them messages by owl sometimes; they use those owls to send messages later.</li></ul>""",
