An image of a set of scales. On the right side, there is a small version of Granger standing, being weighed. The left side of the scales is filled with small versions of other characters: Voldemort, Dumbledore, McGonagall, the Dursleys, Zabini, Crabbe, and Goyle. A hand reaches from above and pushes down Granger's side, so it appears that Granger is weighed heavier than all the others put together.<br/>
At the bottom is the chapter title:<br/>
The Harshest Judge""",

<p>This will be a chapter about Granger!</p>

<p>The illustration was inspired by the Ancient Egyptian myth that, in the afterlife, your heart/soul is weighed against a feather. If it's heavier (meaning more evil) than the feather, then it will be devoured by a monster.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I've known what this image will be for a long time. For the earlier chapters, I've invented most of the title-page visual metaphors on the same days I drew them, but for this one and the next one, I've known since before I drew the first page.</p>""",

Granger and Tonks are standing in front of the window to Harry's cell, once again questioning zem. In the cell, Harry has an image of Voldemort (still with zir face visible) standing over zem. Voldemort is covering Harry's mouth. They speak in unison as they did on <a href="/main/posts/168-voldemort's-children-page-9">[TW: physical bullying] page 9</a>.<br/>
HARRY AND VOLDEMORT: No. Enough. I've told you far too much already.<br/>
GRANGER: You are not worried that no one will know your story?<br/>
HARRY AND VOLDEMORT: It's better if they don't. There's no reason for me to afflict even one more person with what I know.<br/>
GRANGER: Then perhaps I will, instead, tell you <em>my</em> story.<br/>
TONKS {whispering to Granger}: Granger, what are you doing?<br/>
GRANGER {whispering back}: Harry is strongly affected by even the simplest shows of respect. If I open up to him, he will feel obligated to open up to me. Seal the room so that we can't be overheard; I trust you, but not everyone should know what I will say now.""",

  "transcript":"""GRANGER: For me, it all begins with a troll. Months before, I had been an unnoted Muggle child; we have traced my ancestry back four generations, but there are no traces of magic in them.<br/>
We enter a narrative frame in which Granger describes past events. Things drawn in Granger's narration don't fade off into darkness at the edges; they are drawn in rectangular panels with black outside, but light everywhere inside.<br/>
We see an abstract family tree, with all of Granger's ancestors up to zir great-grandparents. Granger's parents are both wearing lab coats, as is one of zir grandparents. Another grandparent carries a pitchfork. Most of the people in the tree are light-skinned, like Granger, but one great-grandparent is quite dark-skinned, and ze's paired with a person dressed in a uniform like that of a military officer. Beyond the great-grandparents, there are only question marks.<br/>
PRESENT GRANGER: I had had many advantages: Good health... this intelligence that I have been told is extraordinary... My parents are medical professionals, and they gave me the best education up to age eleven that the Muggle world has to offer. But the moment that I feel sets me apart is the moment of my first Halloween at Hogwarts.<br/>
We see a troll &ndash; a large, blocky green humanoid &ndash; dragging a club and punching through a door. Next to the door is a sign indicating that this is a bathroom intended for female people.<br/>
PRESENT GRANGER: Later, I learned that Professor Quirrel had starved the troll to the point of desperation &ndash; Trolls are not naturally violent towards humans &ndash; and set it on the castle as a distraction while he attempted to steal the Philosopher's Stone. At the end of the year, Quirrel was caught and dismissed from professorship, and I received a Special Award for Services to the School, when I rescued him from the Devil's Snare during another botched theft attempt. {pause} But for the moment, knowing none of this, I was just a lone child facing against a creature much, much larger than myself...""",
  "annotation":"""<p>Sexist tropes used in the <i>Harry Potter</i> books: "The main female character will be <em>attacked by a monster</em>, while ze's <em>in a bathroom</em>, and ze will <em>need the male main characters to save zem</em> (despite the fact that ze's generally much more competent than they are)."</p>

<p>Before I started writing <i>Voldemort's Children</i>, I didn't think of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series as being particularly sexist. But now that I've started scrutinizing it more deeply (as I have to, in order to write a good fanfic), I've started seeing the sexism everywhere.</p>

<p>On a mostly-unrelated note, in real life, there basically aren't any creatures that intentionally walk around attacking other creatures, except for predators attacking prey. Wild animals often attack humans or other animals that intrude on their territory or come near their offspring, but alone in an unfamiliar place, it's rather strange that this troll would attack humans on sight. An animal that is large, slow, and stupid would not make a good predator; I'm guessing that trolls are omnivorous, something like bears.</p>

<p>The other possibility, I suppose, is that trolls were originally created by magic, and were specifically designed to be violent. I think the "trolls aren't monsters, just wild animals" interpretation is nicer, though.</p>""",

We see a view of Granger sitting in the Gryffindor common room, reading the Daily Prophet newspaper. The headline is "Hogwarts student uncovers Pettigrew", and it has a picture of Granger on the front cover.<br/>
DAILY PROPHET: Granger takes it all with perfect modesty. "All it took was one person to be suspicious of their neighbor's rat", she said in an interview. "And really, I wouldn't have noticed anything if it wasn't for Crookshanks. She deserves as much credit as I do." {paragraph break} Student response to the news that a Dark Wizard was living among them is mixed. "I know I'm going to take Defense Against the Dark Arts more seriously after this," Ron Weasley said, speaking for the majority. But not all students are surprised.

"Mostly stalkers and overprotective parents, so a fugitive is nice for variety!"<br/>

Ze is always in control of the situation (with the small exception of when ze's around Voldemort or Snape, who are better at controlling situations than ze is). Ze lectures Harry on how to use the Cruciatus Curse <em>in the middle of a battle</em>, ze declares zir loyalty to Voldemort <em>while being sentenced to life in Azkaban</em>, ze's second only to Voldemort in the number of named characters ze kills by sheer magical skill, and ze never passes up an opportunity to impose zir unforgiving, blood-purist ideology on other people.</p>

Ze just does whatever ze feels like, and ze always feels like causing havoc and destruction. There are a few elements of that in the books, but the films add a lot more that wasn't in the books at all, and reduce the other aspects of zir character.</p>

But I barely slept that night, hearing her toss and turn on the bed above mine. Intellectually, I was familiar with the psychological aftermath of the Torture Curse; Tonks was not the first of my new companions who had experienced it, and she would not be the last. I had studied both the Muggle and the magical interpretations of trauma. But I fell to wondering:<br/>

  "transcript":"""PAST GRANGER: Let's go somewhere where we can't be overheard.<br/>
Granger takes Moody's arm and Apparates to a sunlit location with a lake, some tall grass, and trees.<br/>
Moody's speech is drawn in a very rough style, and is much darker than Granger's.<br/>
MOODY: Where are we?<br/>
PAST GRANGER: The first thing I did after I learned to Apparate was to find and memorize eighteen remote locations to use as escape routes. Now that you've seen this one, I have seventeen left. I picked them using dice and a map of Britain, so there's no way for anyone else to guess where I would have picked.<br/>
MOODY: Useful. But what will you do if your enemy grabs you before you can Disapparate?<br/>
PAST GRANGER: I've equipped two locations with traps for anyone who follows me.<br/>
MOODY: So you could have taken me into a trap. Good. Right then. You had a favor to ask. One that requires a moderate level of security.<br/>
PAST GRANGER: I want you to use the Cruciatus Curse on me. If I'm going to face it, and my fellow Aurors are going to face it, I need to know what it's like to be hit by it.<br/>
PRESENT GRANGER: Or so I rationalized it to myself. What did I expect to accomplish? Would putting myself through this somehow change what had happened? Or was it simply the most convenient way to assuage a sense of suvivor's guilt? Do I know myself well enough to be sure?""",
  "annotation":"""<p>Granger may be second-guessing zemself here, but to Moody, that explanation seemed perfectly sensible and logical!</p>

<p>This was obviously before Granger <a href="http://www.elidupree.com/main/posts/224-voldemort's-children-page-52">instituted the policy about saying "Torture Curse" instead of "Cruciatus Curse."</a></p>

<p>Granger also has escape locations outside of Britain, but there's a limit to how far you can Apparate, so those locations are only relevant while Granger is travelling to other countries.</p>

<p>One thing that I left out of this page was to have Granger and Moody confirm each other's identities before leaving the Ministry. It would have added to the "Moody is totally serious about security, and so is Granger" thing, but I couldn't come up with a good way to do it. They could have security questions, but it's hard to come up with shared information that can't also be guessed by someone who's been planning to impersonate you, and the bigger threat is if the person is under the Imperius Curse (Can the curse force someone to give the proper answer to a question? I'd guess that it can). The real Granger can resist the Imperius Curse, but it wouldn't be Moody's style to trust in that.</p><p>The only clever solution I came up with was for the two parties to make an Unbreakable Vow that they would truthfully reveal their identity and whether they're acting of their own free will. However, if that style of thing worked, people could use Unbreakable Vows for all kinds of things, which would change a lot of stuff about society in unexpected ways. So I figure there must be some major additional restrictions on the Vow that make it undesirable for general use. (Also, it requires a third person.)</p>""",
