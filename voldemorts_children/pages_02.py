CHAPTER THREE<br/>
Seats of Influence<br/>
<br/>
The left half is a complicated metaphorical image. Albus Dumbledore is sitting in a plain chair; behind zem, Voldemort is standing, putting one hand on Dumbledore's shoulder. Dumbledore has a long gray/white beard and wears purple robes. Both of them have the top halves of their heads concealed in shadow, and Dumbledore has the same flat expression that Voldemort always has. Voldemort's wand, as we've seen before, is nearly white; Dumbledore's is nearly black. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort are pointing their wands downwards, working together to conjure an elliptical pool of magical energy, which is half Dumbledore's characteristic color and half Voldemort's. The pool is also divided into three parts by a spiral design, and the three sections are occupied by tiny versions of Harry, Draco, and Luna. Luna is sitting in a plain chair, looking serene; Harry is sitting in a very jagged chair that must be painful to sit in; Draco is lying on zir back next to a chair that has broken in half, and looks slightly panicked.""",

Harry walks into Dumbledore's office, but Dumbledore isn't there. Portraits of silhouetted people, presumably former Headmasters and Headmistresses, line the back wall. On one table are several delicate devices made of a bronze-ish metal. One is a set of scales with nothing in it; another has a roll of paper and is making a continuous mark on it, like certain types of seismograph. Another desk has a chair in front of it and a basin full of magic the color of Legilimency on it; this is the Pensieve. In the foreground, Fawkes the phoenix, a very brightly-colored magical bird, faces away from Harry and turns up its beak; Harry is looking unexcitedly towards the main desk.

  "annotation":""" <p>This page's dialogue is mostly from <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, pages 13-14.</p> <p>It's possible, at this point in history, that Dumbledore and McGonagall don't know the Dursleys' attitude towards magic. If they did, it's possible that they could rationalize it away by saying that the Dursleys will still treat Harry well because Harry is family to them. (Dumbledore would say "still love Harry" instead of "still treat Harry well", but there are plenty of people who love their children and still behave abusively towards them. Dumbledore thinks love is sufficient, but it isn't.)</p>

<p>Parents who send their teenage children to WWASP schools (TRIGGER WARNING for child abuse if you even do a web search for "WWASP") sometimes don't know about the abuses there, either. Does this mean Dumbledore is like those parents? (In short, WWASP is an organization that runs schools that keep teens in isolation and use extremely abusive "behavior modification" tactics, while denying everything and presenting a clean face as a program for "troubled teens". Tranquility Bay was a well-known one that got shut down, but there are many others, such as Cross Creek Programs and Horizon Academy.)</p>

<p>What about McGonagall, though? Ze resists the idea of placing Harry here for a moment. I could imagine zem as a person who's aware of the issue, but gives in because ze knows ze won't be able to argue Dumbledore out of it... But is it true?</p>

<p>In the movie, McGonagall describes the Dursleys as "the worst kind of Muggles". In the book, ze doesn't say that outright, but says "You couldn't find two people who are less like us" &ndash; and I infer that "us" means "wizards". Ze goes on, "These people will never understand him! He'll be famous!"... So it seems like zir objection is to a person of high status (a wizard, a child of a prestigious family, a legend) being placed with a family of low status (muggles, people with distasteful behavior by wizarding standards). McGonagall isn't thinking about child abuse here &ndash; ze opposes the placement because ze's <em>racist</em>.</p>""",

PRESENT HARRY: I saw lots of painful memories in the Pensieve, but that one hit me harder than any of the others.<br/>
In the memory, Hagrid arrives on an obviously magical motorcycle, carrying the infant Harry wrapped in blankets. Dumbledore and McGonagall are still standing in front of the Dursley home, waiting for zir arrival. Hagrid is huge; ze looks fully twice as tall as either of the others, although ze's also closer to the viewpoint, so the effect is somewhat more exaggerated than the reality.

HAGRID: House was almost destroyed, but I got him out alright before the muggles started swarming around.<br/>
PRESENT HARRY: It was Hagrid. The same person who rescued me ten years later...<br/>
Hagrid reaches out zir hand, offering the infant Harry to Dumbledore. Harry is barely wider than Hagrid's hand. Ze is sleeping, apparently peacefully, although there is a jagged cut on zir forehead, where the scar will be. A trickle of blood touches one of zir eyes. Ze doesn't have a scar at the corner of zir mouth; this is the first time we've seen Harry without that scar.<br/>

<p>On a more serious note, look at the way Hagrid refers to "muggles" as "swarming around" &ndash; I think it's rather dehumanizing. If I lived in this world, I'd probably be careful to use the phrase "non-magical people" instead, because "muggles" is used in a dehumanizing way so much.</p>

<p>I'd kind of like to have a different term to use in these annotations, too, because "witch/wizard" is gendered. (As a side note, I insist that in general usage, "wizard" is gender-neutral.

However, this is a <i>Harry Potter</i> fanfic, and in the <i>Harry Potter</i> universe, "wizard" is definitely gendered.)</p>""",

  "annotation":"""<p>How would this story flow differently if I had just written "So I ran to Hagrid's hut" instead of including this page?</p>

<p>For one thing, it would have been quicker and easier for me to write. That's one of my motivations, obviously. In fact, I want to get this story done as quickly as is possible without sacrificing quality, so if drawing something and just summarizing it are equally effective in the narrative, I'll go with the summary. If I draw something, it means that either it was quicker to draw it than to explain it (which sometimes happens), or it had an important effect that I couldn't achieve with a summary.</p>

<p>I can't actually be certain why I chose drawing instead of summary here. There are a few specific reasons I can think of, but I really made the decision based on instinct rather than logic.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first reason is that it establishes the setting &ndash; this way, you get a view of the outside of Hagrid's hut, and so you have more of a sense of where the action is than if you just saw the image of Harry inside the hut to begin with.</p>

<p>The second reason is that it dramatizes what's about to happen. What made Harry feel strongly enough that ze ran all the way to Hagrid's hut at a stretch? And what's going to happen when ze gets there? These are questions that you wouldn't have time to ponder if I skipped over the action of this page. (And we're going to be in Hagrid's hut for about three pages after this, so the hype is worth it &ndash; I wouldn't write a page-long setup to an event that was over in one page, unless it was REALLY important. But writing setup pages for sections that are larger or more important helps establish a structure for the story.)</p>""",

In the memory, a younger Snape, as a Hogwarts student, is lying on the grass near the lake, surrounded by three people who are taunting and laughing at zem: James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew. James Potter has light skin and light brown hair, and green eyes, like Harry's. Ze has a relatively smooth appearance. Ze's pointing a wand at Snape, and sitting in a chair. The speech of James and Sirius, who are both in Gryffindor, is similar to the Slytherin students' speech we've seen, but less curvy, more upright.<br/>

And if you were on the ground and he was in that chair, how would you like it if I stood here and said, "Go on, Serverus, keep hexing Potter &ndash; it's hilarious &ndash;"<br/>
We see an image illustrating the hypothetical situation Lily describes. The young Snape is sitting on the chair, pointing zir wand down at James, who is lying on the ground. Some other people stand around. Lily stands by the chair and smiles at Snape.<br/>

But <em>describing</em> the colors is a bit of a problem. For instance, I could describe the color of Voldemort's cat's eyes (when it was alive) as "orange", but there's a lot of different shades of orange; just saying "orange" doesn't specify that the eyes are exactly the same color as the Cruciatus Curse, which is symbolically semi-important. So I want a way to specify that, but how do I do it? I could refer to that color by the same phrase everywhere (e.g. "The orange of Voldemort's cat's eyes"), but that's very awkward and unnecessarily gives more weight to one specific use of the color. I could give its HTML code ("#ffc800"), which is exact, but that's obviously a bad idea. Any suggestions?</p>""",
