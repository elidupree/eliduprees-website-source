PAST GRANGER: Mr Crouch, if we use that name in the field, it is so similar to the incantation that it can cause false alarms or serve as a potent reminder of the trauma that civilians or other Aurors may have experienced. Surely you can understand the tactical significance.<br/>
PRESENT GRANGER: In private, we can say that it is a common trigger for posttraumatic stress disorder. Muggle science far outstrips our own in understanding the human mind. However, one would hardly appeal to the authority of a Muggle before Bartemius Crouch.<br/>
PAST GRANGER: As I was saying, it should be possible to set a trap for Potter.<br/>
Kingsley Shacklebolt replies. Ze has a friendly demeanor and zir speech is drawn in a somewhat curvy style.<br/>
SHACKLEBOLT: Very logical, but who in their right minds would play the bait?<br/>
PAST GRANGER: As a matter of fact...""",
  "annotation":"""<p>The Aurors under Granger, as a matter of policy and habit, don't say any word that contains the syllable "cru-". "crew" becomes "team", "crucial" becomes "essential", and so on. "Cruciatus Curse", of course, becomes "Torture Curse". They also refer to the Imperius Curse as the "Control Curse"; the PTSD issue is much less for that one, but the "false alarm" issue is especially relevant, since an indoors, apparently-friendly situation is the one in which you need to be the most vigilant against people <em>actually</em> casting the Imperius Curse.</p>

<p>From left to right: Arthur Weasley (Head of Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office), Pius Thicknesse, Bartemius Crouch, Amelia Bones (Head of <abbr title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement">DMLE</abbr> as a whole), Hermione Granger (Head of Auror Office), Kingsley Shacklebolt. In the books, it's not specified exactly what career path Crouch took to becoming the head of DMLE (while Voldemort was in power &ndash; ze was later demoted), but I decided it was natural that ze had been an Auror at some point along the way.</p>

<p>Arthur Weasley will wake up when they start talking about misuse of Muggle artefacts, which will probably be never.</p>

THICKNESSE: Oh, I think we <em>all</em> know Alecto Carrow.<br/>
PAST GRANGER: Excuse me?<br/>
CROUCH: Is Granger unaware of the number of reports we receive from that woman?<br/>
Inside a short narrative frame, we see Crouch's opinion of what Alecto Carrow does. One of Alecto's eyes is wide open, and the other is squinted; in general, ze's a caricature of a crazy person.

BONES: We will begin today's meeting with the Auror Office report. Granger?<br/>
GRANGER: Thank you, Madam Bones. I received John Dawlish's distress call at 21:40 {9:40 PM} on Monday, his shift guarding Carrow. Naturally, I gathered the Aurors on call and Apparated to an adjoining room at once.<br/>
We enter a narrative frame in which Granger describes past events.<br/>
Granger, Shacklebolt, and Tonks are standing in the Auror Office lounge. They Apparate from there to a different room, where there is a doorway. Voices are heard from the next room.<br/>
ALECTO {not yet visible}: Please don't hurt him, I don't want more trouble&ndash;<br/>
HARRY {not yet visible}: This isn't about you, Carrow, it's about the people he'll&ndash;<br/>
Harry, Alecto, and three others come into view through the door.<br/>
GRANGER: Stun, then shield. Aim high.<br/>
The next room is furnished with a candelabra and a writing desk. The desk has a parchment and quill pen on it, but the inkwell has been knocked over and spilled across the page. Near the desk, Harry is standing over John Dawlish, who is wearing a trench coat identical to the one Granger wears, and bleeding from the shoulder. Harry is pointing zir wand at Dawlish, who is desperately trying to defend zemself.<br/>
HARRY: Sectumse&ndash; { The beginning of "sectumsempra", the incantation for a curse that causes severe cuts on the victim's body. }<br/>
DAWLISH: Prote&ndash; { The beginning of "protego", the incantation for the Shield Charm. }<br/>
Luna and a silhouetted figure stand nearby, wands out. Near Dawlish, Alecto Carrow is sitting on the floor, with one wrist chained to a leg of the desk behind zem. Ze has zir eyes closed tight.<br/>
ALECTO: Please, no! No, no, no&ndash;<br/>
SHACKLEBOLT, GRANGER, AND TONKS: Stupefy! { The incantation of the Stunning Spell. }<br/>
Jets of red light shoot everywhere. The candelabra breaks and falls. Harry gets hit in the back of the head and crumples to the floor. Luna appears to get hit in the face, but be unaffected.<br/>
SHACKLEBOLT AND TONKS: Protego!<br/>
GRANGER: Aegidivitrea! { A non-canon spell; loosely, Latin for "glass shield". }<br/>
Following the stunners, the three Aurors approach, surrounded by a huge, round shield made of blue-green glass, plus the regular "Protego" shields.<br/>
LUNA: Oh, hello, Hermione!""",
  "annotation":"""<p>I've waited a long time for Granger to get into a situation where ze wants to use that spell!</p>

<p>In the books, they say that the Killing Curse is unblockable. Presumably, what that means is that the Killing Curse is too powerful to be blocked by <em>magical shields</em>, since, literally speaking, it gets blocked by various things, including a phoenix, an animated stone statue, and the power of love. Granger doesn't like relying on lucky circumstances, so ze decided to develop a spell that could block the Killing Curse reliably. In <i>Voldemort's Children</i>, love can't block curses, so ze had to stick to using a physical object.</p>

<p>So, Granger invented "Aegidivitrea", the Glass Shield Charm (ze's very practical about naming things). It conjures a thick shield of glass around the caster and anyone else the caster wishes to protect, and continuously keeps the glass hovering in the air. Since it's a solid object, almost all curses will bounce off of it. The easiest way to attack the shield is with a spell like the Blasting Curse ("Confringo"), but those spells can be blocked normally, so when coupled with the regular Shield Charm, as the three Aurors are doing here, it's very hard to attack.</p>

<p>The main catch is that conjuration is permanent in this universe. It's easy to make the glass disappear again, but if you become incapacitated somehow and can't do that, there's a ton of unsupported glass ready to fall down on top of you. So the Aurors only use the spell when they are travelling in groups of two or more, so that they can cover for each other. And fighting in groups is the ideal way for Aurors to operate in any case.</p>

<p>(You might think there's another weakness in that the shield blocks spells you cast from the inside just as much as it blocks spells your opponents cast from the outside, but it's easy to create little holes in the shield to cast spells from, while your opponents will have a very hard time hitting those holes accurately.)</p>""",

However, there have been recorded instances in which even the Disarming Charm has hurled a person clear across a room, resulting in injury or death. { pause } No Auror has killed a person by accident since before Voldemort's defeat.

<p>Who is Dawlish talking to? Ze could be muttering to zemself, or ze could be talking to Gawain Robards, the one further to the right.

<p>I think there are about twenty Aurors in total. The four in the front are the senior Aurors (whom you can also recognize by their darker coats/robes). To gain seniority, an Auror has to both be exceptionally skilled and be around for a long time. Tonks is skilled enough to be one, but ze's relatively new. Dawlish probably isn't skilled enough to qualify; ze was granted seniority under the somewhat corrupt leadership of Rufus Scrimgeour.

<p>I decided not to have Moody retire &ndash; there's no particular reason for that, but I wanted to have zem as a character to play with, and making zem be a current Auror was an easy way to make zem relevant to the plot.

<br/>
A metaphorical image: Voldemort's two hands, at a huge scale, loom into the page from the left and right. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, at a much smaller scale (their entire bodies are barely bigger than Voldemort's hands) dangle from them; Voldemort is lifting them by the backs of the necks of their robes, strangling them. Their faces are reddened. Harry is in zir usual student robes, but Draco is in a white robe. As usual, Harry's body is significantly bulkier and rougher-looking than Draco's. Both of them have all body parts except their heads concealed in the robes, making them look a bit like cocoons. Both of them are staring into space; they have fairly neutral expressions, and aren't looking at each other or away from each other, as if each is alone in space. Harry doesn't have zir glasses on.<br/>

  "transcript":"""Granger is speaking to Harry in the interrogation cell.<br/>
GRANGER: This morning, you were telling us about your third year. You must have met Sirius Black that year, after he was released.<br/>
The word "released" opens into a narrative frame with one image in it, of Sirius being released from Azkaban. In front of Sirius, a junior Auror is carrying two broomsticks, and offering one to Sirius. Behind zem, two Dementors are standing near a barred gateway. The Dementors wear dark cloaks, but glow with pale light, and only blackness can be seen under their hoods. The glow also covers part of Sirius. Sirius's face shows no emotion.<br/>
GRANGER: We had hoped he could take care of you.<br/>
HARRY: It was not Sirius who would take care of anyone that year. But I did meet him.<br/>
We enter a narrative frame in which Harry describes past events. In the narrative frame, Harry is being escorted by the same junior Auror; they are on the driveway leading up to the door of a house. There are two windows alongside the door, but they are dark; there is nothing to indicate that the house is inhabited.<br/>
PRESENT HARRY: One of your people took me to the house where he was being kept.<br/>
Harry is silhouetted in the door for a moment as ze enters the house. Then ze's inside, looking uncertainly into the darkness.""",
  "annotation":"""<p>The Auror escort is because the location of that house is secret; only a few people are allowed to visit without Sirius explicitly asking for them. This isn't standard practice, but lots of people on both sides might still be interested in getting revenge on Sirius, based on what they believe ze did or didn't do.</p>

<p>The Aurors weren't literally "your [Granger's] people" at the time, but the phrase still works. It's also possible that Harry is using "your people" to mean people in authority in general, as Granger has been on that track almost since the day ze arrived in the magical world.</p>

The narrative frame closes. On the Astronomy Tower, Harry interrupts Draco's narration with zir own.
