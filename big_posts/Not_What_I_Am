<p>&quot;Let's
hide under the bleachers,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;
says Rose.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's
the fun in watching the game the way everyone else watches it?&quot;
I say. I pull at her arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright,&quot;
she says.</p>
<p>Our
middle school is right next to the high school, so we usually go to
watch the games when there's one at the high school right after we
get out. They have this great big field with free-standing bleachers
all along both sides. Sometimes it's fun to come out here when
nothing's happening and run along the long metal seats to hear the
weird warbling noises they make.</p>
<p>Today
there are so many people looking for seats that it's easy for us to
slip off unnoticed. It must be a big game or something. I don't
really care. Mom and Dad always say, &quot;Chloe, it's kids just like
you who are playing in the games,&quot; but what do THEY know,
anyway? But Rose likes to watch the games and Rose is my best friend,
and has been my best friend since second grade, so I usually come and
watch them with her.</p>
<p>The
back side of the bleachers is just completely open. Rose and I are on
the side of the field that faces the woods, so nobody will see us
from behind either. We walk in and peer through the cracks between
the seats.</p>
<p>&quot;This
isn't a very good view,&quot; says Rose.</p>
<p>&quot;You
can get a better view if you do this,&quot; I say. I go belly-down on
the ground and wriggle under so that I'm looking right out from under
the first row of seats. I twist back and call for Rose to join me.
It's noisy enough up there that no one will hear our voices anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;But
it's dirty!&quot; says Rose. I hadn't thought about that. She is
wearing that white dress that she really likes, and even I would be
kind of sad to see it get covered in dirt. Plus, she's a year older
and a lot bigger than I am, so I'm not sure if she'd fit down here
anymore anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Just
pull up your skirt and crouch down next to me. You can probably get
an okay view from three or four rows up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But...!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The
dirt'll brush off just fine later. It's not mud season yet!&quot;</p>
<p>I
feel her kneel down like I suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Shh!&quot;
I say. &quot;Just look! The game's starting.&quot;</p>
<p>I
can mostly keep up with what's going on in the game. I know how
soccer works, basically, but in the high school games there are a
bunch of weird extra rules that aren't like the way we play it in Gym
class, and there are referees who go around and call out that someone
has done something wrong that I don't understand. In general, it
looks like one of the teams is winning way too much and everybody is
kind of frustrated because it's supposed to be a challenge, but now
it's not.</p>
<p>My
neck gets kind of stiff from watching this way, but it's a lot more
fun than just doing things the way you're supposed to. Plus, I get to
have Rose all for myself for an hour or so. I love Rose. She's a
really great friend. She always goes along with my crazy ideas
instead of just looking at me funny or ignoring me like most people
do. And also she knows all kinds of stuff that my other friends don't
because she's older. She was the one who helped me when I had my
first period and was panicking because I didn't want to go to my
parents about it. And she also told me how to do kissing properly,
and more importantly, how to avoid being kissed by people when you
think it's really kind of yucky. And also she gets good grades in
school, although I really don't care that much about that sort of
thing, although I guess I'm a little jealous.</p>
<p>The
game finally comes to an end. I crawl out from under the seats and
join Rose again.</p>
<p>&quot;That
was kind of fun,&quot; she says. Then she looks down at my chest. I
look too.</p>
<p>There's
a layer of dirt covering my entire front. I grin. Rose is sort of
smiling too. I start wildly brushing it off with my hands. Thirty
seconds later, my shirt is still stained, but at least I won't be
dropping clods of dirt on everything. I start to walk out to the
street.</p>
<p>&quot;There's
some on your back too!&quot; says Rose.</p>
<p>&quot;I
don't care,&quot; I say. &quot;Phbbbbbt!&quot; I run away and Rose
chases me, laughing. Normally she's faster than me, but this time I
have to slow down and let her catch up because I'm in jeans and she's
in a long skirt, and she's hanging back because she doesn't want me
to fling dirt all over her.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">2.</h2>
<p>I'm
hot and sticky. The heating system for this room is messed up and
Miss Williams won't let us open a window, so the classroom is
boiling. I'd love to sneak out, but we're supposed to get our report
cards today and it would be really awkward to miss that.</p>
<p>Miss
Williams is my homeroom teacher and she's really strict. Most
everyone in her homeroom has gotten a detention from her at some
point, ESPECIALLY me. Everyone's in their seats already, but there's
no way Miss Williams is going to show anyone their report cards until
the first bell, so all the other kids are idling around and gossiping
about whatever it is they gossip about. I'm just sitting still and
trying not to melt into a gooey mush in the heat. I don't really care
what the other kids say so-and-so did with so-and-so else, which
maybe means that deep down I'm really just a goody two shoes.</p>
<p>Out
of nowhere I hear one of their voices say, &quot;Rose said THAT?&quot;
I look around to figure out who said it. There's a couple of girls
sitting to my right. Right now they're doubled over with laughter. I
recognize one of them. Her name is Janet and she tends to ask
annoying questions in class.</p>
<p>&quot;Haha,&quot;
Janet is saying, &quot;She is so stuck-up.&quot;</p>
<p>I
jump up from my seat. &quot;Rose is NOT stuck-up,&quot; I say loudly.
The whole class turns to look at us.</p>
<p>&quot;I
didn't mean it that way,&quot; says Janet hastily.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
sit in your seat,&quot; says Miss Williams.</p>
<p>&quot;I
just mean she's not always that fun to be around,&quot; Janet
continues. Her face is getting redder by the second.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't
say that about my friend, you big jerk!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
am I going to have to call the office?&quot;</p>
<p>I
sit down quickly. &quot;I'm sorry, Miss Williams.&quot; Then the bell
rings. Everyone gets quiet. Janet glares at me in silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Now
class,&quot; says Miss Williams, &quot;I'm going to hand out your
report cards now, and I want you to...&quot; and I tune her out.
Obviously she's just saying the same things she said the last two
times she handed our our report cards, like &quot;make sure your
parents sign them and bring them back before next week&quot; or maybe
&quot;make sure your dog doesn't eat it because if it does then
you'll be in detention every day until you get your dog to barf it up
and bring it back to us.&quot; My grades are as bad as anyone else's
but I'm not really worried about my parents seeing them. After all,
it's not like they'll be worse than they were last time. Maybe Mom
will give her little &quot;I think you should be trying to get a
better grade than a D+ in History&quot; speech but then she'll forget
about it after a couple of days anyway.</p>
<p>Miss
Williams hands me my report card with the tight-lipped expression she
usually uses for me in general. &quot;You're biting your nails
again,&quot; she scolds.</p>
<p>I'd
hardly noticed I was doing it. I pull my hand out of my mouth.
&quot;Sorry, Miss,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>I
rip the report card open and glance over the usual litany of
&quot;Teacher's Comments&quot;, like &quot;Further effort necessary
to succeed&quot; and &quot;Would benefit from regular attendance&quot;.
And then I look at the other side and see my grades for this quarter.
I'm failing history. &quot;History .... F .... Needs Improvement
..... Needs Improvement ..... Would benefit from regular attendance.&quot;
I feel sick. I quickly fold the card and look left and right to make
sure nobody saw it.</p>
<p>After
the second bell, I'm barely out of the classroom when I hear someone
call, &quot;Chloe! Chloe, wait up!&quot; I'm still a little jittery,
so I jump and spook the small girl who called, who's practically
right behind me. I don't know her name, but she's one of the other
kids in my homeroom. She blushes when I look at her. I think she's
pretty shy.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
Maureen,&quot; she says. &quot;You're really brave!&quot;</p>
<p>I
figure she must be talking about what I said to Janet, but I don't
think that was really that brave. I just don't like it when people
say bad things about Rose. And I'm not sure it really counts as
bravery to stand up to someone who's as silly as Janet, anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Are
you a friend of Rose?&quot; Maureen asks excitedly. &quot;I want to
meet all Rose's friends.&quot; She's looking up at me, which feels
weird because it basically never happens, because I'm kind of short
AND I hardly ever stand up straight. I can already feel myself
slouching a bit more to make it less weird. And it also feels weird
that she's getting excited about me, because I'm not really that good
at anything. But anyway, I let her tag along with me, because what
else am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Later
that day, I run into Leah. Leah's one of Rose's friends in eighth
grade. She's almost as tall as Rose, and a bunch fatter. I've met her
a few times before. Rose says she's really cool.</p>
<p>&quot;I
heard about what you did this morning,&quot; Leah says. &quot;It was
really brave of you to stick up for Rose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
not THAT brave,&quot; I say. I hope I don't get more people telling
me that. It could get really irritating. &quot;It's just that Janet
is such a jerk!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,
now, Janet's not that bad. She's only being an ass because Rose won
'Best Role Model' and she didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot;
I say. &quot;Wait, are you a friend of Janet's too?&quot; Leah nods.
&quot;Then why are you being nice to me when I just called her a jerk
in front of everybody?&quot;</p>
<p>She
puts up a hand. &quot;I'm Rose's friend, too,&quot; she says. &quot;Rose
is a really nice, really good person. It makes me really sad when
other nice people like Janet have trouble seeing that. Janet's
usually nice,&quot; she says. I hadn't thought about it that way. I
think people are usually either nice to everyone or jerks to
everyone. It seems weird for a someone to be nice to most people and
then randomly be a jerk to some other perfectly good people for no
real reason.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">3.</h2>
<p>I'm
in front of Rose's house, shivering a little, a couple days later.
The wind is cold. Mr. Garibaldi kept us late after school today, so I
didn't catch up with Rose before she got home, so now I have to wait
for someone to answer the doorbell. Rose made sure to tell me to be
on my best behavior around her parents, especially her mom.</p>
<p>I
haven't been to Rose's house before because her parents didn't let
her have guests over. But she had really good grades, all As and B
plusses, on the report card that just went out, so they decided to
let her invite people over, as a reward. I still haven't shown mine
to my parents. I wish I had ANY As or B plusses. Then I wouldn't be
putting it off so much.</p>
<p>The
door opens at last. I flinch a little when I see a middle-aged woman
standing above me in the doorway. It's almost certainly Rose's mom. I
try to stand up straight and put my hands where she can't see them,
but it's no good. Right away she sees my dirty jeans and all the
tangles I didn't bother to brush out of my hair this morning.</p>
<p>&quot;You
are Chloe?&quot; she says stiffly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,
ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A
guest of Rose's, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,
ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come
in.&quot;</p>
<p>I
step in the door and then bend over to untie my shoes. I can feel her
eyes on my back. I hope I've won some points with her for knowing
take off my shoes for myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank
heavens you have the sense not to track mud on my poor carpets,&quot;
she says. Since the walk going up to Rose's door is paved, there
obviously isn't any mud on my sneakers anyway. I decide it probably
wouldn't be a good idea to tell that to Rose's mom.</p>
<p>&quot;Rose
is in the living room,&quot; she says, pointing through a door.</p>
<p>I
don't really need her directions because I can hear the sound of
Rose's voice. The house looks really nice though. Everything looks
shiny and clean and textured. Except the carpets, which aren't shiny.
Rose's mom follows me down the hallway and, again, pointlessly shows
me the open door to the living room. I step in and see a wide room
with plate glass windows on one wall and a really shiny wood table in
the middle surrounded by couches and plush chairs. I don't see Rose
at first, because she's lying on one of the couches. There's another
girl who I don't recognize lying across from her.</p>
<p>&quot;And
how do we greet our guests?&quot; says Rose's mom.</p>
<p>Rose
strains to sit up on the couch. She's obviously exhausted. &quot;Good
afternoon, Chloe,&quot; she says stiffly, and suddenly I see the
family resemblance. I've never seen Rose look so completely boring. I
wish her mom would go away.</p>
<p>&quot;Have
Katherine and Chloe been introduced to each other?&quot;</p>
<p>Rose
hauls herself to her feet. The other girl, who must be Katherine,
sits up too. Katherine looks pretty tired too, but not as much as
Rose does.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
this is Katherine Halley. She's in my Physical Education class.
Katherine, this is Chloe Martin. She's a... friend of mine. She's in
seventh grade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enjoy
yourselves, girls,&quot; says Rose's mom, and she disappears into the
hallway. We all relax. Rose and Katherine flop back down on the
couches. I get one of the other chairs and drag it over to face both
of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,
dang it,&quot; says Katherine. She's reaching for a water bottle
that's on the floor, but she can't quite reach without getting up
from where she's lying. &quot;I should have put my water bottle where
I could reach it before lying down in this absolutely luxurious couch
you seem to have here.&quot; Rose and I giggle, then Rose drags
herself up again, leans over, and picks up the water bottle and hands
it to Katherine. &quot;Thanks, Rose, you're great,&quot; says
Katherine. Rose stumbles back to the other couch and collapses again.</p>
<p>P.E.
is Rose's last class of the day on most days. &quot;Hard gym class?&quot;
I ask.</p>
<p>&quot;It's
not the gym class that was bad. It's... well, first Mr. Bantley made
me take something to the office near the end of my last class, and
then it took me almost ten minutes to find who I was supposed to give
it to at the office, and then I had to go all the way to the other
end of the building to get to gym, and then Ms. Jarvis made me run an
extra lap around the gym for being late, and then I twisted my ankle
while doing jumping jacks, and then the entire building exploded, and
then... okay, I made that last one up,&quot; says Rose. She's
hilarious when she's tired. &quot;And I stayed up really late with
Leah last night, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Rose
once told me that she gets sick and nervous if she stays up too late.
&quot;I thought you didn't like staying up late,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Leah
was having fun. I thought she'd be mad if I just left. It wasn't that
bad,&quot; she says. She puts one hand to her face. &quot;What's the
point of even having us change into gym clothes and then back to
normal clothes afterwards? I still feel disgusting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't
you have a swimming pool in your back yard?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>Katherine
perks up. &quot;That would be a great way to relax,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>Rose
gets up again and goes to look for old swimsuits for us to wear,
which gives me a chance to look around the room. It is definitely a
really nice room. Behind where Rose was sitting, there's a fireplace
filled with some pretty convincing fake logs. On the shelf above the
fireplace there's a bunch of little pots and sculptures that Rose
made in art class. I've seen some of them before because Rose showed
them to me. They look like the kind of thing that everybody else says
is really good but isn't actually that good. They're okay, I guess.
One time when I told her that, Rose said she's glad I tell her what I
actually think instead of just saying that everything she does is
really good.</p>
<p>Rose
is still away, so I spend the time by asking Katherine how she knows
Rose. It turns out she isn't THAT close a friend of Rose's after all.
They're friends because of P.E. since the beginning of this year, but
not much before that.</p>
<p>&quot;Janet's
throwing one of her parties tonight, and I usually go to them,&quot;
says Katherine. &quot;I'm not really up to dealing with her crowd
today, so I needed an excuse not to come. So I said I was with Rose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;
I say sarcastically. &quot;Is there some kind of game going on here?
Team Rose versus Team Janet?&quot;</p>
<p>Katherine
laughs. &quot;Chloe, is it? I heard you scored a buttload of points
for Team Rose this Monday.&quot;</p>
<p>I
roll my eyes. &quot;Is there anyone who hasn't heard about that?
Don't tell me I'm brave!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright,
I won't. You're an unspeakable coward, and also a ninny!&quot; I'm
starting to really like Katherine. Especially when she uses fancy
words like <em>unspeakable</em>.</p>
<p>Rose
comes back carrying three swimming suits and lays them out on the
living room table. There's one with pastel-colored flowery patterns
that I remember Rose wearing a few years ago, which is obviously for
me because it's much smaller than the others. Then there's an orange
one and a black one. Katherine looks disappointed. Probably she isn't
sure whether they'll fit her, since she's a bit bigger and heavier
than Rose is.</p>
<p>&quot;Take
the orange one,&quot; says Rose. &quot;It's a bit bigger. It'll
stretch, anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Rose
has us change one at a time in the bathroom. I don't see why we waste
the time, really. It's not like anyone's looking. When my turn comes
I'm happy to fling my day clothes on the bathroom floor. Rose's old
swimsuit feels a little funny because it's a one-piece and I'm used
to wearing bikinis, and also because I think flower patterns are kind
of silly, but it fits just fine. Rose goes last and she comes out of
the bathroom a little nervously, but she looks great. The shapes of
her bare legs and arms stand out really clearly next to the black
fabric of the swimsuit, and her hair falls really nicely over her
shoulders. I can't wait to see how she looks once she's in the water.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot;
says Rose. &quot;Let's go. Just don't splash too much.&quot; She
leads us to the back door and we step out onto a porch that looks
over the back yard. Her backyard is really nice. There must be a
fence back there somewhere, but you can't see it through the trees.
The pool is out in front of us. It's crystal clear and it must be
about fifty feet long. I can see the reflections of the trees in the
surface of the water. The grass is bright green and flat, and it's
all framed really beautifully through the posts that hold up the
porch's overhanging roof.</p>
<p>Right
away, Katherine leaps down the porch steps and runs and jumps into
the water. She and her orange swimsuit make a big splash. Rose and I
follow more slowly. Katherine gives a whoop and waves for us to hurry
up.</p>
<p>Rose
and I sit down together on the concrete edge of the pool. I dip my
legs in and then slowly slide my whole body down into the pool. The
warm water feels wonderful as it slips over my skin, and it makes me
feel nearly weightless. I let the ends of my hair drag in the water
while my chin rests just above the surface. My arms and legs float
lazily, without me trying to move them. It probably feels even better
for Katherine, because she's just had that exhausting gym class.
Katherine's floating on her back now, with a really contented look on
her face. I wish I was good enough at swimming to do that.</p>
<p>Rose
is being weird though. She's still just sitting up on the edge of the
pool and shivering a little. She has her bare legs folded up in front
of her. I wave to try to get her attention.</p>
<p>&quot;This
is a great pool,&quot; I say. &quot;My house doesn't have a pool like
this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's
not as nice as the one Leah has,&quot; says Rose. She has her arms
crossed over her knees. She idly pokes at the water with one bare
foot.</p>
<p>I
pull one of my hands out of the water and splash some of it at her.</p>
<p>&quot;You're
not supposed to splash water out of the pool,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>Just
then, Katherine swims up and splashes Rose with a LOT of water. I can
hear her chuckling over my shoulder. Rose is soaked. &quot;Now you'll
have to get in or you'll be freezing,&quot; says Katherine.</p>
<p>I
take one of Rose's legs and she lets me pull her into the water. Her
body slides down next to mine, so close that I can feel the
underwater waves her body produces roll against my skin. I splash at
her playfully a couple of times. I wish she'd splash back. I would
love it for Rose to get me soaking wet. But she just leans up against
the side of the pool and exhales. She doesn't look so great now. She
looks really stiff and not lively at all, and her hair just looks
kind of matted now that the water is all over it. I let myself float
away from her a little and watch as she breathes heavily.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">4.</h2>
<p>&quot;Chloe?&quot;
Mom's voice comes down the basement stairs. The basement is my space
because the door to the basement can be locked from the inside. I
love my brothers, but when they were at home, sometimes I just wanted
to punch them. Sometimes I actually did punch them, but that's not
the point. The point is that I just like to be away from them
sometimes, and that's why the basement belongs to me. We used to
fight over it all the time because the TV was down there, but
eventually our parents got fed up and bought a nicer TV and put it
upstairs in our living room, which meant that they could stay up
there and me stay down here most of the time.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
your father and I want to talk to you.&quot;</p>
<p>I
sigh and throw down my copy of <i>The Golden Compass</i>, which I'm
re-reading for the fifth time. It's probably about my grades. I left
my report card on my dad's desk yesterday. I know I should have just
given it to them, but that would be so uncomfortable, even with Dad.
No, especially with Dad. He'd take it, then look at it, then LOOK at
me. And then say &quot;I need to talk to your mother about this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And
put a shirt on,&quot; Mom continues. &quot;This is important.&quot;</p>
<p>I
bend over to get one of my shirts that I've strewn on the floor. It's
a white T-shirt with green and black splotches from where I spilled
paint on it earlier this week in Art class. I never really want to
wear any clothing ever, except when it's really cold out, but for
some reason, Mom and Dad complain if I'm not wearing at least a bra
and panties when I walk around the house. I don't really mind getting
dressed when they ask me to, but it just seems completely pointless.</p>
<p>I
trudge up the stairs and find them waiting in the dining room.
They're sitting next to each other at the big table, and they've
already pulled out a third chair for me to sit in, so I flop down in
it right away.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't
slouch,&quot; says Mom. I sit up. Mom looks over at Dad, which means
she wants him to start the conversation. Dad looks back, which means
he doesn't want to. Finally they look at me.</p>
<p>&quot;We're
concerned about your performance in school,&quot; says Dad.</p>
<p>&quot;You
mean my bad grades?&quot; I say. I can see my report card sitting
between them on the table.</p>
<p>Dad
looks at Mom.</p>
<p>&quot;It's
more than bad grades,&quot; says Mom. &quot;Your teachers tell me
you've been skipping class.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I
don't skip class THAT often,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly
how often <em>do</em> you skip class?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I
only skip class when it's totally BORING.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honey,
last week you said that school is always totally boring.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I
did NOT,&quot; I say. &quot;I like Art class. Look, I'm getting a B
in Art.&quot;</p>
<p>She
looks. &quot;That's a B minus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's
still a B,&quot; I say. I lean back in the chair, and it shifts under
me. &quot;When are you going to fix this chair? It's wobbly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're
changing the subject,&quot; says Dad.</p>
<p>&quot;Honey,&quot;
Mom begins. I don't like it when she calls me that. &quot;We were
willing to overlook your behavior when you were <em>passing</em> your
classes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
still passing most of them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,&quot;
Dad interrupts, &quot;This isn't a joke. Listen to your mother.&quot;</p>
<p>Mom
says, &quot;Your father and I have agreed that if we don't start
seeing some improvement, you may have to start losing some privileges
around this house.&quot;</p>
<p>I
stare at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Do
you understand that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot;
I say thickly.</p>
<p>&quot;And
you'll try to do better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Mom
and Dad look at each other again. Mom is giving her little
I-guess-that'll-have-to-do frown. She takes a pen, quietly signs her
name at the bottom of the report card, and hands it to me. I fold it
up without looking at it and walk away.</p>
<p>I
turn the corner to get to the top of the basement stairs, then I have
an idea. I step up and down on the top stair so it sounds like I'm
going down, but instead, I listen hard to what Mom and Dad are saying
back in the dining room.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter
and Geoffrey never had trouble in school,&quot; Mom is saying. &quot;I
just don't know what the problem is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's
normal for children to be rebellious at this age,&quot; says Dad.
&quot;I'm sure she'll grow out of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But
what if she doesn't? She's always been different from the other
girls. What if...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Love,
relax. I'm sure she'll be fine.&quot;</p>
<p>I
close the door quietly behind me and tiptoe down the stairs. I sit
back down on the couch and pick up <i>The Golden Compass</i>, but I
only end up staring blankly at the pages. The conversation plays back
in my head. &quot;She's not like her brothers. She's got a problem.
What if she doesn't grow out of it? She's different.&quot;</p>
<p>I
feel like I'm going to cry. I hate crying. It makes me feel like such
a wimp. And anyway, Rose doesn't cry, so why should I?</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">5.</h2>
<p>I
scurry over to the light switch and flip it off so that the only
light comes from the TV screen and the little window near the
ceiling. We're at my house, in the basement, watching movies in our
underwear. We've had a bit of a tradition of doing this since a long
time ago. I like it because I get to hang out with Rose, and Rose
likes it because she always has to wear clothing when she's at her
own house. I wish there was a place that was as nice as Rose's house
but didn't have Rose's mom living in it.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
don't <em>do</em> that,&quot; says Rose.</p>
<p>Don't
do what? I wonder. I look down.</p>
<p>We're
on one of those couches with the backs that can tilt back, and we
have it tilted all the way back, with our feet facing the TV. It fits
well for Rose, but my feet don't quite reach the footrest if I lie
with my back the way I like it best, so I usually just let my feet
hang down between the seat and the footrest while Rose lies there the
way you're supposed to. This time I also have my right hand up at my
mouth and I'm biting my nails. &quot;Sorry,&quot; I say. I've been
trying to shake the habit, but it's not working and I'm not really
trying very hard at it anyway. I should try harder. I really want
Rose to like me.</p>
<p>&quot;You
were being noisy about it,&quot; says Rose. &quot;Make sure you don't
do that at my house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot;
I say again. I shove my hands under my butt to keep myself from doing
it more. Rose turns back to keep watching the movie.</p>
<p>Rose
has a really nice way of lying there. She always has good posture. I
usually slouch all the time, or sort of curl up sideways whenever I
sit in a nice comfortable chair, although obviously I can't do that
right now because I'm lying all the way back and sitting on both my
hands. Rose's body is straightened out, though, and her shoulders are
nice and even. I also can't help but notice that her breasts have
come out a lot more than mine have, and I'm a little jealous, but I
guess I should expect that because she's a year older than me anyway.
Her hair is pulled back in a really neat and practical way, and I
really want to just reach over and mess it up, but I can't do that
because I'm sitting on my hands. So I turn back to the screen
instead.</p>
<p>In
the movie, the male lead actor is being sent on some sort of a wild
goose chase by someone's friends to make sure he doesn't find about
about something that some other person is hiding from someone else.
Rose picked the movie this time. I feel like I've seen it before, but
I can't really remember it that well. There's a male lead and a
female lead who are falling in love with each other and have all
kinds of misadventures on the way. I don't recognize the actors
though.</p>
<p>Near
the end of the movie, when they're finally getting together and the
male lead bends down to kiss the female lead, I half-roll over on top
of Rose and kiss her.</p>
<p>&quot;Girls
can't kiss girls,&quot; she says. The movie continues playing behind
me.</p>
<p>Her
deep blue eyes are right in front of mine. &quot;But I like you,&quot;
I say.</p>
<p>&quot;You're
supposed to kiss boys you like, not girls,&quot; she says. &quot;It's
different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot;
I say. I roll back and just lie next to her instead. Maybe I
shouldn't have kissed her in the first place. I don't know. I hadn't
done it before, but it just felt right this time for some reason. Now
I don't feel so good. I still like her though. I lay my arm alongside
her arm and intertwine my fingers with hers, and we lie like that
while the movie plays out the rest of the way. The trouble is that I
keep catching myself biting my nails on the hand that's not holding
hers.</p>
<p>The
credits come up, finally. I go and turn the lights on again. While
I'm walking back, I notice <i>The Golden Compass</i> on the table. I
finished it a couple of days ago, and I've been meaning to take it
back to the library and check out the sequel, but I just haven't
gotten around to it. But it reminds me of what Mom said the other
day.</p>
<p>&quot;Rose,&quot;
I say quickly, before I can think better of it, &quot;How do you get
such good grades?&quot;</p>
<p>Rose
looks up. &quot;I didn't think you cared about grades.&quot;</p>
<p>I
don't know what to tell her. I thought I didn't care about grades,
too. I don't want to tell her what my parents said because it doesn't
sound that bad. It really isn't that bad. I don't know why I've been
feeling so upset about it.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe?
Is something the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh,&quot;
I say. I notice I've just been standing there with my mouth open. I
feel stupid. &quot;I'm failing History,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;
says Rose. I guess I said the right thing. Rose goes on, &quot;I
don't really know how I get good grades. I just do. I mean, I do the
work for the classes, and I guess I'm good at it. It's mostly about
doing the work.&quot;</p>
<p>I
frown a bit. Even when I DO do the work, the teachers sometimes mark
it wrong even though I think what I wrote makes sense. But I need to
get better grades, so I guess I have to listen to what Rose is
saying.</p>
<p>&quot;I
think you could get good grades if you worked harder at it,&quot; she
says.</p>
<p>That
evening, after Rose goes home, I sit down and try to get some work
done. I have a worksheet for History. It's a list of ten words from
the reading, and I'm supposed to write at least two complete
sentences to define each of the words. I get my textbook and start
finding the words and writing down what the book says about them, but
it's ridiculously boring. By the time I finish the third definition,
I'm bored out of my mind, so I throw the book across the room and it
lands on its edge and the cheap front cover folds in half. I hate
doing homework.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">6.</h2>
<p>&quot;Hey,
can you grab me an eraser?&quot; says Leah to me. Leah and I are
lying on the floor of Rose's living room. Books and papers are strewn
across the carpet as we work.</p>
<p>It's
been a few weeks since Mom and Dad told me I needed to start
improving my grades. I haven't been having much luck. Rose invited me
to come and study with her other friends. They're mostly eighth
graders, so they don't have the same work, but they're helping me
out. And I also just love being at Rose's house. It would be such a
nice house if her parents didn't live there.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot;
says Leah as I hand her the eraser. &quot;Hey Rose, wasn't Katherine
supposed to be coming?&quot;</p>
<p>Just
then, the doorbell rings. Rose steps out of the room and comes back a
minute later with Katherine. Katherine looks funny. Her face is a
little red and puffy.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow,
are you okay?&quot; says Leah.</p>
<p>&quot;Not
really,&quot; says Katherine irritably. &quot;You don't have to ask
about it. I'm here for the study party, not the pity party.&quot;</p>
<p>Katherine
dumps her stuff on the table and starts getting out her books. I look
back at my own work. I'm still having a little trouble getting into
it. I don't CARE what a monocot or a dicot is. When am I ever going
to need to know the difference between a monocot and a dicot? I flip
through my Science textbook and circle a few boxes. I don't know if
they're the right answers. Maybe dicots really are the ones with
three-part flowers. I don't care.</p>
<p>&quot;AAARRRRRRRGGGHHHHH!&quot;
Katherine yells. I hear a thunk as she flops facedown on the table.</p>
<p>Rose
helps her up.</p>
<p>&quot;I
thought I'd be able to concentrate on the work,&quot; says Katherine
miserably.</p>
<p>Rose's
dad appears in the doorway. &quot;Is everything all right?&quot; he
says crisply.</p>
<p>Rose
answers, &quot;Yes, Dad. Katherine is only stressed. She's dealing
with a difficult family situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Rose's
dad shifts a little. &quot;Well, tell me if you need anything. And
try not to yell. You scared me.&quot; Then he goes away again.</p>
<p>&quot;I
should just leave,&quot; mumbles Katherine.</p>
<p>&quot;It's
not a problem,&quot; says Rose hastily.</p>
<p>&quot;We
care about you,&quot; says Leah.</p>
<p>I
don't get it. What's the big thing they're all talking about?</p>
<p>&quot;Well,
if that's how it's going, I might as well call Janet too,&quot; says
Katherine. &quot;She lives near here anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Katherine
takes out a cell phone. I'm kind of jealous. Mom and Dad say they
won't let me have a cell phone until I'm in high school. On the other
hand, I'm glad for the excuse to stop working on this stupid Science.</p>
<p>&quot;Why's
she calling Janet?&quot; I whisper to Rose.</p>
<p>&quot;She's
gotten really close to Janet recently...&quot; she whispers back.</p>
<p>Katherine
finishes the call and leans back. &quot;I hate how trite it sounds,&quot;
she says. &quot;'Katherine is stressed.' 'Katherine is dealing with a
difficult family situation.' Katherine is dealing with her mom
shouting at her dad all afternoon. Let's just make sure we never say
what we mean!&quot;</p>
<p>Well,
that doesn't seem SO bad. My mom and dad shout at each other
sometimes. It'd be nicer if they didn't, but I wouldn't really make a
big deal about it.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't
she moving out sometime?&quot; says Rose.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,
THAT's something to look forward to!&quot; says Katherine loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
so sorry, I didn't mean–&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,
you're right. It'll be easier afterwards. But that's not for almost a
month.&quot;</p>
<p>When
the doorbell rings again, Rose and Leah are still in the middle of
talking to Katherine about that, so I go to answer the door for them.
I don't know what I think about Katherine's mom, anyway. I wouldn't
want MY mom to move out. I mean, I don't like it when she goes all &quot;I
am disappointed that you are not succeeding in school&quot; on me,
and she does that all the time, but I wouldn't want her to leave or
anything. I think it's weird that Katherine's mom is moving out. I'm
glad I have NORMAL parents, not like Katherine's or Rose's.</p>
<p>I
open the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot;
says Janet. &quot;It's you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come
on in,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
sorry about what I said about Rose,&quot; she says. &quot;I was just
mad that day. It doesn't mean anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's
okay,&quot; I say. &quot;I know you're really a nice person.&quot;</p>
<p>I
lead Janet in to the room where the others are waiting. When she sees
Katherine, she runs and hugs her. It ends up being really awkward
because Katherine was sitting on the couch and didn't manage to get
up before Janet crashed into her, but they both smile about it right
afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;How
bad was it?&quot; says Janet. She curls up next to Katherine, and
Katherine puts an arm around her.</p>
<p>&quot;It
wasn't the worst. I just had to ask my mom for something while she
was in the middle of... you know,&quot; says Katherine. &quot;She
kind of jumped on me. Sometimes I just need to get out of my house.
I'm glad we were having this study group.&quot;</p>
<p>Leah
looks up. &quot;If you ever need a place to chill, you can come to my
house. My parents are hardly ever home,&quot; she says. &quot;Here,
I'll give you my number.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot;
says Katherine. She heaves a sigh and rolls her eyes while she's
entering Leah's number into her phone. &quot;I hope you don't mind if
I actually take you up on that offer sometime...&quot;</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">7.</h2>
<p>At
school, Maureen is starting to show up everywhere I go. Obviously,
she's in all my core classes because she's in the same homeroom, but
it turns out she's in almost all my classes, period. And when we're
not in classes, she tags along with me when I go to my locker or go
to lunch.</p>
<p>&quot;Can
you help me with this?&quot; she asks one math class.</p>
<p>&quot;I
doubt it,&quot; I say. &quot;I'm getting a C- in this class.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd
be getting an A+ if Mr. Fantoni didn't make you lose all those points
for being late!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,
really,&quot; I say, but Maureen doesn't seem to buy it. I guess I'll
help her with the work after all.</p>
<p>We're
both doing a worksheet where you multiply and add fractions with each
other. I look at Maureen's work. She's written down a bunch of stuff
and erased a lot of it. I haven't written anything down because I
don't really care. I only really have to do enough of the work to
pass the class.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright,&quot;
I say. &quot;Here, look. In this first one, you just have to multiply
the two fractions. And that just means multiplying the top numbers
together and the bottom numbers together...&quot; I demonstrate on my
own sheet with some lines and arrows and a little calculation when I
have to multiply 13 by 8.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow,
you're really good!&quot; says Maureen.</p>
<p>The
class goes on for a while like that. I actually end up doing most of
my worksheet, and so does she. I think it seems kind of silly for her
to be telling me that I'm great at this when I'm clearly only decent
at best, but by the end of the class, I actually kind of feel like I
know what I'm doing. It feels a little weird being the one who knows
what she's doing, since I usually hang out with Rose and Rose is
better than me at just about everything, but it feels nice, and I
kind of like having Maureen following me around after all.</p>
<p>Later
that day, she sneaks out of gym class with me.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,
you don't have to sneak out just because I do,&quot; I say. &quot;You
could get in trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll
only get in the same trouble you get in!&quot; she says. I don't
think I'm really worth getting that excited over, but it's cute.</p>
<p>I
check that no one's coming and then slip out a side door with
Maureen. We sit on a big rock outside the back of the school. Then I
dig in my backpack and pull out <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban</i>. I also had <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i> in there but I
think it's not quite Maureen's style.</p>
<p>Maureen
grins. &quot;Will you read it out loud to me?&quot; she says.</p>
<p>I
grin back, then I open to my bookmark and begin to read. We spend the
whole afternoon reading. It's much more fun than going to class. The
funny thing is that I'm actually doing better at all my classes with
Maureen around. I seem to understand things much better when I
explain them to her than when I actually do them myself, and I do a
lot of work that I wouldn't have done if she didn't ask me to help me
with it.</p>
<p>In
the morning a couple days later I'm chasing a laughing Marueen
through the halls. Someone yells at us not to run in the halls, but
they must be stupid because it's not like they can do anything about
it if they're not going to run and catch us. 
</p>
<p>Then
Maureen trips and falls. I tumble over her. She screams.</p>
<p>I
get up and help her up. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; I say. &quot;That
sounded really bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My
leg hurts,&quot; she says. I can tell. She's standing funny. I wince
at the thought. I wish she hadn't gotten hurt.</p>
<p>&quot;Do
you want to go to the nurse?&quot; I say. Then I notice the time.
It's almost time for Miss Williams's class, and she usually gives me
a detention when I'm late to class. We have English with Miss
Williams in the middle of the day, which is horrible because it means
we have to see her at the beginning of the day, the end of the day,
AND the middle of the day. I don't think anyone likes having class
with Miss Williams.</p>
<p>&quot;Um,&quot;
I say. I don't want to get a detention. But I can't just leave
Maureen here with her leg hurting so much either. So I walk with her
to the nurse.</p>
<p>The
nurse looks at Maureen's leg and asks a few questions, and eventually
says it's only a bruise, but it hurts a lot because it's her knee.
The nurse makes a bag full of ice and water and gives it to Maureen
to hold on her knee for a while. I'm not sure it's just a bruise.
Maureen is limping pretty badly on our way back to class.</p>
<p>I
try to slip into the overheated classroom after Maureen, hoping Miss
Williams won't notice me.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
Maureen, you're late.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We
were at the nurse,&quot; I say. &quot;Maureen hurt her leg.&quot; But
I can tell it's no better than the excuses I usually make up when I'm
late to class, and she doesn't believe it. &quot;Look, we have a
pass.&quot; I show her the hall pass the nurse gave us. She takes it
and looks at it.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
see me after class,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;
I say. &quot;I have a pass! Look, it has my name on it and
everything!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You
will sit down now, and see me after class.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot;
I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse
me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,
Miss Williams,&quot; I say. I go quietly to my chair and sit down.
I'm already sweating from the heat. Maureen sits down and tries to
find a way to hold the ice and pay attention at the same time. She
has trouble finding a good position.</p>
<p>&quot;Maureen,
stop shifting in your chair,&quot; says Miss Williams.</p>
<p>&quot;But
my leg hurts,&quot; says Maureen.</p>
<p>&quot;Do
you want to go to the nurse?&quot;</p>
<p>She's
so stupid. We obviously JUST came from the nurse's office. And
Maureen's obviously shifting around because she needs to rest her
hand from holding the ice. And the ice isn't even helping that much.
Can't teachers ever understand anything? Maureen tells Miss Williams
that she'll try, just to get Miss Williams to back off, but she can't
sit still. I can't stand hearing them fight. I try not to pay any
attention.</p>
<p>Another
few minutes pass like this. Miss Williams says, &quot;Maureen, you're
distracting the class.&quot;</p>
<p>The
heat is making me crazy. Maureen's leg is killing her and the ice
isn't helping and Miss Williams is trying to make it even worse. I
try to look away and not think about them, but when I look out the
window the sun glares in my face and when I look in the classroom the
electric lights are too bright and when I close my eyes their voices
grate on my ears. Maureen is hurting and no one is helping her. I
open my mouth to yell.</p>
<p>&quot;NO!&quot;
I yell. &quot;YOU'RE distracting the class by lecturing her!&quot;</p>
<p>The
expected response comes back. &quot;Chloe, be quiet. This doesn't
concern you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why
should I be quiet?&quot; I demand. &quot;You're not being quiet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
I'm not going to argue with you. Don't put yourself in more trouble
than you're in already.&quot;</p>
<p>I
jump up out of my chair. My desk falls over with a crash, and I don't
even care. &quot;If you're not going to ARGUE with ME then stop
TORTURING MAUREEN!&quot;</p>
<p>Miss
Williams is at the room phone already. 
</p>
<p>&quot;Hello
... I have a student who has flipped over a desk ... Yes ... Thank
you.&quot;</p>
<p>One
of the Assistant Principals comes and they make me take my stuff and
leave the room and go sit on the bench in the front office. Then they
go into another room and leave me sitting with just the secretary.
The front office is really boring. There's nothing interesting in it.
There used to be a nice secretary who would chat with me when I was
there for detentions or whatever, but the new secretary doesn't like
me. The only thing in the room that isn't boring and businesslike is
the bench, which is where they make you stay when you're in
detention. They've repainted the bench a couple of times, but you can
still see where people have carved swear words and penises and stuff
into it. It's nice for the variety, but really, drawing penises on
things is just as boring as making them look nice and clean.</p>
<p>Eventually
somebody comes out.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe?&quot;
he says.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your
dad is coming to take you home. You can get your bags from your
locker now.&quot;</p>
<p>I
go to my locker, open it, grab my stuff, and slam the door with a
bang. I'm sick of running around the school and doing what they tell
me to. Maybe I should go the other way instead and sneak out one of
the exit doors. But then Dad would show up and I wouldn't be there.</p>
<p>I
punch the locker door a few more times. Bang. Bang. Bang. I end up
scraping my hand a little.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse
me, miss?&quot; One of the other teachers has poked his head out the
door of his classroom. &quot;Where are you supposed to be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
getting my stuff and going to the front office.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,
do that, then. Don't make such a racket.&quot; He ducks back into the
classroom. I make a delicious racket by pounding on the locker door
for a couple of seconds and then run back towards the front office.
It's not like I can get in trouble for it when he didn't even know my
name.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">8.</h2>
<p>Dad
isn't smiling on the car ride home. He usually smiles when he's with
me. I don't like it when he doesn't.</p>
<p>&quot;I
wasn't at home when the school called,&quot; Dad says. &quot;They had
to call your mother at work. She is coming home early to deal with
this.&quot;</p>
<p>I
don't see why Mom has to come home early from work if Dad is the one
picking me up. &quot;What's the big deal?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
you know perfectly well what it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,
I don't,&quot; I say. &quot;Do you mean me getting in trouble? I've
gotten in lots of trouble before and you haven't made a big deal
about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Dad
sighs and keeps paying attention to the road. Sometimes I wish he
would just say what he means.</p>
<p>Eventually
we get home and pull into the garage. I climb out of the car and head
for the basement. Dad follows me.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
go to your room,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>I
smile. &quot;Dad, the basement IS my room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You
know what room I mean.&quot; Dad still isn't smiling. &quot;I want
you to stay there until your mother and I can talk about this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot;
I say. I go upstairs to my bedroom. My bedroom is stupid. Sometimes I
don't even sleep there. The couches in the basement are just as
comfortable as my bed is. And my bedroom has these big windows, and I
like it much better when I'm in a place where I can just turn off the
lights and make sure it stays dark. The windows don't even have a
good view out them, anyway. I hate just being left in places and told
to wait until other people come and get me. I want to sneak back and
listen to whatever Mom and Dad are talking about, but the stairs up
to my room are creaky and I don't think they'd like it if they caught
me.</p>
<p>After
a long time, they call me back down. I sit down facing them at the
table. I stare at them. They stare at me. Then I burst into tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Just
tell me what kind of trouble I'm in,&quot; I sob.</p>
<p>&quot;We're
not going to punish you,&quot; says Mom.</p>
<p>I
didn't expect that. I look at Mom suspiciously. I know she sometimes
says she's not going to do something and then does it anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Your
father and I have agreed that the way we've been handling these
situations hasn't been productive. We want to be able to help you,&quot;
says Mom.</p>
<p>&quot;What
kind of help is it this time?&quot; I say sourly. Last time Mom
wanted to help me, she signed me up for a summer program that I
didn't even like. I don't understand why adults think they know
what's good for me when they mostly just end up wasting my time.</p>
<p>&quot;We
are going to make an appointment for you to see a psychiatrist,&quot;
says Mom.</p>
<p>I
stare at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Please
understand. We just want you to be able to see someone who can help
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I
don't need help,&quot; I say angrily. &quot;There's nothing wrong
with me.&quot; I'm crying again and I hate it. Crying in front of my
parents makes me feel like such a weakling.</p>
<p>&quot;Honey,
we don't think there's anything <em>wrong</em> with you,&quot; says
Mom. &quot;But Peter and Geoffrey never had this kind of trouble in
school...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Geoff
broke another kid's chin with a baseball bat,&quot; I say sourly.</p>
<p>&quot;That's
different,&quot; says Dad.</p>
<p>&quot;How's
it different? Is it because he's a boy? It's okay for boys to break
things?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That
isn't the issue,&quot; says Dad.</p>
<p>&quot;Geoff
never skipped class,&quot; says Mom.</p>
<p>&quot;So
this is about me skipping class now?&quot; I yell. &quot;If I had
skipped class, I wouldn't have gotten in trouble!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
settle down,&quot; says Mom.</p>
<p>&quot;No,
YOU settle down!&quot;</p>
<p>Mom
turns to Dad. &quot;I think Chloe should spend some time in her room
to calm down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mom,
I'm RIGHT HERE!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,&quot;
says Mom warningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,&quot;
says Dad sternly.</p>
<p>&quot;FINE,&quot;
I say. I run up the stairs to my room and slam the door and kick my
shoes off and dive face-down on my bed. I grab my pillow and pretend
as if I'm strangling it to death. I don't want to talk to Mom and
Dad, anyway, I want Rose. I don't want to calm down. I don't want to
see a psychiatrist. I hate being here.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">9.</h2>
<content_notice_p((sex with questionable consent))>
<p>It's
another few days before I get a chance to see Rose outside of school
again. It's already more than halfway through the fourth quarter, on
a Saturday afternoon. Rose is kind of busy with school but she found
some time to hang out with me today. We're in the basement now,
relaxing a bit. The couch here is nothing like the couches Rose has
at her house, but it's much nicer not having Rose's parents around.</p>
<p>We've
just watched a movie about a young couple who almost fall apart
because of a long series of hilarious misunderstandings. They get
back together at the end, though, and everyone is happy. Rose and I
are snuggling together on the couch now that it's over.</p>
<p>&quot;Rose,
you're the best ever,&quot; I say. &quot;I wish I was like you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,
come off it,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm not all that. I'd rather be
like you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But
everyone says you're a great person,&quot; I say. &quot;They even
gave you that Best Role Model award.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's
mostly just because I get good grades and volunteer for the Special
Olympics.&quot;</p>
<p>I
didn't know she did that. &quot;Wait,&quot; I say, &quot;Doesn't that
actually mean you're a good person? I mean, if you volunteer?&quot;</p>
<p>She
laughs nastily. &quot;My mom signed me up for it. Do you expect me to
<em>stop</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,
you COULD have stopped,&quot; I say, &quot;But if you stuck with it,
y—&quot;</p>
<p>Rose
puts a hand over my mouth. It sends a thrill through me. I press
closer to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
you're supposed to be the person who doesn't say that! I can get
anyone else to tell me that I'm the best person ever, but I'm not!
I'm not smart like Emma or talented like Alicia or even... even
confident like you.&quot;</p>
<p>I
put my arms around her and squeeze her tight.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,
stop that,&quot; she says, smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,
for me, you'll always—&quot; I try to sit up straight to be able to
look her right in the face instead of in the neck, but somehow I mess
up and end up toppling us both over instead. I end up sprawled on the
couch with Rose on top of me. I write and twist a bit under her
weight. Rose gets her arms free and pushes herself up off me.</p>
<p>&quot;No,
don't get up,&quot; I say. &quot;I think I like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You
like being squished?&quot; She smiles.</p>
<p>I
pull her down again. Her body presses into the whole length of my
body, and her mouth is right above my eyes. I blurt out, &quot;I want
you to hold me down and kiss me and rub yourself against me and touch
me in my...&quot;</p>
<p>Rose
turns bright red. &quot;You mean like <em>sex</em>?&quot; she giggles.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,
like sex!&quot; I say. Although obviously it won't ACTUALLY be sex
because we're both girls. &quot;You can pretend to be a boy and push
me down and stuff. Then I can do you after if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>A
minute later our clothes are strewn across the room. The couch turns
out to be too awkward, so we just go on the floor. Rose pushes me
over on my back and kisses me hard. Her weight forces me down into
the thick carpet.</p>
<p>&quot;Grab
my wrists,&quot; I whisper. She takes my wrists in her hands and pins
them to the floor. I twist my body against her body, but I can't get
away. It feels really intense.</p>
<p>Rose
lets go. &quot;What do you want me to do now?&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,
if you...&quot; I say. I take one of her hands and put it between my
legs.</p>
<p>&quot;You
want me to, like...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p>Rose's
face looks distracted above me. I feel her wiggle a finger inside me
and push around a bit. &quot;Is that good?&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;I
guess so,&quot; I say. &quot;Keep going.&quot;</p>
<p>She
tries. I guess it feels kind of nice. It isn't really like I hoped it
would be, though. I think I liked the other part better.</p>
<p>I
tell Rose she can stop now. She pulls out her finger and rolls over
to sit next to me. She stares at her finger for a moment and then
wipes it on the carpet.</p>
<p>I
scramble up into a crouch next to her. &quot;Your turn,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>She
hesitates a bit and then lowers herself down. I didn't know it was
possible to have good posture while lying flat on your back with no
clothes on, but Rose does it. Her body is long and lean and smooth
and all laid out just for me. It actually feels a little
intimidating. I'm a lot smaller than she is and I slouch all the time
and bite my nails.</p>
<p>&quot;This
doesn't feel right,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;You
don't have to do it if you don't want to,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;You
did it for me,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
not sure I'd like it that much anyway,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>I
sit back down on my butt. Then I say, &quot;You should tell me what
you DO like. I want you to enjoy this too.&quot;</p>
<p>She
sits up in a smooth motion and puts one arm over her knees and stares
into space. The way she's sitting reminds me of one of those
sculptures of naked boys from the Greeks or whatever that we looked
at in books in Art class. And that makes me notice that she's
actually kind of muscular, too, in a subtle sort of way. I think she
tries a lot harder at P.E. than I do, anyway. If Ms. Jarvis wasn't so
strict then I would probably spend the whole period reading books or
something.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
not really sure what I like,&quot; says Rose.</p>
<p>I
help her up and we go and cuddle naked on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;In
books when people have sex the boy always touches the girl's
breasts,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;You
want to try that?&quot; Rose puts a hand on my chest. Her hand is
really soft, but mostly it just feels weird.</p>
<p>&quot;It
feels kinda weird,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>Rose
takes her hand away. &quot;Maybe it's because yours aren't completely
in yet.&quot;</p>
<p>I
try hers. I'm jealous of how firm they feel under my hand. I rub a
little and wait for her to respond, but she just kind of stares into
space. &quot;How is it for you?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,
I don't know,&quot; she says. &quot;Maybe we should just get dressed
and do something else.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why
get dressed?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>So
we don't. It's much more comfortable to be naked, anyway. We spend a
while playing cards. Rose usually wins when we play because she's a
lot smarter than I am, but that's okay because I don't mind losing. I
usually do a little better when we're playing at my house because
Rose always forgets that the Four of Spades and the Ten of Hearts are
missing from my deck, but this time, she beats me every game anyway.
She's really good at cards.</p>
<p>In
the middle of our fifth game, there's a ringing sound. I jump.</p>
<p>&quot;It's
just my phone,&quot; says Rose.</p>
<p>&quot;I
didn't know you had a phone,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>She
smiles. &quot;I've only had it since last month. My parents gave it
to me because they said I've been very responsible.&quot; She digs
her phone out of her bags and answers it. She exchanges a few words,
and stops smiling. Then she puts the phone away and starts getting
dressed in a hurry.</p>
<p>&quot;What
is it?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Katherine,&quot;
says Rose.</p>
<p>&quot;What
about Katherine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's...
she's not in good shape.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh...&quot;
I say. I don't see why that means Rose has to run off on me.</p>
<p>&quot;She's
my friend! Leah's my friend! I need to go help them!&quot; Rose looks
like she's going to cry.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,
okay,&quot; I say. I still don't get what Rose is so upset about, but
I don't want to make her cry. 
</p>
<p>&quot;Are
you going to come?&quot; says Rose. &quot;Katherine would want you
there.&quot;</p>
<p>I
didn't know Katherine liked me. I've only met her a few times. Or
maybe it's just Rose who thinks that. Either way, it looks like Rose
wants me to come, so I start getting dressed and ready to go.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">10.</h2>
<content_notice_p((domestic abuse))>
<p>It's
starting to get dark when we get to Leah's house. Rose and I walk up
to the front door and ring the doorbell. A call of &quot;Come in!&quot;
echoes from somewhere inside the house. Rose hesitates for a few
seconds, so I just walk up and open the door.</p>
<p>The
inside of Leah's house looks like it was designed by someone who
never had a sad moment in their life. It's not like Rose's house,
where everything is shiny and pristine and dignified. It's all big
rooms and pastel colors and fuzzy carpets. Even some of the WALLS
have fuzzy carpets on them. I run my hand through one of the wall
carpets while we walk.</p>
<p>Pretty
soon we get to the room where everyone else is. In the bigness of the
room, it doesn't look like such a big group, but there's a lot of
people there. There's Katherine, of course, sitting on a soft chair,
and Janet with her eyes closed and her arms wrapped around Katherine,
and Leah on the floor next to them with a box of tissues. Even
Maureen is there, and a few other girls I don't know, and a
shy-looking boy who looks like he must be Leah's brother. I feel like
I'm intruding on something. I'm the one who's weird and different. I
bet none of THEM is failing their classes and having to go see a
psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Katherine
keeps crying quietly for a while. I don't know what I'm supposed to
do while she's just crying. I go and sit down next to where Maureen
is sitting. Rose goes and sits next to Leah. Then Katherine starts
trying to talk. She keeps starting to say something, but then
stopping and crying again. It's really annoying. I wish she'd either
wait and calm down first, or just get on with it. I try to whisper
something to Maureen, but she just shushes me.</p>
<p>Katherine
says, &quot;She's leaving in three days.&quot; We wait. She goes on.
&quot;Mom's been packing lots of stuff. She tried to take one of our
lamps. Old, fancy ones. I think Dad brought them from Germany. She
was holding it in her hands while they argued.&quot; She stops again.</p>
<p>Leah
grimaces. &quot;Don't tell me they broke it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She
said 'you can keep it' and she dropped it on the floor,&quot; says
Katherine. &quot;I saw Dad staring at the pieces. And then he...
moved. I thought he was going to hit her. I tried to step in and make
them calm down.&quot; She swallows. &quot;I remember Dad saying,
'Don't interfere with this. We can lock you in your room if you
interfere.'&quot;</p>
<p>I
feel myself shaking. Did he really say that? Did she really break the
lamp? They're crazy!</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
are you alright?&quot; Maureen whispers.</p>
<p>I
picture my mom breaking our TV, my dad going to hit her, my dad
threatening to lock me up. I feel like everything is falling apart.</p>
<p>&quot;And
then I just broke down and ran,&quot; Katherine continues. &quot;He's
going to apologize for saying that tomorrow. He's going to think
better of it and apologize. He always does.&quot;</p>
<p>And
Katherine just says it out loud, that it's happened more than once,
and the world still hasn't ended.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,
your eyes got really wide,&quot; whispers Maureen.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
such a wreck. I can't deal with it anymore. Three more days of this,&quot;
Katherine sobs. &quot;I don't know what they're doing now. I hope
they're not fighting. I should have stayed there and made sure they
don't hurt each other. I'm just not strong enough. You're all much
stronger than I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;THAT'S
NOT TRUE!&quot; I yell.</p>
<p>Everyone
looks at me.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,
it's not!&quot; I say. &quot;I wouldn't be able to handle it for a
minute! I'd have run away when your mom broke the lamp. Or before
that! You're so strong. You're RIDICULOUSLY strong.&quot;</p>
<p>They
all just stare back at me for a moment. I wish I knew what they were
thinking.</p>
<p>Leah
says, &quot;Chloe said it. I think we're all thinking that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot;
Janet murmurs.</p>
<p>I
can't believe it. They actually all like what I said. They're not
telling me to be quiet or anything.</p>
<p>Katherine's
expression changes a little after that. It's not that she's magically
all better, but she isn't so choked up between every few words, and
she manages to tell us a lot of the other really awful things that
have happened in her house recently without crying very much.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
really glad you're all here,&quot; she says after a while. &quot;When
Leah started calling people I didn't think you'd all have the time
for me.&quot;</p>
<p>She
looks better, too. She's sitting up straighter and moving around a
little, instead of being all limp and frozen like she was before. I
didn't like it when she was limp and frozen-looking.</p>
<p>Eventually
we start to break up. Katherine tells everyone that she's feeling a
lot better now and the rest of us can go back home if we want, even
though she's going to stay with Leah for a while. Rose says right
away that she has a lot of homework to do for Monday, and leaves. I'm
a little disappointed because I was hoping she'd come back with me,
but she's an eighth grader and I know she has lots of homework. 
</p>
<p>I
stick around for a while and chat with Leah and Katherine and Maureen
until I get tired. Katherine seems almost back to her usual witty
self, and I feel good about the way we all got together to help her.
I smile to myself while I walk home in the dark. I'm a person who
helps her friends. I like that.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">11.</h2>
<p>The
little plaque on the desk says <i>Alice Fawcett, M.D.</i> I'm staring
at it because it's shiny and I don't want to look at Mom and Dad. We
get stuck waiting for a few minutes before the real Alice Fawcett
hurries in and hangs up her coat.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
very sorry, Mrs. Martin, Mr. Martin,&quot; says Dr. Fawcett breezily.
&quot;And you must be Chloe. Your parents have told me so much about
you.&quot;</p>
<p>She
doesn't look the way I expected her to. Mom told me I should be on my
best behavior when meeting <em>Doctor</em> Fawcett, so I had thought
she'd be really uptight and formal, but Mom and Dad are more
dressed-up than she is.</p>
<p>&quot;So,
Chloe, do you know why you're here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot;
I say. &quot;My parents brought me.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr.
Fawcett smiles at me. I don't like it. &quot;And do you know what
they brought you here for?&quot;</p>
<p>I
don't want to say something that my parents wouldn't agree with. I
glance over at Mom. &quot;I've been having trouble in school, Dr.
Fawcett,&quot; I say hesitantly.</p>
<p>Dr.
Fawcett frowns. She asks me a few more stupid questions like that and
then asks my parents if she can talk to me alone. They say it's okay.</p>
<p>Dr.
Fawcett brings me through a door into another room. This room is
nice. It has a bookshelf on one wall and a few cushioned chairs. Dr.
Fawcett sits down in a chair and points out another chair for me,
then picks up a notepad. I sit down. The chair is comfortable, but
I'm really nervous about what we're going to do.</p>
<p>&quot;How
are you feeling?&quot; says Dr. Fawcett.</p>
<p>&quot;A
little nervous,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Is
anything I'm doing making you nervous?&quot;</p>
<p>Everything
she's doing is making me nervous. &quot;No,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Is
there anything in particular you're worrying about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're
gonna say I'm weird. Like, messed-up. Not like the other kids.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr.
Fawcett pauses. &quot;Do you think you're like other kids?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do
you want to be like other kids?&quot;</p>
<p>I
don't like that question. I want to be like Rose. But I don't want to
be like just any other kid. &quot;I guess not,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Do
you think you're 'weird'? Or 'messed up'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No
way!&quot;</p>
<p>Dr.
Fawcett smiles in the way I don't like. &quot;Then I can't tell you
that you're any of those things,&quot; she says. &quot;That's for you
to decide. I <em>can</em> tell you things that might help you or your
parents understand how you function, as long as you work with me. Do
you understand?&quot;</p>
<p>I
guess I sort of understand. &quot;Yes,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>There's
a bit of an awkward silence after that.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,”
says Dr Fawcett, “Your mother tells me there was a situation where
you knocked over a desk during class. Is this true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can
you tell me about what happened?&quot;</p>
<p>I
tell her about how Maureen hurt her leg and how Miss Williams was
really mean to her and how I yelled at her and tipped over the desk.</p>
<p>&quot;So
when the teacher said those things to your friend, that made you
angry?&quot; says Dr. Fawcett.</p>
<p>&quot;I
wasn't angry like I wanted to hurt her,&quot; I said. &quot;I just
wanted it to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But
you thought she was making your friend's pain worse, and that was
distressing to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Keeping
your friends from getting hurt is important to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of
course it is,&quot; I say. What exactly is she trying to get out of
me? &quot;That's how being friends is supposed to work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was
there anything else that was distressing you at the time you yelled
at your teacher?&quot;</p>
<p>I'm
getting tired of these questions. I try to remember. &quot;Yeah. The
room was way too hot and the sun was glaring in my eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do
you think you would have thought or behaved any differently if the
room hadn't been so hot and bright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I
don't know. Maybe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have
you heard the phrase <em>sensory overload</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sensory
overload is when a person is experiencing something that is too
bright, or loud, or otherwise too intense for them to easily handle,
and it makes it hard for them to think or use their other senses.
Does that sound like it describes what you were feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>I
think about it. &quot;I guess it does,&quot; I say. It also describes
how I'm feeling right now. I hate these questions and they're getting
harder and harder for me to handle. It's like Dr. Fawcett expects me
to remember exactly what happened AND be able to figure out what kind
of answers she's looking for.</p>
<p>&quot;So
you were distressed by the heat, and the light, and your friend's
pain, and so you shouted at the teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot;
I say. I look at the books on the bookshelf.</p>
<p>&quot;What
happened immediately after that?&quot;</p>
<p>I
keep answering the questions, but I'm paying more attention to the
titles of the books on the bookshelf than to whatever Dr. Fawcett is
going to say next. I don't want to be here.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">12.</h2>
<content_notice_p((sex with questionable consent))>
<p>The
crowd thunders in the stands above us. The high school girls' soccer
team is facing off against the team from a nearby town. It's not a
very important game, but the other town is an old rival of ours, so
everyone here is really excited about the outcome. Rose made sure to
tell me all that beforehand so I knew.</p>
<p>We're
kneeling right next to each other, nearly touching, looking out
between the same two rows of seats. The game has started out really
well. Our team scores the first two goals in ten minutes and everyone
on our side is really excited. But it doesn't last, and by the end of
the first half the score is 9 to 3 against us.</p>
<p>&quot;This
sucks,&quot; says Rose. I giggle. I've never heard her say <em>sucks</em>.</p>
<p>Rose
pulls her head out from between the seats and sits back on her butt
in the dirt. The mud has come and gone since last time we saw a game
like this, and the ground is all thawed out now. And this time she's
wearing jeans instead of a dress.</p>
<p>I
drop back with her.</p>
<p>&quot;Forget
the game,&quot; I say. I pull her close to me.</p>
<p>She
blushes and looks around quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;No
one'll see us,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>I
lean in and kiss her. She kisses me back and pushes me to the ground,
like she always does. The moist dirt feels slightly cool through my
shirt. Suddenly it seems kind of stupid that I'm wearing a shirt. I
reach my arms around and lean upwards a little and manage to yank it
off. The dirt feels really nice on my skin, and it also makes me feel
rebellious, like I'm breaking lots of rules by getting dirty.</p>
<p>&quot;It
would be so hot if you rub dirt in my face,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;I
can't kiss you if there's dirt on your face,&quot; says Rose.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,
you don't have to kiss me if you don't want to,&quot; I say. I think
it's kind of silly that she cares that much about a little dirt, but
I wouldn't really like it if she was doing something she didn't want
to do.</p>
<p>Rose
holds my head back with one hand, so I can barely see what she's
doing while she digs out some dirt with a hand and brings it up to my
face and smears it around. I bet I look really pathetic, half naked
and with dirt all over me. I feel completely in Rose's power and I
love it that way.</p>
<p>When
we're finished, I halfheartedly brush the dirt off my skin and then
put the shirt on again. I don't really care who sees it because
everyone knows I get dirty all the time anyway. Rose is trying to
clean the dirt out from under her fingernails though.</p>
<p>I
look up through the bleachers again. I can just barely see the
scoreboard from here. It says the score is 10 to 6, with two minutes
left in the game.</p>
<p>&quot;How
is it?&quot; says Rose dully. &quot;Leah will hate me if she finds
out I wasn't paying attention to the game.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're
not losing AS badly,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>Rose
gets up and leans heavily on the supports. She looks exhausted.</p>
<p>&quot;You
want to come back to my place?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>Rose
frowns. &quot;I've got a huge essay due for English on Friday,&quot;
she says.</p>
<p>&quot;Screw
the essay,&quot; I say. &quot;It's almost the end of the year. You'll
probably get an A in English if you don't write the essay at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I
told my parents I was going to be working on it this evening. They'd
ask questions,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm really sorry.&quot;</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">13.</h2>
<p>Maureen
runs up to me grinning. &quot;Guess what!&quot; she says. &quot;Leah's
having Rose's birthday party at her house!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's
great!&quot; I say. It's also great that Rose was born in the spring.
We get to celebrate her birthday right after school gets out. I'm
kind of sad that she'll be in high school and I won't see her during
school for another year, but I'm sure we'll find plenty of time to
meet.</p>
<p>The
other great thing about the spring is all this warm weather. I love
going outside in short sleeves again, or in a tank top when I can get
away with it. The Assistant Principals are all so uptight that they
make me change when I'm wearing one, but I can usually just run away
or hide when I see them coming in the hallways. And I love running
outdoors with my arms bare and my hair flapping behind me. The adults
from the school are all stupid.</p>
<p>One
day I'm running in the halls and I run straight into Maureen. She
tumbles over with a shriek. I bend over her. &quot;I'm so sorry,&quot;
I say. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm
fine,&quot; says Maureen. I help her to her feet. &quot;Wow, you're
fast!&quot; she says. Then she leans towards me with a clever little
smile, like she knows a secret. &quot;You look really good when you
run like that,&quot; she whispers. &quot;All the boys are looking at
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are
NOT,&quot; I say. &quot;They're looking at someone with breasts. Like
Lindsay.&quot; But just in case, I glance around to check. Maybe
there's ONE person looking at me. I guess I can't tell for sure
because it's kind of crowded.</p>
<p>In
the next few days, the buzz about Rose's birthday party is all over
the school. It hardly seems like any time before it's the last Monday
before school gets out. This is when we get our final report cards.
For some reason there's another two days and the last day is
Wednesday, but obviously nobody cares about those days because we
already have our final grades. It's probably just so that there's
time for you to return the signed report cards anyway.</p>
<p>My
grades aren't great, but they're actually pretty good compared with
my usual. I passed History for the year, and I even got a B minus in
math! I feel like someone's lifted a weight off of me. The other
weight, the meetings with Dr. Fawcett, is still there. I had another
one last week, and they haven't been getting any better.</p>
<p>I
can't wait to see Rose's grades since I know she's been hard at work
all this month, so I wait for her at her locker. She shows up in a
hurry. She keeps trying to slip between people in the crowded
hallway, but she's not little enough to really slip between people
anymore. I think she's had another growth spurt recently, and now
she's one of the tallest kids at the school. She keeps running into
people and apologizing over and over again. She's carrying her report
card as if it's hot.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't
look at it,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>I
take it and fumble a little before I'm holding it in a way where I
can fold it open. I put it out in front of me and read down the
column for the fourth quarter: REPORT CARD FOR ROSE C. DAVIS .....
English ..... A+ ..... History ..... A+ ..... Mathematics ..... A
..... Science ..... A+ .....</p>
<p>&quot;You're
letting people see it,&quot; says Rose anxiously.</p>
<p>I
look up from the long column of &quot;Conduct: Excellent, Effort:
Excellent,&quot; and sure enough, there's already someone looking
over my shoulder to get a look. I reluctantly fold up the card and
hand it back. I look up at Rose's face. It's a bit softer now, but
her deep blue eyes are still anxious looking. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;
I say. &quot;This is great.&quot; I'm only a little jealous.</p>
<p>&quot;Shh!&quot;
she says. &quot;I don't want to be that smart kid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But
you're smart,&quot; I say. &quot;Don't you want people to know that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody
will like me if they know I'm getting straight As.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come
on,&quot; I say. &quot;I still like you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're
different,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>I
know I shouldn't be, but I'm really jealous! How come Rose gets to
have straight As and doesn't even LIKE it? I'd be just fine with
having straight As, but I don't get them. &quot;Well,&quot; I say
slyly, &quot;If you didn't want these grades, you could've done less
work!&quot;</p>
<p>Rose
stuffs the report card in her backpack and hurries to class.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe!
Chloe, look!&quot; Maureen runs up to me, waving her own report card.
&quot;I got a B in Math!&quot;</p>
<p>I
reluctantly show her mine.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot;
she says. &quot;That's stupid. You're way smarter than I am. How come
they don't give you good grades?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,
I don't try very hard. It's just that the rest of you are being way
more mature about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Maureen
gives me a strange look.</p>
<p>&quot;What?
Is there something weird about me saying that? YOU should know I'm
not a very mature person!&quot; I say. &quot;What's the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's
just like what Katherine said,&quot; she says.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">14.</h2>
<p>Dr.
Fawcett sits in her chair with her notepad, the way she always does.
&quot;So, we finished up last week talking about how you feel that
your parents don't say what they really think about you,&quot; she
says.</p>
<p>&quot;I
don't want to be here,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>Dr.
Fawcett hesitates. &quot;What makes you feel that way?&quot; she
says.</p>
<p>&quot;I
don't like being stuck in this room. I don't like talking about
school. I don't like it when you smile at me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How
does it make you feel when I smile at you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bad.
Like you don't care about me,&quot; I say. &quot;I'm not just a <em>thing</em>
that it's funny for you to look at.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would
it make you less uncomfortable if I were to avoid smiling during our
talks?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only
a little.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have
you felt this way in all of our sessions, or only today? Is there
some time you started feeling differently?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All
of them,&quot; I say. Dr. Fawcett doesn't answer right away, so I go
on, &quot;I just didn't say so because I thought you wouldn't like
it. And I thought Mom and Dad wouldn't like it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm,&quot;
Dr. Fawcett says. She looks over her notes. &quot;Would it be helpful
to you if we were to meet in different locations?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I
don't want to meet,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>Dr.
Fawcett puts down her notepad.</p>
<p>A
few minutes later, we're out in the waiting room with my parents.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs.
Martin, Mr. Martin,&quot; says Dr. Fawcett. She hesitates. &quot;Your
daughter and I have talked, and she doesn't want to continue these
sessions with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,
but Alice...&quot; begins Mom, &quot;We only want what is best for
her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Under
the circumstances, I think the best thing for her is for us to
respect her wishes on the matter. She will be able to make a fresh
start in the eighth grade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of
course, of course,&quot; says Mom. &quot;I wouldn't dream of
disagreeing. But eighth grade can be a difficult year. What if she
has more trouble?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your
daughter is an intelligent girl. I believe the best way to handle any
situation that comes up is patiently, and with respect for Chloe's
way of understanding the situation,&quot; says Dr. Fawcett. &quot;This
is not to say I'm closing the door completely now. I'll still be
available for you to call if you need advice or if new issues emerge.
But I have no <em>compelling</em> reason to believe that the causes of
the behavior we've discussed are medical in nature.&quot;</p>
<p>On
the car ride home, my parents are quiet and I don't know what they're
thinking. I think I'd usually be worried about what they're thinking.
I'm not worried. On the inside, I'm smiling. I feel like I've done
something right.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">15.</h2>
<p>The
big afternoon comes. I arrive a little late to the party. Everyone is
there already, and Leah must have invited practically everyone from
the whole school. Leah's dining room is HUGE and it's still crowded.
Luckily, I'm still small enough to slip through crowds really easily.
I get to the front and put my present on the pile they've already
made on the table. Between the height of the table and the height of
the pile, it's almost up to my head.</p>
<p>Rose
and I have this little joke between us where we always give the same
white T-shirt back and forth for each other's birthdays. The only
difference is that we draw a new silly thing on it each time in
permanent markers. I wasn't sure what to draw this time, so I just
drew a bunch more hearts on it. There were already lots of hearts,
but now there are a bunch of red hearts to go with the black hearts
and the pink hearts. From the other years there's a bicycle (Rose
drew that, obviously <SPAN LANG="hi-IN">﻿– </SPAN>she's way
better at drawing than I am), and a boa constrictor (Rose's favorite
animal!), and a giant black hole with lasers shooting out of it that
I drew in fifth grade when I was reading a lot of science fiction,
and a whole bunch of other stuff. I've wrapped it up in some wrapping
paper that says HAPPY BIRTHDAY on it over and over again and has
multicolored pictures of balloons and birthday cakes on it and stuff.</p>
<p>There's
a yell from the next room. Leah's having a bit of trouble with the
cake. Katherine and someone else run in to help her with it, and
everyone else hurries out of the way as they carry the giant cake
into the room and set it on the table. It really is gigantic. It's
got three layers and the top one has this big circle of candles at
the top. There must be fifteen of them, but I don't really have a
good enough view to count. And Katherine looks really good carrying
it. She's been really upbeat again in the last week or two. Someone
told me she's started visiting her mom in her new home on the
weekends, which I guess is good, although I don't know what there is
to like about her mom.</p>
<p>Then
I see Rose at the head of the table. She looks great. She's wearing
her favorite white dress, and really nice silvery shoes to go with
it. Her hair is hanging loose around her shoulders, and she's smiling
like she really means it. I love it when she smiles like that. It
makes me feel really proud to be her friend.</p>
<p>&quot;Make
a wish!&quot; says Leah.</p>
<p>Rose
takes a deep breath and blows hard across all the candles, but three
of them stay burning anyway. &quot;Oh well,&quot; she says. &quot;I
hadn't come up with a very good wish anyway.&quot; Then she smiles
sweetly and blows out the rest of the candles.</p>
<p>Leah
cuts Rose a huge slice of the cake. Rose laughs and pushes it away,
so Leah cuts a smaller slice for her. Once she's started eating, Leah
holds up the big slice and asks if anyone wants it, so I dart
forward. I love cake. I don't understand why Rose would ever want
<em>less</em> cake. It's her birthday! Oh well, more cake for me, I
guess.</p>
<p>I
don't pay attention to most of the presents because they're mostly
silly girly things that I don't care about. There's always a few that
make me look up from my cake, though, like Leah's present. Leah
always gives the best presents. This year she's gotten Rose a stuffed
boa constrictor. It is one of the most awesome things I've ever seen.
I wish Leah was my friend, too. Nobody gives me anything that awesome
for MY birthdays.</p>
<p>Finally,
the presents are all opened. &quot;Pool party!&quot; yells Leah.
Suddenly all the guests are scrambling to get out their swimsuits. I
saw the pool on the way in. It's really great. It's like two giant
circular pools put together, and there's loads of deck chairs along
one side.</p>
<p>Rose
smiles with amusement. &quot;I don't really get a choice about what
happens at this party, do I?&quot; she says quietly. It's noisy
enough that only I and a couple of others hear her.</p>
<p>&quot;You're
not going swimming?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&quot;I
feel nice and warm and dry,&quot; she says. &quot;And I like wearing
this dress. Maybe I'll watch everyone else having fun.&quot;</p>
<p>She
looks really happy. &quot;Maybe I'll watch them with you,&quot; I
say.</p>
<p>Afternoon
drags into evening. From the middle of the pool, Leah directs
everyone else in a bunch of games. Some of the games are pretty
ridiculous. Rose sits in one of the deck chairs next to me, and she
laughs and smiles a lot. The cake sits well in my stomach.</p>
<p>The
sun starts going down. The guests slowly make their ways out of the
pool and dry off and head indoors. Everyone is smiling and laughing.
Rose hugs a lot of people.</p>
<p>We
all head indoors. Everyone splits up into little groups and plays
different games on the floors all over Leah's house. The evening
drags on. I find Rose talking to Maureen in a corner. Maureen gets a
deck of cards from Leah and we play Rummy for a while. The trouble is
that I keep winning and Rose keeps losing, so we eventually give up
on it.</p>
<p>Somehow,
I lose track of Rose after that. I'm pretty sleepy. I look around and
run into Janet playing a silly hand-clapping game with a boy I don't
know. &quot;Hey, where's Rose?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;I
think she went up to bed,&quot; says Janet. &quot;Leah gave her the
guest room.&quot;</p>
<p>Leah
is busy with the others, so I go upstairs and look around. At first
I'm afraid that I'll have to peek into all the rooms to find out
which one is the guest room, but it's pretty obvious when I get
there. I find the guest room and step in.</p>
<p>It's
a really nice room, like all the rooms in Leah's house. There's a big
window on one wall, which must have a great view in the daytime when
it's not just reflecting the light from inside. The only light right
now is from a little desk lamp that's built into the fancy desk in
front of me. I recognize Rose's shoes lying on the carpeted floor
next to the desk. To the left is a bed, and Rose.</p>
<p>I
had meant to say goodnight to Rose, but she's already sleeping. The
bed looks really soft. I kick off my shoes and pull the covers aside,
then sit down next to Rose's head and stroke her hair a bit. She
looks really peaceful, lying there on her back. Her face is relaxed,
almost with a faint smile. I really love how she is.</p>
<p>I
slip under the covers with her and put one arm around her and nuzzle
into her shoulder. I'm asleep within moments.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">16.</h2>
<p>The
next thing I know, I'm in a half-awake haze. There are people moving
above me, and hushed voices. I think I hear Rose's voice among them,
but that can't be very important compared with the dream I was just
having. I hardly ever remember my dreams, so I try hard to get this
one back, but I don't manage it. The voices and footsteps soon move
away and I roll over and go back to sleep, with the bed sheets
wrapped all about me.</p>
<bigbreak>
<h2 style="text-align: center">17.</h2>
<content_notice_p((details of a person's psychological reaction to trauma))>
<p>I
wake again before dawn. Rose is gone and I'm restless. I haul myself
out of bed and step out into the hall.</p>
<p>I
stand at the top of the stairs. From here, I can just barely hear
some of my friends' voices. I'm only wearing socks, so I step quietly
down the stairs. They must be in the next room, but why do they sound
so hushed and so serious?</p>
<p>&quot;It's
been happening for a <em>month?</em>&quot; says one of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Shh.
Give her a chance to respond.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You
should have told us before,&quot; says the first.</p>
<p>&quot;Shh!&quot;</p>
<p>I
step around the corner and look into the room. I almost miss the
cluster of kids sitting on the floor. They have stopped talking and
are staring up at me. I recognize Katherine, Maureen, and Leah. I
feel really self-conscious because of all those faces pointed at me,
all looking unfriendly, but I don't really care because the important
thing is Rose. Rose is sitting in the middle of them. She is still in
her white dress, but her long legs are splayed awkwardly on the
carpet. Her hair is wild and tangled and her face is red and puffy.
There is a pile of crumpled-up tissues lying next to her, and she's
looking down.</p>
<p>I
hurry towards them. &quot;Rose, what's wrong?&quot; I ask. The faces
are still staring at me. Have they hurt her?</p>
<p>Leah
says, in a strained voice, &quot;Chloe, I think it would be better if
you left us alone.&quot; Rose shoves out a clumsy arm to cut her off.</p>
<p>Rose
swallows. She lifts her head a tiny bit, but then lets it hang again.
&quot;Chloe...&quot; she says into the floor. &quot;I didn't like the
things we did. I didn't want to. I...&quot; She buries her head in
her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;I
don't understand,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>Rose
sobs and doesn't answer. Leah leans over her and asks, &quot;Do you
want to go somewhere else?&quot; Rose nods clumsily and the others
get ready to go.</p>
<p>Maureen
stands. &quot;I'll stay and talk to Chloe,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>The
others give Rose some space and escort her down a hallway. Katherine
gives me one last angry glare as she steps out of sight, leaving me
and Maureen alone in the room. Maureen keeps looking down the hall
after they leave. I sit down in a hard wooden chair and look at her.
She's shorter than I am even when I'm sitting down. She's not
smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,&quot;
says Maureen. She paces up and down the room. The thudding of her
little feet on the carpet fills my ears. She doesn't look me in the
face as she talks. &quot;Chloe, you're my friend. I like you. You're
brave and loyal and fun to be around. I couldn't ask for a better
friend.&quot;</p>
<p>I
look out the window. The path leading up to Leah's house is lined
with little lights. There's a little pinwheel stuck in the ground
near the path. A car goes by, too fast, on the road outside.</p>
<p>Maureen
stops pacing. She stands at the window and stares out, the same way
I'm looking. &quot;Chloe,&quot; she says. &quot;Chloe... you've done
a bad thing.&quot;</p>
<p>The
pinwheel spins from a gust. The shades rattle.</p>
<p>&quot;A
bad thing,&quot; I echo.</p>
<p>&quot;A
really bad thing,&quot; Maureen says, so quietly I can barely hear
her.</p>
<p>The
night drags on until the gray morning light falls over everything in
the room. I sit on the hard wooden chair until it hurts, and I don't
bother to move or to stop myself from biting my nails down to the
skin. Maureen is telling me everything Rose said, about how she feels
like her own body doesn't belong to her, about her dreams and
flashbacks of unwanted touch, about how she had thought everything
was her own fault because she was too weak and afraid to say no. I
don't really hear it. The girl who's sitting in the chair, listening
to Maureen, doesn't feel like me. My body isn't the body that lay
with Rose all those nights. My mouth isn't the mouth that told Rose
to do those things. I don't feel like that girl at all.</p>
