<p>I've been planning <i>Voldemort's Children</i> since September of last year, when I started analyzing the original series from a neurodiversity perspective. <i>Voldemort's Children</i> is an "Alternate Universe" fanfic - a reimagining of the story in which I explore one possibility of how events could happen in a world where we don't gloss over the implications of neurological difference in general and Harry's abuse as a child in particular.</p>

<p>I'm going to leave it at that for the moment, but I'll sometimes use these annotations to talk more about the purpose and structure of the story.</p>
